NUMBER:	120
MODULE:	apphot.daofind
SYSTEM:	V2.8
DATE:	Fri Mar 30 08:02:12 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	In rare circumstances daofind may abort with a "pixel file truncation
        error" when trying to read back the convolved images it has just 
	written. This only occurs on certain sized images and is due to
	the interaction of the read, write and boundary extension in image
	i/o. For example daofind works fine on a 640 by 1024 image but fails on
	one that is 641 by 1025 pixels.

STATUS:	The problem is fixed in 2.9. The solution was to add an imflush
	statement to flush the image i/o buffers after the write was
	complete and before initiating the read. There is no workaround.
	Contact the IRAF group for a fix.

NUMBER:	121
MODULE:	utilities.curfit
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon May 21 15:12:40 MST 1990
FROM:	sjacoby

BUG:	The errors in the coefficients reported by CURFIT are incorrect when
	points have been rejected from the sample by the iterative rejection
	algorithm.  User deleted points are handled properly, but points 
	automatically rejected by sigma criteria are being incorrectly 
	included in the coefficient error calculation.

STATUS:	The bug is fixed in V2.10.  There is no workaround, unless the user
	can identify and delete by hand those points the algorithm would reject.

NUMBER:	122
MODULE:	cl
SYSTEM:	V2.9 DECstation/IRAF
DATE:	Wed May 23 20:58:47 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	If IRAFARCH is not defined in the user environment, an attempt
	to run the CL in DECstation/IRAF will fail with the message
	"... /bin.f68881/cl.e not found".  This is caused by a malformed
	if-else (missing else) on line 41 of hlib$cl.csh.

STATUS:	A simple workaround is to define "setenv IRAFARCH mips" in the
	user environment before starting the CL.  This bug is so easy to
	fix however, that a permanent fix is probably the best approach.
	Merely edit the file iraf/unix/hlib/cl.csh and change the "if" on
	line 41 to "else if".

NUMBER:	123
MODULE:	imtranspose
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Jun  6 08:37:42 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Imtranspose fails with an "unknown pixel type error" on image of
	type ushort.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except to
	change the pixel type of the image to int or long.

NUMBER:	124
MODULE:	proto.imedit
SYSTEM:	V2.9, V2.8
DATE:	Wed Jun  6 09:22:54 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The fixpix format input interpolates across the longer dimension
	rather than the shorter dimension.  If the region is a complete
	column/line then no correction is made.

STATUS:	Now fixed.  For square or nearly square regions the interpolation
	across the longer dimension is probably adequate.  Other workarounds
	are to use FIXPIX itself or convert the fixpix format file to regular
	cursor input to imedit (which then also allows use of any of the other
	options).

NUMBER:	125
MODULE:	apextract.apscatter
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jun 11 17:35:22 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	When specifying a "line" to be plotted a check is made against the
	wrong image axis; i.e. if a line is specified then it forced to
	be in the range 1 to the number of image columns and vice-versa
	for the other axis.

STATUS:	This has been fixed.  There is no workaround but the task will
	still function correctly even though it is not possible to examine
	some image lines or columns.  The effect becomes obvious only in
	significantly nonsquare images.

NUMBER:	126
MODULE:	apphot package 
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Jun 27 16:47:34 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Due to fractional pixel effects the sky fitting routines in apphot
	can fail to preallocate enough space to hold the sky pixels, resulting
	in a memory corruption error or a segmentation violation on exit
	from a task. This condition occurs rarely most often when the sky
	fitting annulus is very narrow. All the apphot tasks which do
	sky fitting are affected.

STATUS:	The bug is fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround although increasing
	the width of the sky fitting annulus slightly may bypass the
	problem. Contact the IRAF group for a fix.

NUMBER:	127
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul  2 11:41:14 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Objects which fall partially off the lower edges of the image
	(objects with centers near the (1,1) image origin) are shifted
	by 1 pixel to larger coordinates.

STATUS:	This bug is caused by incorrect rounding of negative numbers.  The
	bug has been fixed.  The workarounds are to either compensate
	for the error in the analysis or offset the coordinates to
	larger values (say by using the offset parameters) and make a
	larger image which can then be trimmed with IMCOPY.  The tricky
	thing is knowing when the objects go off the edge since the
	full object size depends on seeing and the specified dynamic range.

NUMBER:	128
MODULE:	IMFORT
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Jul 10 10:33:02 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	In IRAF V2.9, IMFORT has a bug which prevents access to images not
	in the current working directory.  If one tries to access an image
	using a pathname an error message such as "image not found (.imh)"
	is seen.

STATUS:	The workaround is to CD (SET DEF) to the directory before accessing
	the image.  A patch (patch #2) is available in the IRAF network
	archive which can be installed to fix the bug.  Installation
	instructions are given in the README files for each supported
	architecture (SOS4, VMS5, etc.).

NUMBER:	129
MODULE:	onedspec.splot, onedspec.calibrate
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Jul 10 17:07:46 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	In SPLOT the first pixel is ignored.  In CALIBRATE the wavelength
	scale for extinction correction will be in error by one pixels.

STATUS:	These two bugs are related because the header parameter NP1,
	which is the offset to the first valid pixel, should be zero in
	most cases but a bug fix in Nov. 1989 put in a minimum value of 1.
	The symptom in SPLOT is to lose the first pixel but the
	wavelength scale is correctly compensated.  In CALIBRATE the
	wavelength scale is not compensated though the error should be
	extremely small since the calibrations are interpolations from
	a smooth curve.  There is no easy work around for SPLOT.  If
	the one pixel wavelength error in CALIBRATE is a concern one
	could reset the wavelength zero point parameter W0 or CRVAL1 to
	be greater by WPC or CDELT1; i.e. make the starting wavelength
	parameter refer to pixel 2.  Note that this will make the
	wavelengths wrong for SPLOT and other ONEDSPEC tasks.  This bug
	is corrected in V2.10.

NUMBER:	130
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Jul 19 15:14:14 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The radius parameter for the "gaussian" model PSF is being used as
	a full width instead of a radius as intended and described in the
	documentation.  The effect is to give narrower stars than expected.

STATUS:	The workaround is to give a FWHM for the gaussian model instead of
	a radius at half maximum.

NUMBER:	131
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul 23 10:53:43 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The moffat function size scaling (as set by the radius parameter)
	is incorrect.

STATUS: The shape of the function is based on the correct beta but the size
	is scaled for a function with beta of:
	
		beta1 = 2 * beta - 2

	Another way to look at it is that the flux level corresonding to
	the specified radius is different than the half intensity.  The
	actual flux level is:

		F(radius) = 0.5 ** (beta / beta1)

	Finally, the radius which must be specified, rfudge, to get a
	desired radius at half intensity, rhalf, is:

		rfudge = rhalf * sqrt ((2**(1/beta1)-1) / (2**(1/beta)-1))

	Note that there is no error for beta=2, the size is too large
	for beta>2, and the size is too small for beta<2.

	The workaround is to adjust the specified radius for a desired
	radius at half intensity using the above formula.

NUMBER:	132
MODULE:	utilities.curfit
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul 30 17:37:48 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Curfit was crashing with a segmentation violation when it tried to
	fit the second file of data or second image in a list of images.
	The pointer to the icfit data structure was being freed after
	the first file of data was fit and not reallocated before the
	next fit resulting in a reference to an undefined pointer.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except
	to use a script to loop over a large number of input data files.

NUMBER:	133
MODULE:	math$gsurfit/dgsder
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Aug  1 16:27:43 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Due to a typographical error in the file math$gsurfit/gsder.gx,
	dgsder (the routine which computes the derivative of a double
	precision surface) was inadvertantly calling salloc with a pointer
	address instead of an array size. If the assigned pointer value
	is very large this can cause an "out of memory error" in any task
	which calls dgsder.

	Currently the only task affected by this bug is TRANSFORM
	in the LONGSLIT package.

STATUS: The bug is fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround. Contact NOAO for
	a fix.

NUMBER:	134
MODULE:	XC (SPP compiler)
SYSTEM:	Sun/IRAF V2.9  (Sun systems only)
DATE:	Wed Aug  8 10:04:34 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	Sun/IRAF V2.9 will not work with the SunOS 1.3 or 1.3.1 Fortran
	compiler (which Sun came out with after IRAF was released).  The
	new Sun compiler locates important executables such as f77, cc,
	etc., in a nonstandard place, one of the Fortran libraries has
	been done away with, the command line arguments have changed,
	etc. (in short Sun has completely revamped their compiler).

STATUS: A new version of XC is available from IRAF site support which
	will work with the new compiler.  Note that although this allows
	the compiler to be used, and it appears to be possible to compile
	and link programs, the IRAF V2.9 libraries were compiled with the
	old Sun Fortran compiler and we cannot be certain that these
	libraries are fully compatible with the new compiler and its
	libraries.  Also, the default host compiler flags supplied with
	Sun/IRAF MKPKG are not necessarily what is best for the new
	compiler.  Most likely these are not serious problems, but
	Sun/IRAF will not fully support the new compiler until we have had
	time to recompile the full system for a future release.

NUMBER:	135
MODULE:	noao.artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Aug  9 09:24:41 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The general cumulative profile file input for both the PSF and a
	an object type does not work.  The error is can't open image
	even though the file is not an image.

STATUS:	This bug is due to the inability of the image access checking routine
	to distinguish images from regular files.  Because of the order
	of the logic the task always checks to see if the specified file
	is an image template first, decides it is an image, and then
	fails with the error can't open image.  There is no work around.
	Those requiring this capability wil have to contact site support
	for help.

NUMBER:	136
MODULE:	wfits/rfits
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Aug 27 07:37:57 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Wfits sometimes crashed with a segmentation violation when
	files were written with a non-standard block size (block_factor > 10).
	The error was in the code which 0-filled the unused portion of the
	last output block,  and occurred if the unused portion of that
	block was greater than 2880 bytes.

	Rfits sometimes reported read errors when it tried to read tapes
	with a non-standard block size (blocks not a multiple of 2880
	bytes). Rfits was not always counting the number of characters read
	from the tape correctly when the read attempted to cross tape record
	boundaries. Tapes with small block sizes like 512 and 1024 were
	the most affected.

STATUS:	Both bugs have been fixed in version 2.10 and the 2.9.1 patch.

NUMBER:	137
MODULE:	IMDKERN
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Sep  6 11:59:44 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	There is a bug in the V2.9 version of the IMDKERN graphics kernel
	(used to draw color graphics overlays on the image display) which
	can cause the kernel to die on a segmentation violation when run
	as a connected subkernel.

STATUS:	The workaround is to spool the graphics metacode for the plot in
	a file and then plot this file using the IMDKERN task in PLOT.
	The bug is fixed in the V2.9.1 patch, available from the IRAF
	network archive.

NUMBER:	138
MODULE:	images.convolve
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Nov 28 13:38:17 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	CONVOLVE was terminating with the error "Kernel rows are different
	lengths" if the user supplied a 1D kernel without the terminating
	delimiter character ';'. For example the valid kernel "1.0 2.0 1.0;"
	would work but the equally valid "1.0 2.0 1.0" would not. 2D kernels
	did not have this problem.

STATUS:	The bug is fixed in IRAF 2.10. The workaround is to always append
	the delimiter character to the kernel.

NUMBER:	139
MODULE:	noao.artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9-V2.9.1
DATE:	Tue Dec  4 12:00:32 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Memory associated with the stellar, galaxy, and cosmic ray templates
	is not freed in the tasks MKOBJECTS and MKNOISE.  Repeated executions
	(without flushing the process) eventually overflows the swap
	space or causes out of memory errors.

STATUS:	The bug is caused by a simple typo and has been fixed.  Large amounts
	of memory are tied up only with a large number of repeated calls.
	Normally all objects are created in one step rather than repeated
	calls to add individual objects and so there is generally no
	difficulty.  The work around when using these tasks in a loop
	is to add a "flprcache" call to flush the process after each
	call or set of calls.

NUMBER:	140
MODULE:	dataio.rfits
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Dec  6 11:38:42 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	A command of the form "rfits mta 1-8 "" oldirafname+" will generate
	the message "ERROR: T_RFITS: Error reading output file name" because
	the code was not dealing properly with an empty output file list.

STATUS:	Rfits has been modified in 2.10 so that a temporary output file
	name is created if oldirafname is true or a clear error message
	is generated if oldirafname is false, and the user has set the
	output file name to "". The workaround is to avoid setting
	the output file name to "".

NUMBER:	141
MODULE:	identify
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Dec 19 16:47:06 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The automatic line identification algorithm fails to find some
	lines in certain circumstances.

	The source of the problem is when multiple lines in the line
	list end up being centered in the same place in the data.  For
	example if two lines in the list are 4888.1234 and 4889.1234,
	the second one is intrinsically weak, and the data is low
	resolution (say 3A per pixel) then as far as the data is
	concerned there is just one line.  This line will be marked
	twice with the same position but different wavelengths.  The
	complication is that valid weaker lines will be removed based
	on the maxfeatures criteria (for example only the 50 highest
	peak values are kept of which say 10 are multiple assignments
	to the same peaks in the data).   Then after the lines are
	found the minsep criteria is applied to winnow out the multiple
	assignments to the same pixel leaving 40 lines found and 10 of
	the weaker valid lines not found.  This is a complex  behavior
	dependent on data resolution, the initial dispersion solution,
	the line list (the problem occurs with dense line lists used
	for high resolution such as the thorium list used with lower
	resolution data), and the maxfeatures and match parameters.

STATUS:	The bug fix is to winnow out the multiple identifications to
	the same pixel before selecting the maxfeatures strongest
	lines.  The workaround most likely to work is to reduce the
	match parameter so that some of the multiple identifications
	are thrown out based on wavelength differences with the
	dispersion function estimates.  Another thing is to increase
	maxfeatures but this will result in many undesired weak lines.


NUMBER:	142
MODULE:	testphot.daophot.psf
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Feb  5 16:39:13 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	The task psf in testphot.daophot was writing incorrect values of the
	zero point position of the psf "XPSF" and "YPSF" into the psf image
	header. Although this was not a problem for the constant psf fitting
	code, the variable psf fitting code was interpolating in the wrong
	place in the look-up table, resulting in a very strange looking psf
	fit. In effect the coordinate system of the look-up table was shifted
	with respect to the image.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in the ftp archive version of testphot and on
	all our local nodes (orion, gemini, ursa). Users can either get a
	new version of testphot from the archive or contact the IRAF group
	for a patch since only one file is affected.

NUMBER:	143
MODULE:	images.imsurfit
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Feb 25 10:03:39 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	There is a bug in the bad pixel rejection code in the IMSURFIT task
	which occurs when the parameter upper > 0.0 and lower = 0.0, or
	if lower > 0.0 and upper = 0.0. In the former case all points with
	negative residuals were rejected instead of none, and in the latter
	case all points with positive residuals were rejected instead of
	none. IMSURFIT was computing the rejection limits by multiplying
	the computed standard deviation by upper and lower respectively
	without checking for the zero case.

STATUS:	The big is fixed in IRAF 2.10. There is no workaround, except to
	set upper or lower to very large values if you do not want to
	reject pixels.

NUMBER:	144
MODULE:	artdata
SYSTEM:	V2.9.1
DATE:	Mon Mar  4 09:43:28 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The tasks sometimes fail when the output image is in STF (.hhh) format.
	This is due to a problem in how image header comments are put in
	the image header affecting only the STF format.  Note that the
	original version released with V2.9 does not provide header
	comments and so it does not have a problem.  The newer version with
	this STF header problem came as part of V2.9.1.

STATUS:	This problem has been fixed in the next version of the package.
	The only workaround is to use OIF (.imh) format and then convert
	to STF format with IMCOPY.

NUMBER:	145
MODULE:	apextract
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Mar 27 16:57:13 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	For some default background functions and sample regions a singular
	solution error can occur.  This is caused by defining the function
	range to be the entire image dimension while the sample region is
	only a small part of this range.  It probably also depends on the
	function type and order and the degree of curvature in the fitted
	data.  When apertures are read from the database or reset by the
	'b' mode in APEDIT the fitting limits are set to the limits of the
	sample region.

STATUS:	The singular solution message should be harmless.  Reading apertures
	from a database does not have this problem.  Entering the 'b' mode in
	APEDIT (where the message might be seen) and exiting will fix the
	fitting function properly.  Of course if background subtraction
	is not required this problem does not arise.  The problem has
	been fixed for V2.10.

NUMBER:	146
MODULE:	images.geomap
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Apr  9 14:08:45 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Geomap would not permit the user to fit cross-terms (terms containing
	x*y) in the the x coordinate fit if xxorder=2 and xyorder=2, or in
	the y coordinate fit if yxorder==2 and yyorder=2. For higher order
	fits cross-term fitting was enabled.

STATUS:	This bug has been fixed in IRAF 2.10. There is no workaround.

NUMBER:	147
MODULE:	ccdred.mkskycor ccdred.mkillumcor
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Apr 16 16:42:36 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The CCDMEAN parameter computed by the task MKSKYCOR and MKILLUMCOR
	is computed incorrectly in the sense that it is smaller than the
	correct value by a small amount.  The last few lines of the image
	were not accumulated before dividing by the number of pixels in
	the output image.

STATUS:	This bug has been fixed for V2.10.  One workaround is to use
	yboxmin of 0.  The other workaround is to use IMSTATISTICS and
	HEDIT to compute and replace the correct value.  Failing to do so
	and then correcting images with CCDPROC will slightly change the
	data level which may be acceptable.

NUMBER:	148
MODULE:	ecdispcor, msdispcor
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Apr 22 13:23:09 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The combining options "sum", "average", "minmax" do not work correctly.
	The cause is failing to clear an array between each spectrum so
	that as subsequent spectra are added the preceding spectra are
	multiply added.

STATUS:	The workaround is to dispcor each order to the same dispersion
	with onedspec output format and then add or average the spectra
	with imcombine.  The problem is fixed for V2.10.

NUMBER:	149
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jun 10 10:44:47 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The PSF position angle (parameter pa) is intended to be input
	as degrees and converted  internally to radians.  The conversion is
	not being done with the effect that the input position angle is
	being interpreted as radians.

STATUS:	The conversion has been added to the program; a simple use of
	the DEGTORAD macro.  The workaround is to specify the position
	angle in radians.  Note that the object position angles specified
	in the object list are correctly interpreted as degrees.

NUMBER:	150
MODULE:	dataio.wfits
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Jun 11 13:04:44 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Wfits was setting the IRAFNAME image header keyword to a blank
	string if the input image was a section. This was done originally
	to avoid rfits trying to rename the output image (if parameter
	oldirafname = yes) to an image section, but had the side effect
	of making IRAFNAME useless for book-keeping purposes.

STATUS:	Wfits has been modified in 2.10 to write the full image specification
	including the image section but minus the directory specification
	in the IRAFNAME keyword. Rfits has been modified to check for and remove
	any image section before renaming the output image to the orginal
	iraf name. If the renaming fails for any reason, then the name
	specified by the iraf_file parameter will be used as before.

NUMBER:	151
MODULE:	noao.twodspec.longslit.fitcoords
SYSTEM:	V2.6-V2.9
DATE:	Fri Jul 12 08:38:03 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Fitting a single trace made along the x or horizontal axis
	does not work correctly.

STATUS:	The workaround is to transpose the data and trace the feature
	vertically.  This is corrected in V2.10.

NUMBER:	152
MODULE:	images.imshift
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul 29 11:42:28 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Imshift was not correctly initializing the shifts file descriptor to
	NULL, when the shifts_file parameter was set to "", sometimes causing
	a later conditional test in the code to fail.

	This bug is triggered when a user sets shifts_file to a file name
	and then sets it back to "" without flushing the process cache,
	as may happen after repeated executions in a script.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except to
	flush the process cache between executions.

NUMBER:	153
MODULE:	digiphot.apphot.apselect
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Aug 12 15:07:29 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Apselect can sometimes fail with a segmentation violation if the
	input file has variable length records, (as can be the case for
	example if the user changes the number of apertures interactively,
	or if the user has defined polygons of various sizes)
	if the first record is not the longest record in the file,
	and if the size of the variable length record exceeds 20, the
	initial guess for buffer allocation.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except to
	ensure that the longest record comes first in the output file.

NUMBER:	154
MODULE:	proto.fixpix
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Aug 13 12:27:17 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Interpolation across columns with type double images does not work.

STATUS:	Fixed in V2.10.  There is no workaround other than to avoid this
	rare combination of datatype and direction of interpolation.

NUMBER:	155

BUG:	1. Radprof was computing the total intensity of the fitted radial
	profile by integrating (RP) instead of the physically meaningful
	quantity 2 * PI * (r * RP).

	2. The computed total intensity (TINORM)  was too small by a factor
	equal to the profile step size in pixels, although the shape of the
	curve was correct.

STATUS: Both bugs have been fixed in 2.10. Bug 1 was fixed some time ago
	at the request of a user at ST, but was not previously logged.
	There is no workaround. Bug 2 was only recently discovered. 
	The workaround is to multiply the quantity TINORM by the step size
	in pixels, and compare it to the aperture photometry results.
	The two numbers should be equal to within the expected errors.
