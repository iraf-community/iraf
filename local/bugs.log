NUMBER:	120
MODULE:	apphot.daofind
SYSTEM:	V2.8
DATE:	Fri Mar 30 08:02:12 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	In rare circumstances daofind may abort with a "pixel file truncation
        error" when trying to read back the convolved images it has just 
	written. This only occurs on certain sized images and is due to
	the interaction of the read, write and boundary extension in image
	i/o. For example daofind works fine on a 640 by 1024 image but fails on
	one that is 641 by 1025 pixels.

STATUS:	The problem is fixed in 2.9. The solution was to add an imflush
	statement to flush the image i/o buffers after the write was
	complete and before initiating the read. There is no workaround.
	Contact the IRAF group for a fix.

NUMBER:	121
MODULE:	utilities.curfit
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon May 21 15:12:40 MST 1990
FROM:	sjacoby

BUG:	The errors in the coefficients reported by CURFIT are incorrect when
	points have been rejected from the sample by the iterative rejection
	algorithm.  User deleted points are handled properly, but points 
	automatically rejected by sigma criteria are being incorrectly 
	included in the coefficient error calculation.

STATUS:	The bug is fixed in V2.10.  There is no workaround, unless the user
	can identify and delete by hand those points the algorithm would reject.

NUMBER:	122
MODULE:	cl
SYSTEM:	V2.9 DECstation/IRAF
DATE:	Wed May 23 20:58:47 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	If IRAFARCH is not defined in the user environment, an attempt
	to run the CL in DECstation/IRAF will fail with the message
	"... /bin.f68881/cl.e not found".  This is caused by a malformed
	if-else (missing else) on line 41 of hlib$cl.csh.

STATUS:	A simple workaround is to define "setenv IRAFARCH mips" in the
	user environment before starting the CL.  This bug is so easy to
	fix however, that a permanent fix is probably the best approach.
	Merely edit the file iraf/unix/hlib/cl.csh and change the "if" on
	line 41 to "else if".

NUMBER:	123
MODULE:	imtranspose
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Jun  6 08:37:42 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Imtranspose fails with an "unknown pixel type error" on image of
	type ushort.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except to
	change the pixel type of the image to int or long.

NUMBER:	124
MODULE:	proto.imedit
SYSTEM:	V2.9, V2.8
DATE:	Wed Jun  6 09:22:54 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The fixpix format input interpolates across the longer dimension
	rather than the shorter dimension.  If the region is a complete
	column/line then no correction is made.

STATUS:	Now fixed.  For square or nearly square regions the interpolation
	across the longer dimension is probably adequate.  Other workarounds
	are to use FIXPIX itself or convert the fixpix format file to regular
	cursor input to imedit (which then also allows use of any of the other
	options).

NUMBER:	125
MODULE:	apextract.apscatter
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jun 11 17:35:22 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	When specifying a "line" to be plotted a check is made against the
	wrong image axis; i.e. if a line is specified then it forced to
	be in the range 1 to the number of image columns and vice-versa
	for the other axis.

STATUS:	This has been fixed.  There is no workaround but the task will
	still function correctly even though it is not possible to examine
	some image lines or columns.  The effect becomes obvious only in
	significantly nonsquare images.

NUMBER:	126
MODULE:	apphot package 
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Jun 27 16:47:34 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Due to fractional pixel effects the sky fitting routines in apphot
	can fail to preallocate enough space to hold the sky pixels, resulting
	in a memory corruption error or a segmentation violation on exit
	from a task. This condition occurs rarely most often when the sky
	fitting annulus is very narrow. All the apphot tasks which do
	sky fitting are affected.

STATUS:	The bug is fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround although increasing
	the width of the sky fitting annulus slightly may bypass the
	problem. Contact the IRAF group for a fix.

NUMBER:	127
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul  2 11:41:14 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Objects which fall partially off the lower edges of the image
	(objects with centers near the (1,1) image origin) are shifted
	by 1 pixel to larger coordinates.

STATUS:	This bug is caused by incorrect rounding of negative numbers.  The
	bug has been fixed.  The workarounds are to either compensate
	for the error in the analysis or offset the coordinates to
	larger values (say by using the offset parameters) and make a
	larger image which can then be trimmed with IMCOPY.  The tricky
	thing is knowing when the objects go off the edge since the
	full object size depends on seeing and the specified dynamic range.

NUMBER:	128
MODULE:	IMFORT
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Jul 10 10:33:02 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	In IRAF V2.9, IMFORT has a bug which prevents access to images not
	in the current working directory.  If one tries to access an image
	using a pathname an error message such as "image not found (.imh)"
	is seen.

STATUS:	The workaround is to CD (SET DEF) to the directory before accessing
	the image.  A patch (patch #2) is available in the IRAF network
	archive which can be installed to fix the bug.  Installation
	instructions are given in the README files for each supported
	architecture (SOS4, VMS5, etc.).

NUMBER:	129
MODULE:	onedspec.splot, onedspec.calibrate
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Jul 10 17:07:46 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	In SPLOT the first pixel is ignored.  In CALIBRATE the wavelength
	scale for extinction correction will be in error by one pixels.

STATUS:	These two bugs are related because the header parameter NP1,
	which is the offset to the first valid pixel, should be zero in
	most cases but a bug fix in Nov. 1989 put in a minimum value of 1.
	The symptom in SPLOT is to lose the first pixel but the
	wavelength scale is correctly compensated.  In CALIBRATE the
	wavelength scale is not compensated though the error should be
	extremely small since the calibrations are interpolations from
	a smooth curve.  There is no easy work around for SPLOT.  If
	the one pixel wavelength error in CALIBRATE is a concern one
	could reset the wavelength zero point parameter W0 or CRVAL1 to
	be greater by WPC or CDELT1; i.e. make the starting wavelength
	parameter refer to pixel 2.  Note that this will make the
	wavelengths wrong for SPLOT and other ONEDSPEC tasks.  This bug
	is corrected in V2.10.

NUMBER:	130
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Jul 19 15:14:14 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The radius parameter for the "gaussian" model PSF is being used as
	a full width instead of a radius as intended and described in the
	documentation.  The effect is to give narrower stars than expected.

STATUS:	The workaround is to give a FWHM for the gaussian model instead of
	a radius at half maximum.

NUMBER:	131
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul 23 10:53:43 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The moffat function size scaling (as set by the radius parameter)
	is incorrect.

STATUS: The shape of the function is based on the correct beta but the size
	is scaled for a function with beta of:
	
		beta1 = 2 * beta - 2

	Another way to look at it is that the flux level corresonding to
	the specified radius is different than the half intensity.  The
	actual flux level is:

		F(radius) = 0.5 ** (beta / beta1)

	Finally, the radius which must be specified, rfudge, to get a
	desired radius at half intensity, rhalf, is:

		rfudge = rhalf * sqrt ((2**(1/beta1)-1) / (2**(1/beta)-1))

	Note that there is no error for beta=2, the size is too large
	for beta>2, and the size is too small for beta<2.

	The workaround is to adjust the specified radius for a desired
	radius at half intensity using the above formula.

NUMBER:	132
MODULE:	utilities.curfit
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul 30 17:37:48 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Curfit was crashing with a segmentation violation when it tried to
	fit the second file of data or second image in a list of images.
	The pointer to the icfit data structure was being freed after
	the first file of data was fit and not reallocated before the
	next fit resulting in a reference to an undefined pointer.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except
	to use a script to loop over a large number of input data files.

NUMBER:	133
MODULE:	math$gsurfit/dgsder
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Aug  1 16:27:43 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Due to a typographical error in the file math$gsurfit/gsder.gx,
	dgsder (the routine which computes the derivative of a double
	precision surface) was inadvertantly calling salloc with a pointer
	address instead of an array size. If the assigned pointer value
	is very large this can cause an "out of memory error" in any task
	which calls dgsder.

	Currently the only task affected by this bug is TRANSFORM
	in the LONGSLIT package.

STATUS: The bug is fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround. Contact NOAO for
	a fix.

NUMBER:	134
MODULE:	XC (SPP compiler)
SYSTEM:	Sun/IRAF V2.9  (Sun systems only)
DATE:	Wed Aug  8 10:04:34 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	Sun/IRAF V2.9 will not work with the SunOS 1.3 or 1.3.1 Fortran
	compiler (which Sun came out with after IRAF was released).  The
	new Sun compiler locates important executables such as f77, cc,
	etc., in a nonstandard place, one of the Fortran libraries has
	been done away with, the command line arguments have changed,
	etc. (in short Sun has completely revamped their compiler).

STATUS: A new version of XC is available from IRAF site support which
	will work with the new compiler.  Note that although this allows
	the compiler to be used, and it appears to be possible to compile
	and link programs, the IRAF V2.9 libraries were compiled with the
	old Sun Fortran compiler and we cannot be certain that these
	libraries are fully compatible with the new compiler and its
	libraries.  Also, the default host compiler flags supplied with
	Sun/IRAF MKPKG are not necessarily what is best for the new
	compiler.  Most likely these are not serious problems, but
	Sun/IRAF will not fully support the new compiler until we have had
	time to recompile the full system for a future release.

NUMBER:	135
MODULE:	noao.artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Aug  9 09:24:41 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The general cumulative profile file input for both the PSF and a
	an object type does not work.  The error is can't open image
	even though the file is not an image.

STATUS:	This bug is due to the inability of the image access checking routine
	to distinguish images from regular files.  Because of the order
	of the logic the task always checks to see if the specified file
	is an image template first, decides it is an image, and then
	fails with the error can't open image.  There is no work around.
	Those requiring this capability wil have to contact site support
	for help.

NUMBER:	136
MODULE:	wfits/rfits
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Aug 27 07:37:57 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Wfits sometimes crashed with a segmentation violation when
	files were written with a non-standard block size (block_factor > 10).
	The error was in the code which 0-filled the unused portion of the
	last output block,  and occurred if the unused portion of that
	block was greater than 2880 bytes.

	Rfits sometimes reported read errors when it tried to read tapes
	with a non-standard block size (blocks not a multiple of 2880
	bytes). Rfits was not always counting the number of characters read
	from the tape correctly when the read attempted to cross tape record
	boundaries. Tapes with small block sizes like 512 and 1024 were
	the most affected.

STATUS:	Both bugs have been fixed in version 2.10 and the 2.9.1 patch.

NUMBER:	137
MODULE:	IMDKERN
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Sep  6 11:59:44 MST 1990
FROM:	tody

BUG:	There is a bug in the V2.9 version of the IMDKERN graphics kernel
	(used to draw color graphics overlays on the image display) which
	can cause the kernel to die on a segmentation violation when run
	as a connected subkernel.

STATUS:	The workaround is to spool the graphics metacode for the plot in
	a file and then plot this file using the IMDKERN task in PLOT.
	The bug is fixed in the V2.9.1 patch, available from the IRAF
	network archive.

NUMBER:	138
MODULE:	images.convolve
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Nov 28 13:38:17 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	CONVOLVE was terminating with the error "Kernel rows are different
	lengths" if the user supplied a 1D kernel without the terminating
	delimiter character ';'. For example the valid kernel "1.0 2.0 1.0;"
	would work but the equally valid "1.0 2.0 1.0" would not. 2D kernels
	did not have this problem.

STATUS:	The bug is fixed in IRAF 2.10. The workaround is to always append
	the delimiter character to the kernel.

NUMBER:	139
MODULE:	noao.artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9-V2.9.1
DATE:	Tue Dec  4 12:00:32 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Memory associated with the stellar, galaxy, and cosmic ray templates
	is not freed in the tasks MKOBJECTS and MKNOISE.  Repeated executions
	(without flushing the process) eventually overflows the swap
	space or causes out of memory errors.

STATUS:	The bug is caused by a simple typo and has been fixed.  Large amounts
	of memory are tied up only with a large number of repeated calls.
	Normally all objects are created in one step rather than repeated
	calls to add individual objects and so there is generally no
	difficulty.  The work around when using these tasks in a loop
	is to add a "flprcache" call to flush the process after each
	call or set of calls.

NUMBER:	140
MODULE:	dataio.rfits
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Thu Dec  6 11:38:42 MST 1990
FROM:	davis

BUG:	A command of the form "rfits mta 1-8 "" oldirafname+" will generate
	the message "ERROR: T_RFITS: Error reading output file name" because
	the code was not dealing properly with an empty output file list.

STATUS:	Rfits has been modified in 2.10 so that a temporary output file
	name is created if oldirafname is true or a clear error message
	is generated if oldirafname is false, and the user has set the
	output file name to "". The workaround is to avoid setting
	the output file name to "".

NUMBER:	141
MODULE:	identify
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Dec 19 16:47:06 MST 1990
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The automatic line identification algorithm fails to find some
	lines in certain circumstances.

	The source of the problem is when multiple lines in the line
	list end up being centered in the same place in the data.  For
	example if two lines in the list are 4888.1234 and 4889.1234,
	the second one is intrinsically weak, and the data is low
	resolution (say 3A per pixel) then as far as the data is
	concerned there is just one line.  This line will be marked
	twice with the same position but different wavelengths.  The
	complication is that valid weaker lines will be removed based
	on the maxfeatures criteria (for example only the 50 highest
	peak values are kept of which say 10 are multiple assignments
	to the same peaks in the data).   Then after the lines are
	found the minsep criteria is applied to winnow out the multiple
	assignments to the same pixel leaving 40 lines found and 10 of
	the weaker valid lines not found.  This is a complex  behavior
	dependent on data resolution, the initial dispersion solution,
	the line list (the problem occurs with dense line lists used
	for high resolution such as the thorium list used with lower
	resolution data), and the maxfeatures and match parameters.

STATUS:	The bug fix is to winnow out the multiple identifications to
	the same pixel before selecting the maxfeatures strongest
	lines.  The workaround most likely to work is to reduce the
	match parameter so that some of the multiple identifications
	are thrown out based on wavelength differences with the
	dispersion function estimates.  Another thing is to increase
	maxfeatures but this will result in many undesired weak lines.


NUMBER:	142
MODULE:	testphot.daophot.psf
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Feb  5 16:39:13 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	The task psf in testphot.daophot was writing incorrect values of the
	zero point position of the psf "XPSF" and "YPSF" into the psf image
	header. Although this was not a problem for the constant psf fitting
	code, the variable psf fitting code was interpolating in the wrong
	place in the look-up table, resulting in a very strange looking psf
	fit. In effect the coordinate system of the look-up table was shifted
	with respect to the image.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in the ftp archive version of testphot and on
	all our local nodes (orion, gemini, ursa). Users can either get a
	new version of testphot from the archive or contact the IRAF group
	for a patch since only one file is affected.

NUMBER:	143
MODULE:	images.imsurfit
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Feb 25 10:03:39 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	There is a bug in the bad pixel rejection code in the IMSURFIT task
	which occurs when the parameter upper > 0.0 and lower = 0.0, or
	if lower > 0.0 and upper = 0.0. In the former case all points with
	negative residuals were rejected instead of none, and in the latter
	case all points with positive residuals were rejected instead of
	none. IMSURFIT was computing the rejection limits by multiplying
	the computed standard deviation by upper and lower respectively
	without checking for the zero case.

STATUS:	The big is fixed in IRAF 2.10. There is no workaround, except to
	set upper or lower to very large values if you do not want to
	reject pixels.

NUMBER:	144
MODULE:	artdata
SYSTEM:	V2.9.1
DATE:	Mon Mar  4 09:43:28 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The tasks sometimes fail when the output image is in STF (.hhh) format.
	This is due to a problem in how image header comments are put in
	the image header affecting only the STF format.  Note that the
	original version released with V2.9 does not provide header
	comments and so it does not have a problem.  The newer version with
	this STF header problem came as part of V2.9.1.

STATUS:	This problem has been fixed in the next version of the package.
	The only workaround is to use OIF (.imh) format and then convert
	to STF format with IMCOPY.

NUMBER:	145
MODULE:	apextract
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Wed Mar 27 16:57:13 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	For some default background functions and sample regions a singular
	solution error can occur.  This is caused by defining the function
	range to be the entire image dimension while the sample region is
	only a small part of this range.  It probably also depends on the
	function type and order and the degree of curvature in the fitted
	data.  When apertures are read from the database or reset by the
	'b' mode in APEDIT the fitting limits are set to the limits of the
	sample region.

STATUS:	The singular solution message should be harmless.  Reading apertures
	from a database does not have this problem.  Entering the 'b' mode in
	APEDIT (where the message might be seen) and exiting will fix the
	fitting function properly.  Of course if background subtraction
	is not required this problem does not arise.  The problem has
	been fixed for V2.10.

NUMBER:	146
MODULE:	images.geomap
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Apr  9 14:08:45 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Geomap would not permit the user to fit cross-terms (terms containing
	x*y) in the the x coordinate fit if xxorder=2 and xyorder=2, or in
	the y coordinate fit if yxorder==2 and yyorder=2. For higher order
	fits cross-term fitting was enabled.

STATUS:	This bug has been fixed in IRAF 2.10. There is no workaround.

NUMBER:	147
MODULE:	ccdred.mkskycor ccdred.mkillumcor
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Apr 16 16:42:36 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The CCDMEAN parameter computed by the task MKSKYCOR and MKILLUMCOR
	is computed incorrectly in the sense that it is smaller than the
	correct value by a small amount.  The last few lines of the image
	were not accumulated before dividing by the number of pixels in
	the output image.

STATUS:	This bug has been fixed for V2.10.  One workaround is to use
	yboxmin of 0.  The other workaround is to use IMSTATISTICS and
	HEDIT to compute and replace the correct value.  Failing to do so
	and then correcting images with CCDPROC will slightly change the
	data level which may be acceptable.

NUMBER:	148
MODULE:	ecdispcor, msdispcor
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Apr 22 13:23:09 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The combining options "sum", "average", "minmax" do not work correctly.
	The cause is failing to clear an array between each spectrum so
	that as subsequent spectra are added the preceding spectra are
	multiply added.

STATUS:	The workaround is to dispcor each order to the same dispersion
	with onedspec output format and then add or average the spectra
	with imcombine.  The problem is fixed for V2.10.

NUMBER:	149
MODULE:	artdata.mkobjects
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jun 10 10:44:47 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	The PSF position angle (parameter pa) is intended to be input
	as degrees and converted  internally to radians.  The conversion is
	not being done with the effect that the input position angle is
	being interpreted as radians.

STATUS:	The conversion has been added to the program; a simple use of
	the DEGTORAD macro.  The workaround is to specify the position
	angle in radians.  Note that the object position angles specified
	in the object list are correctly interpreted as degrees.

NUMBER:	150
MODULE:	dataio.wfits
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Jun 11 13:04:44 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Wfits was setting the IRAFNAME image header keyword to a blank
	string if the input image was a section. This was done originally
	to avoid rfits trying to rename the output image (if parameter
	oldirafname = yes) to an image section, but had the side effect
	of making IRAFNAME useless for book-keeping purposes.

STATUS:	Wfits has been modified in 2.10 to write the full image specification
	including the image section but minus the directory specification
	in the IRAFNAME keyword. Rfits has been modified to check for and remove
	any image section before renaming the output image to the orginal
	iraf name. If the renaming fails for any reason, then the name
	specified by the iraf_file parameter will be used as before.

NUMBER:	151
MODULE:	noao.twodspec.longslit.fitcoords
SYSTEM:	V2.6-V2.9
DATE:	Fri Jul 12 08:38:03 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Fitting a single trace made along the x or horizontal axis
	does not work correctly.

STATUS:	The workaround is to transpose the data and trace the feature
	vertically.  This is corrected in V2.10.

NUMBER:	152
MODULE:	images.imshift
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Jul 29 11:42:28 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Imshift was not correctly initializing the shifts file descriptor to
	NULL, when the shifts_file parameter was set to "", sometimes causing
	a later conditional test in the code to fail.

	This bug is triggered when a user sets shifts_file to a file name
	and then sets it back to "" without flushing the process cache,
	as may happen after repeated executions in a script.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except to
	flush the process cache between executions.

NUMBER:	153
MODULE:	digiphot.apphot.apselect
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Mon Aug 12 15:07:29 MST 1991
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Apselect can sometimes fail with a segmentation violation if the
	input file has variable length records, (as can be the case for
	example if the user changes the number of apertures interactively,
	or if the user has defined polygons of various sizes)
	if the first record is not the longest record in the file,
	and if the size of the variable length record exceeds 20, the
	initial guess for buffer allocation.

STATUS:	The bug has been fixed in 2.10. There is no workaround except to
	ensure that the longest record comes first in the output file.

NUMBER:	154
MODULE:	proto.fixpix
SYSTEM:	V2.9
DATE:	Tue Aug 13 12:27:17 MST 1991
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	Interpolation across columns with type double images does not work.

STATUS:	Fixed in V2.10.  There is no workaround other than to avoid this
	rare combination of datatype and direction of interpolation.

NUMBER:	155

FROM:	davis

BUG:	1. Radprof was computing the total intensity of the fitted radial
	profile by integrating (RP) instead of the physically meaningful
	quantity 2 * PI * (r * RP).

	2. The computed total intensity (TINORM)  was too small by a factor
	equal to the profile step size in pixels, although the shape of the
	curve was correct.

STATUS: Both bugs have been fixed in 2.10. Bug 1 was fixed some time ago
	at the request of a user at ST, but was not previously logged.
	There is no workaround. Bug 2 was only recently discovered. 
	The workaround is to multiply the quantity TINORM by the step size
	in pixels, and compare it to the aperture photometry results.
	The two numbers should be equal to within the expected errors.

BUG:	If the calibration bandpasses are less than a pixel wide the flux
	summation is incorrectly done when both endpoints are within the
	same pixel; the code assumed that the two endpoint pixels were
	not the same.  Generally the calibration data, in onedstds$, has
	much larger bandpasses than typical spectra and so this bug has
	not be seen except in one reported case where a private calibration
	file with very small bandpasses was used.

STATUS:	Fixed in V2.10.  The workarounds are to revise the calibration
	file to larger bandpasses (if using a private version), resample
	the spectra to smaller dispersion, or, the best choice, specify
	the bandpass widths and separations in the task to override the
	calibration file bandpasses and interpolate the calibration file

BUG:	If the background regions go off the image, due to tilts in the
	spectrum such as with echelle data, while the object apertures
	remains on the image a segmentation violation occurs.  This will
	only happen with one-sided background regions as otherwise this
	condition could not occur.  The error is caused by a failure to
	check for an error condition from background fitting.

STATUS:	This error is fixed in V2.10.  The workaround is to insure
	at least part of the background regions are on the image while the
	object aperture is on the image.  This would be true if background
	regions are defined on both sides of the aperture.  Note that it is
	ok for the object aperture and background regions to both be off

BUG:	The intersection points of an image line and a polygon could be
	incorrectly translated into a list of line segments if the polygon
	was concave and contained one or more sides exactly collinear with
	the image line. The symptom of this problem is a larger than expected
	difference (larger than can be accounted for by fractional pixel
	effects) in the computed area of the polygon as it is shifted
	to different positions in the image (shifting by floating point
	numbers tends to remove the condition of exact collinearity);
	or larger than expected differences in the area and flux
	of the same object measured with the same polygonal aperture
	at slightly different positions in different images (again
	shifting the polygon tends to remove the condition of exact

BUG:	In these tasks which output the difference, ratio, or fit
	based on a profile model the profile model is low by a factor of
	the gain.  Thus if the gain is not one the results will not be

	within the aperture which are multiplied by the gain except outside
	the apertures.  The workarounds are either to use a gain of 1 or
	correct the output such as with IMARITH.  The latter option may be
	difficult to apply for APFLATTEN since special steps need to be

BUG:	In crowded regions allstar could occasionally refuse to 1) fit a
	bright star or group of bright stars, or 2) fail to converge to
	reasonable x,y, and magnitude values for a group of bright
	stars by the time the number of iterations equaled maxiter,
	resulting in a group of stars with very poor subtractions and
	large chi values.

	The problem was caused by a bug in the code which steps through the
	stellar groups, subtracting off the current best fit for all the
	stars, to produce a residuals image. Due to this bug, on occasion
	stars which should have been subtracted from the residuals image
	were not being subtracted. Since the residuals image is used to
	determine the relative errors and weights, which in turn are used
	to control the bad data rejection algorithm, allstar sometimes
	refused to fit stars because the residuals were too big or could
	not converge to a reasonable value. This bug is data dependent
	but is most likely to be a problem if, 1) the stellar detection
	threshold is very low, 2) allstar has to do a lot of regrouping to
	get the groups below maxgroup in size 3) the fitting radius is
	large resulting in very large groups.

STATUS:	This bug is only a problem in 2.10 (not in the external testphot
	package) and has been fixed for the next release of IRAF. There
	is no reliable workaround for allstar, but the nstar task which fits
	fixed groups does not have this problem.

BUG:	Use of "zero" in the option parameter (or ymin=0.) or the 'b' key
	with flux calibrated data causes a plot with limits -0.01 and 0.01
	making the data appear all zero.  The workaround is to set the
	minimum value to a number much smaller than the data but not
	exactly zero.  For example setting ymin=1e-30 when the data
	is around 1e-14.  This plot limit behavior applies to all tasks
	(GRAPH, IMPLOT) but is most likely to appear in SPLOT with flux
	calibrated data.

BUG:	When reject=[avsigclip|sigclip|ccdclip|crreject|pclip], combine=average,	mclip=yes, and nkeep!=0 there is a rare possiblity of a segmentation
	error.  This is more likely the fewer pixels are allowed to be
	rejected.  This occurs in the step where the pixels with the lowest
	residuals are added back after too many are rejected and the
	pattern of rejections is such that only low pixels have been rejected.
	The sure workaround is to change the combine option to a median
	or mclip=no.  However, changing other parameters such as nkeep,
	the sigma thresholds, or the combining algorithm is likely to
	avoid the problem.

BUG:	The CCDCLIP and CRREJECT algorithms quietly fail to reject any pixels.
	The basic source code is actually correct but due to a dependency
	condition based on file dates the wrong derived code wes used
	resulting in a mismatched argument list.  This mismatch generally
	results in the rejection algorithm seeing that there are zero
	images to process and so no rejection is done.  The workarounds

	version which is the same except for the ccdtype, keyword

FROM:	valdes

BUG:	In certain circumstance (listed below) when the dispersion coordinates
	are inverted to get pixel coordinates the wrong pixel coordinates
	are obtained.  In practice this is important only when resampling
	spectra such as in arithmetic or combining between two spectra
	as might occur with SARITH, SCOMBINE, or the function mode in
	SPLOT.  It also can cause a problem with the SPLOT equivalent width
	options (giving a floating divide by zero).  This problem does NOT
	apply to DISPCOR!  The conditions under which this problem occurs
	are when all the following apply:

	    1.  Multispec coordinate system images with more than one
		spectrum.
	    2.  The spectra have different coordinate systems; i.e.
		are not all at a common coordinate system.
	    3.  The spectrum aperture numbers differ from the line
		numbers; for example line 1 is aperture 3 and line 3
		is aperture 1.  Note that if an image section is
		used this will change the line number so even if
		the apertures are the same as the line numbers in
		the original image this will not be true with an
		image section.

	In many applications DISPCOR is used to linearize all spectra
	to a common dispersion system.  This problem does not apply
	to such data.  It is likely to affect echelle spectra and users
	who use nonlinear dispersion coordinates.  The workarounds are
	to assign aperture numbers sequentially increasing with pixel
	coordinate when extracting, renumber the apertures with the
	renumber option in SCOPY, dispersion correct to a common system
	with DISPCOR, separate the spectra into ONEDSPEC images before
	doing the arithmetic/combining, or avoid arithmetic/combining
	operations.

	What is happening is that the coordinate transformations
	between pixel and world coordinates are (x,l) <-> (w, a)
	where x is the pixel image coordinates along the dispersion,
	l is the line number, w is the wavelength, and a is the aperture
	number.  Note that the image line maps to an aperture and vice-versa.
	The bug is that instead of using the aperture number the inverse
	transformation being used is (w,l) -> (x,?).  So unless the
	line number happens to be the same as the aperture number or
	the dispersion functions are the same for all apertures the
	dispersion function from the wrong spectrum is used for the
	inversion.

	other than the first invocation of FITCOORDS then the workaround
	is to flush the process cache between executions, "flpr fitcoords".
	If it happens on the first execution then the only workaround is to
	reduce the amount of data being fit by using a larger step size,
	and avoiding multiple runs of REIDENTIFY (since redoing an

	w1 and w2 not equal to INDEF, and rebin=yes the spectra are
	correctly resampled to the requested wavelength interval but
	the coordinate system in the header is updated incorrectly.
	The coordinates may be off by a fraction of a pixel.  For
	example if w1=6400 and w2=6600 the output data will have
	the first pixel at 6400 but the coordinate reported by
	LISPIXEL or any other task might be 6400.25 (where the
	dispersion is, say, 3 Angstroms per pixel).  This error
	is caused during the conversion from logical to physical
	pixel coordinates when the physical coordinates are treated
	as integer; i.e. a wavelength of 6400 for the first logical
	pixel might be physical pixel 185.325 but it is then
	truncated to 185 and the coordinate system is set so
	that physical pixel 185 is 6400 and pixel 185.325 is
	6400.25.  This is a subtle error which may be discovered
	by looking at the coordinate of the first pixel with LISTPIX
	and comparing it with the requested wavelength of the first pixel.

	range; for example, a dynamic range of 126514 for the "expdisk"

BUG:	If there are fewer pixels at some point than that specified by nkeep
	parameter, such as caused by offsetting, thresholding, or masking,
	then the tasks try to add data from the nonexistent images resulting
	either in garbage or a segmentation violation.  The workaround

	number of points than the number of images at some points.

STATUS:	This has been fixed for V2.10.3.  This also resulted in a change
	in how a negative nkeep is used.  In the new version, if one

BUG:	When using STANDARD on a long slit spectrum with a dispersion axis
	of 2 (where each column is treated as a spectrum) the task uses the
	length of the second axis rather than the first axis to define the
	number of spectra.  If the second axis length is greater than the
	first axis then the last column is processed repeatedly.  One may
	limit this by using the apertures parameter to specify just the
	columns; i.e. 1-250 in a 250x800 images.  If the number is smaller
	then some of the columns will not be processed.  On workaround is
	to transpose the image but then some fudging of the WCS will be

BUG:    When converting native floating point to IEEE floating point (as
	when writing FITS files), V2.10 IRAF has a feature which allows
	pixels with a reserved floating point value to be replaced by IEEE
	NaN on output.  In V2.10 Sun/IRAF, the code which does this was
	correct, but the wrong version of the affected object module was
	present in the system library (libvops.a) and in the IRAF shared
	image (S6.e).  This would cause zero to be written as the output
	IEEE value instead of NaN.

STATUS:	Fixed in V2.10.3 or later.  So far as I know the core IRAF system
	does not use this feature but it is used by some layered packages,
	e.g., STWFITS.  The bug only comes into play when mapping of NaNs on
	output is enabled by the application being used.  This is probably
	not a serious bug in most cases, but if the zeros are a problem the

	same problem has been noted previous in bug log number 180 for
	IDENTIFY and REIDENTIFY.  Errors occur when a wavelength is
	transformed to a pixel coordinate.  This happens in a number of
	operations in SPLOT.  There are various workarounds depending on
	what is desired.  A WCSRESET of the physical coordinate system can
	be used though this will cause the dispersion coordinates to also
	shift; i.e. then the shift will move the pixel relative to the

BUG:	When there are many samples to be fit an 'Out of memory" error can
	occur.  This is caused by repeatedly opening an image section
	for each sample and failing to close it.  If there are enough
	samples this can cause memory to run out.  If this happens on
	other than the first invocation of FITCOORDS then the workaround
	is to flush the process cache between executions, "flpr fitcoords".
	If it happens on the first execution then the only workaround is to
	reduce the amount of data being fit by using a larger step size,
	and avoiding multiple runs of REIDENTIFY (since redoing an
	IDENTIFY appends to the database rather than replacing resulting
	in multiple entries).  For marginal cases it might be possible to
	make sure the process has the maximum amount of memory
	available by minimizing memory use by other processes.

	A second manifestation of this problem occurs when using STF
	format (the SDAS group format).  The error is

		ERROR: 827 <image>
	
	where <image> is the image section.  This message means that
	the task has opened too many files and could not open the file
	which translates the error code.  This behavior occurs because
	STF format image keep the image header open unlike the .imh

	equal residuals the equal residual points are added back.
	However this is done within the iterative loop and after
	adding back the pixels the task finds there are now more than
	nkeep pixels and so repeats the loop with the same result.
	The work around is to change nkeep.  A change is likely
	to fix the specific case.  A value of zero for nkeep will
	avoid the problem entirely but with the possibility of

BUG:	The batch processing code was not initializing the task structure
	properly and a "Memory has been corrupted" error can occur when
	processing in batch and the template spectrum has to be rebinned.
	The bug is not seen if it's the object spectrum that is rebinned.
	Possible workarounds include rebinning the data to a common disp-
	ersion and starting wavelength before correlating, setting the 
	'rebin' parameter to force it to rebin to the object's dispersion,
	or else just process interactively.  The code change is trivial
	for sites who wish to fix it.

FROM:	tody

BUG:    Various users have reported a subtle problem in IRAF which occurs
	when SunOS/IRAF version 2.10.2 is run on a Solaris system in
	compatibility mode.  On occasion IRAF code which reads host
	directories may not "see" all the files in a directory.  Hence file
	and image templates may not expand correctly, omitting some of the
	files in a directory.

STATUS:	This problem is not present in the native Solaris version of IRAF,
	Solaris/IRAF V2.10.3BETA.  The solution is to update to this version.
	If V2.10.2 must be used, use host system facilities (e.g. ls, provided
	as a foreign task in unix/iraf systems) to expand file templates.

BUG:    Flux may not be conserved when the IMSHIFT, MAGNIFY, XREGISTER, or

	interpolant.  In the worst case situation, completely undersampled
	data, fractional y shifts of 0.4-0.6, and placement near the top or
	bottom of the data buffer, the discrepancy is ~ +/- 0.3%. For
	well-sampled data the discrepancy is negligible. For y shifts which
	are exactly 0.0 there is no problem.

	The cause of the problem was that the number of edge lines being

	which are greater than the number of image lines then the error
	"WFMSPEC: Coordinate out of bounds" may occur.  Such a situation
	will only occur when resampling an an already dispersion corrected set

	This is due to a logical error in the code concerning mapping of
	aperture numbers to line numbers.  The workarounds are to use
	SARITH if simply extracting a region, extract the spectra to
	onedspec format with SCOPY, or change the WCS with:

	error occurs:

	    ERROR ... - Missing reference for aperture 2

	This is a bug, introduced in V2.10.3BETA, since the intent of the
	task is to allow multiple apertures per long slit spectrum.  It is
	caused by using the apertures from the first object as the
	apertures for the arc reference.  The workarounds are 1) make the
	first object image be one that has only one aperture (other objects
	can have multiple apertures) or 2) when in IDENTIFY doing the arc
	reference dispersion solutions do 'k' after finishing the
	dispersion solution to step to the other (unnecessary) apertures

	weighting or cleaning in APNORMALIZE the result would end up
	scaled by the gain value.  The fix was to divide the result
	by the gain.  However, the default parameters for APNORMALIZE
	do not call for variance weighting or cleaning and so the
	gain and readnoise are not read.  The uninitialized value
	of the gain used to divide the result of APNORMALIZE is

BUG:	A very serious problem has been found in the iraf 2.10.3 and digiphotx
	mknobsfile/mkobsfile scripts.  Running mknobsfile/mkobsfile on files
	written by the allstar/nstar tasks (but not the phot task) may corrupt
	the input files. This is definitely not problem for
	mknobsfile/mkobsfile in 2.10.2 and earlier version of iraf or for
	digiphotx linked with versions 1.2.1 and earlier of the tables package.

	The problem crept in when the tables package was modified to support
	text tables.  The error check in mknobsfile/mkobsfile previously
	used to detect whether an input file was a text file or binary
	table began to fail for allstar/nstar files. The code thought the
	text file was a binary table, opened it as such, and attempted to
	edit it. Although the code was smart enough to detect that the
	proper columns etc were not present and did not do any actual editing,
	simply opening and closing the file as a table in READ_WRITE mode
	caused to file to be rewritten and its format corrupted.

STATUS:	This problem has been fixed for the next release of iraf and in the
	forth-coming 2.10.3 patch as well as in the ftp archive version of
	digiphotx. If you are running later versions of tables there is no
	workaround except installing the patch and/or the new version of
	digiphotx. We have confirmed that there is a problem running
	mknobsfile/mkobsfile with tables 1.3.2 and 1.3.3 and that there
	was definitely not a problem with tables 1.2.1 and earlier but are

	if the the psf model is not analytic. The problem was caused by
	as missing test which resulted in an out-of-bounds array reference
	in some cases. On other systems the FPE error did not occur
	but pixels outside the psf radius were not being set to 0 as intended
	but were instead were interpolated in the noisy edges of the
	look-up table. Pixels inside the psf radius are correct.

BUG:	If the aperture trace functions cross or cause the apertures
	to overlap then the algorithm for finding the scattered light
	pixels outside the apertures gets confused.  This can have the
	consequence of either using data within an aperture or a memory
	error (memory corrupted or segmentation violation).  The workaround
	is to insure the aperture definitions and traces do not behave in
	this way.  One way to check this is with APEDIT after the apertures
	have been defined and traced.  In APEDIT you can examine various
	lines with ":line #" and the data line and apertures will be
	shown.  Look at the first line and last line in particular.  The
	interactive option of APSCATTER selecting various lines can also be
	used though this may crash in the same way.

STATUS:	A different algorithm will be used in the next release to
	correctly find the scattered light points even in the unreasonable
	case where the apertures cross.

BUG:	If the image header has an invalid DISPAXIS value, for example
	a value of -9999, there is no warning and bad things happen.  If
	the value is less than 0 then the editing plot will show a flat
	line with an X range 1-2.  If the value is 0 or greater than 2 then
	the aperture axis will be shown as either 1 (for even values) or 2
	(for odd values)  but tracing will fail and extraction will produce
	a floating operand error.  The workaround is to either delete the

BUG:	When writing out a spectrum with the 'i' key an error about
	the keyword WAT1_002 not being found or cannot be deleted may
	occur.  Because this occurs in graphics mode the error may flash by
	too fast to see (with XGTERM) and you may be repeatedly prompted
	for an output image.  This loop can only be killed by killing the
	CL.  The cause of this is a bug in SPLOT which occurs if there are
	BANDIDn keywords as produced by extraction with the APEXTRACT
	package.  This problem has been reported with DEC ALPHA but could
	potentially affect any V2.10.3-V2.10.4 system.

	The workaround is to delete the BANDID keywords, which are

BUG:	When using an image either as a PSF model or as an object
	model the result is very subtly wrong in the fluxes.
	The problem showed up when using a symmetrical PSF model
	and the resulting star or galaxy profile was not symmetric
	at a low level.  The measured centroid was off by 0-0.05
	pixels.  This is caused by a numerical precision error
	that occasionally adds an extra subpixel to the flux
	computed for an output pixel.  There is no workaround
	though the effect can be minimized by using a larger
	number of subpixels.  However, the effect is very small

BUG:	In rare circumstances nstar can fail with floating operand errors due
	to a singular fitting matrix. This circumstance is most likely to occur
	when the fitting radius is small, the sky is being refitted, and the
	initial guesses for the parameters to be fit are very poor.

	If a group is too large to be fit, e.g. the group size is greater
	than the value of the maxgroup parameter, nstar may fail with
	memory corruption errors. This occurs because the error code
	array is not being properly reallocated in this circumstance and
	the error code values run off the end of the error code array.

STATUS:	Fixed for iraf 2.11 and in the ftp archive version of digiphot. A
	workaround for the second problem is to increase the value of the

BUG:	When using SCOPY or SARITH with a wavelength range specified

	spectra have decreasing wavelength with increasing pixel then the
	limits are specified with the starting pixel less than the ending
	pixel (or vice-versa). The task resamples any and all associated
	spectra such as the sky and sigma spectra.  However, in this
	particular case it was applied without checking whether such
	spectra exist which cause the memory access error.  The workaround
	is to specify the limits in the same sense as the dispersion if the
	direction really doesn't matter or to flip the spectrum with an
	image section.  An example of the last case for a 1D spectrum would
	be:

FROM:	valdes

BUG:	When the search radius is not zero and an aperture center for
	a circular aperture is nearer the bottom or left edge of the image
	than half the radius of the circular aperture the replacement
	region will be incorrectly defined.  This is most apparent with
	constant replacement.  The work-around is to turn off the search
	option (search=0.) or to keep the replacement aperture far
	enough from the edge.

STATUS:	Fixed in the next release.

FROM:	valdes

BUG:	When line or column from a 2D image which is constant (all pixels
	with the same value) is plotted, selecting another line or
	column with the 'l' or 'c' using the right plot axis does not
	work.  The workarounds are to either use :l or :c to select
	the desired line or set a y range with unequal limits using
	:y.

STATUS:	Fixed in the next release.

MODULE:	images.xregister
SYSTEM:	V2.10
DATE:	Wed Apr  3 14:36:35 MST 1996
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Xregister was dying with a floating point error on the Dec Alpha
	if the coords parameter was defined. 
	
STATUS:	The bug was caused by a type conversion problem in an array reference.
	There is no workaround other than to set the initial shifts using
	the xlag and ylag parameters rather than the coords parameter. This
	bug could potentially cause problems on other machines, although
	so far this has not been observed.


NUMBER:	338
MODULE:	scopy, sarith, dohydra, dofibers, and possibly other onedspec tasks
SYSTEM:	V2.10 - V2.10.4p1
DATE:	Thu Apr 18 11:47:29 MST 1996
FROM:	valdes

BUG:	When working with "multispec" format data (echelle data or
	multiple spectra with different dispersion functions as would
	occur if DISPCOR is used without linearizing the spectra to
	the same dispersion system) the SCOPY and SARITH task
	may fail with a floating point exception.  This is caused
	by use of an uninitialized array.  Because it depends on
	what values are in the array it can be sporatic.  It appears
	to be more likely to occur with the Dec/Alpha/OSF1 version.
	There are other tasks which may, in rare cases, also encounter
	this.  This will only  occur with tasks that are creating a new
	output spectrum.  The workarounds are to avoid cases with differing 
	dispersions in the same image such as by linearizing all
	spectra to the same dispersion function in multifiber or
	multislit data.  This particularly applies to using DOHYDRA and
	DOFIBERS with params.linearize=no.  For echelle data there is no
	good option other than to avoid having to use SCOPY/SARITH after
	dispersion calibration.

STATUS:	Fixed in later versions.

NUMBER:	339
MODULE:	photcal.invertfit
SYSTEM:	V2.10
DATE:	Thu May  2 11:11:20 MST 1996
FROM:	davis

BUG:	Due to a floating point precision problem, the invertfit task could
	occasionally go into an infinite loop on Linux systems.

STATUS:	Fixed for the next release of iraf and in the ftp archive version
	of digiphotx. There is no workaround.
