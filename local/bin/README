# BIN for the IRAF system account.

This directory contains working Solaris binaries for the x11iraf utilities
(xgterm, ximtool, etc.).  The IRAF account is configured to make use of
these binaries as installed.  To install these utilities for use by users
(who should be running iraf from their own accounts) the runtime files
should be installed elsewhere, e.g. /usr/bin/X11, /usr/local/bin,
/usr/openwin/bin (for the binaries), and /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults or
/usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults (for the XGterm app-defaults file).  Note the
use of the XFILESEARCHPATH in the iraf .login to allow app-defaults files
to be installed in a nonstandard place. 

The x11iraf utilities are still under development (Aug 94) and are updated
frequently.  By the time you receive the Solaris/IRAF distribution it is
likely that the binaries provided here will be out of date.  Updated
versions can be found on iraf.noao.edu.  Information on new releases,
usage, etc. is available in the adass.iraf newsgroups, particularly
adass.iraf.announce, adass.iraf.system, and adass.iraf.applications.  Send
email to news@iraf.noao.edu for information on how to subscribe to these
newsgroups.  General information on iraf is available from iraf@noao.edu.
