System Notes File for IRAF Version 2.16.
Begun with V2.16 code freeze 22 March 2012.
-------------------------------------------

sys/imio/imt/imxftype.x
    Use of MEF names without an explicit '.fits' weren't being interpreted
    correctly by the expansion code, e.g. "imcopy mef[0]".  The problem was
    that the code determining the type was trying to open the file to read
    it, but of course without the extension would fail, but wasn't being
    caught. (3/24/12)

sys/imio/imt/imxexpand.x
    A string buffer for expanding @files was not being properly increased
    in size when using many files/extensions.  This showed up as a
    truncation of the expanded extension string for DECam images when
    used by MSCRED tasks (3/27/12)

pkg/tbtables/tbtyb.x
    Bypassed error message checking for variable length arrays to allow
    tasks to open a .fits.fz file to access the headers. (4/3/12)

sys/fio/frmdir.x
    Clean up some comments (4/5/12)


pkg/system/mkpkg
pkg/system/isdir.x		-
sys/fio/mkpkg
sys/fio/isdir.x			+
sys/fio/fcache.x
    Moved the isdirectory() function from pkg$system to a general FIO
    procedure.  This was essentially duplicated in the fcache.x file and
    is useful elsewhere as well.  (4/9/12)

sys/imio/imt/imx.x
sys/imio/imt/imxftype.x
sys/imio/imt/imxexpand.x
sys/imio/imt/imxpreproc.x
    Modified to allow directories to be lists, e.g. "@/path/dir" would
    expand to all images in the directory, "@@/path/dir" would expand
    the MEF files in the directory.  Expression selection works and
    use of logical directories is also permitted.  (4/10/12)

sys/imio/imt/imxbreakout.x
    The new template code wasn't properly detecting e.g. "[-*,*]" as
    an image section.  (4/11/12)

pkg/images/imutil/src/imexpr.gx
    Increased the default auto dimension line length to 32K from 8K to
    avoid an implicit limit in the use of auto="dims"  (4/13/12)

unix/hlib/install
    Fixed some problems with mixed use of quotes. (4/16/12)

sys/imio/imt/imx.x
    Fixed a problem with @files containing sections not expanding properly.
    The contents of the file become a comma-delimited list, however it
    was preceeded by a 'CH_DELIM//' sequence that prevents further expansion
    in the fntgfn code.  (4/18/12)

math/gsurfit/gsurfitdef.h
math/gsurfit/dgsurfitdef.h
    Fixed a problem with structure alignment in the dgsurfit.h file in an
    attempt to find a bug introduced with the recent 'tweak' change.  In
    both files, increased the LEN_GSSTRUCT to a common value of 64 to 
    provide some cargo-cult padding.  (5/9/12)

pkg/cl/unop.c
pkg/ecl/unop.c
pkg/vocl/unop.c
    Fixed a problem where the "INDEF" string operand was not being correctly
    recognized in the isindef() function (5/24/12)

sys/imio/imt/imt.x
sys/imio/imt/imx.x
sys/imio/imt/imx.h
sys/imio/imt/imxexpr.x
sys/imio/imt/imxparse.x
sys/imio/imt/imxftype.x
sys/imio/imt/imxescape.x
sys/imio/imt/imxbreakout.x
    Fixed multiple problems in correctly distinguishing sections from index
    ranges, escaping string, etc.  Also added ability to use @ and @@ in
    front of directories.  (5/24/12)

pkg/vocl/bkg.c
    Background jobs were broken because they were calling the ECL to execute
    instead of the VOCL, so the dictionary address differed. (7/5/12)

unix/hlib/install		-
$iraf/install			+
    Moved the install script to the toplevel directory where it logically
    belongs.  Also added code so that if no $iraf is defined, the toplevel
    directory is assumed (7/5/12)

sys/imio/imt/imxparse.x
    The parsing of extension names (e.g. "foo.fits[im1]") was failing and
    being mistaken as an index range.  (7/14/12)

sys/fmtio/evvexpr.y
    The min/max/mod/median functions were incorrectly passing the operand
    pointer to the xvv_newtype() function rather than the type code (7/24/12)

sys/etc/votable.x
    Moved the VOClient SPP support code for VOTable to the iraf system.  This
    is mostly to remove the SPP dependency from the voclient source tree but
    this code only makes sense in IRAF anyway.  (8/12/12)

unix/as.macosx/ieee.gx
unix/as.macosx/ieeed.x
unix/as.macosx/ieeer.x
    An earlier change to the IEEE code for macintel was not carried over to
    the macosx architecture, meaning the same bug (all BITPIX=-64 pixels are
    zero) was present for 32-bit Mac systems (9/4/12)

sys/imio/imwrpx.x
    Writing sections that are reversed what not working properly for INT
    images.  (10/02/12)

pkg/cl/history.c
pkg/ecl/history.c
pkg/vocl/history.c
    The history character '^' was being improperly expanded in literal 
    strings on the commandline.  (10/28/12)

math/slalib
math/slalib/README
math/slalib/sedscript
math/slalib/SED1
math/slalib/SED3		-
     Replaced the SLALIB with the GPL'd version from Starlink per a request
     by Pat Wallace.  This updates the library to v2.5-2 and includes updates
     to the leap-second table to 2012.  The IRAF copyright was not edited into
     the files, instead each file contains the GPL copyright (full text of
     which is in SLA_CONDITIONS.  (11/2/12)

local/LICENSES/GPL	+
local/LICENSES/README
     Added the GPL license for math$slalib and ecl$readline. (11/2/12)

pkg/cl/grammar.y
pkg/ecl/grammar.y
pkg/vocl/grammar.y
    Removed extra commas from %token declarations (11/30/12)

install
    Remove 'redhat' architecture name (2/1/13)

sys/imio/imrbpx.x
    The 'ncp' variable wasn't being properly initialized (2/10/13)

unix/hlib/login.cl
    Added 'sed' to the list of foreign tasks (2/14/13)

pkg/cl/config.h
pkg/ecl/config.h
pkg/vocl/config.h
    Increased the max number of background jobs from 4 to 32 (2/20/13)

sys/libc/fgets.c
    The newline that was being added was corrupting the parameter buffers
    read from the uparm files when parameter strings were longer than
    PF_MAXLIN chars (3/11/13)

sys/imio/imt/imx.h
sys/imio/imt/imx.x
sys/imio/imt/imt.x
sys/imio/imt/imxexpand.x
sys/imio/imt/imxescape.x

sys/fio/poll.x
sys/libc/cpoll.c
unix/hlib/libc/libc.h
pkg/vocl/history.c
    The polling structure was being used as an 'int' instead of 'XINT' (4/25/13)

sys/pmio/pmglr.gz
    The 'rl_out' pointer was being explicitly allocated as TY_SHORT but used
    as 'Mem$t', changed to TY_PIXEL declaration. (5/4/13)

install
    The install script wasn't properly allowing the arch to be overwritten
    by an IRAFARCH setting (5/28/13)

unix/boot/bootProto.h		+
unix/bootlib/kproto32.h		-
unix/bootlib/kproto64.h		-

unix/boot/xyacc/y4.c
    General changes necessary to clean up any "gcc -Wall" warnings and
    errors.  This cleaned up several actual errors that might have been
    caused by NULL pointers and generally added prototypes and ANSI-fied
    declaratations  (7/2/13)

unix/gdev/sgidev/sgi2gif.c

unix/hlib/util.sh
unix/hlib/vocl.sh
    Added Bourne shell equivalents of all scripts (7/31/13)

unix/reboot
unix/os/mkproto
    Converted to Bourne shell script (7/31/13)

unix/os/zmfree.c
unix/hlib/libc/knames.h
    Added a new ZFREE procedure to free pointers allocated from host malloc()
    calls.  Needed to free the readline() return value.  (7/31/13)

sys/libc/freadline.c
unix/hlib/libc/libc.h
    Added a new freadline() wrapper on a host readline() call.  This allows
    libc to get the command buffer and then free the value in the interface.
    (7/31/13)

pkg/ecl/mkpkg
pkg/ecl/history.c
pkg/ecl/readline		-
pkg/vocl/mkpkg
pkg/vocl/history.c
pkg/vocl/readline		-
    Modified to use libc readline interface to avoid having multiple copies
    of the library for each version of the CL.  (7/31/13)

unix/hlib/libc/stdarg-linux.h
    Added typedef change to __builtin_stdarg_start to work w/ GCC 4.4 (10/8/13)

pkg/vocl/samp.c
pkg/vocl/sampCmd.c
pkg/vocl/sampFuncs.c
pkg/vocl/sampHandlers.c
    Changed declaration of rl_event_hoot to fix compiler warning.  Modified
    to use the readline include files however readline itself is no longer
    compiled as part of the binary, instead we rely on the system lib. (10/9/13)

unix/boot/spp/xc.c
    Added "-lrt" to the link line for Linux systems to satisfy GCC 4.4. and
    later compilers (10/8/13)

pkg/cl/main.c
pkg/ecl/main.c
pkg/vocl/main.c
unix/hlib/login.cl
    Modified to allow login using the global $HOME/.iraf startup when there is
    no login.cl in the current directory.  The user is notified when this file
    in used in the banner message.  Note that that use of logout.cl is
    unaffected since the hlib$cllogout.cl script refers to home$logout.cl and
    in a global login home$ is $HOME/.iraf
    (10/10/13)

unix/hlib/mkiraf.sh
    Modifications to allow global login (10/10/13)

unix/hlib/setup.sh
unix/hlib/setup.csh
    Changed the IRAFARCH to user 'irafarch.sh' (10/10/13)

system/system.hd
system/system.men
system/system.par
system/chkupdate.x		+
system/chkupdate.par		+
system/doc/chkupdate.hlp	+
unix/hlib/login.cl
    Added a new CHKUPDATE task to check iraf.noao.edu for a newer release
    of IRAF than the one currently installed.  By default, the file
    '.release_date' defines the current release date, a similar timestamp
    file is kept on the server.  The check is only done ever 'interval'
    days to minimize the impact and may be disabled entirely. (10/12/13)

unix/hlib/login.cl
    Modified to allow a 'loginuser.cl' and/or 'uparm' directory in the
    current working dir to override a global version in the $HOME/.iraf
    directory.  (10/13/13)

vo/java/Aladin.jar
vo/java/topcat-full.jar
    Updated to latest version (10/14/13)

unix/hlib/libc/fpoll.h
    undefined POLLIN etc to avoid compiler warnings (10/14/13)
    
unix/hlib/irafuser.csh
    Added an XC_CFLAGS to add a '-I$HOME/.iraf' to the opts to allow
    compilation of C files in a sysgen.  (10/14/13)

unix/hlib/irafuser.csh
unix/hlib/irafarch.sh
unix/hlib/irafarch.csh
    Removed 'ppc' architecture references.  Also fixed a 'too many arguments' 
    error when sourcing these files with an invalid IRAFARCH set (10/15/13)

install
    Modified to create cmdlink targets for source-only system.  (10/18/13)

pkg/vocl/mkpkg
pkg/vocl/readline/		-
    Modified to use the iraf$vendor readline includes (10/18/13)
