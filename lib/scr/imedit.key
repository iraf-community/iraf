			IMEDIT CURSOR KEYSTROKE COMMANDS
 
	?	Print help
	:	Colon commands (see below)
	<space>	Statistics
	g	Surface graph
	i	Initialize (start over without saving changes)
	q	Quit and save changes
	p	Print box of pixel values and statistics
	r	Redraw image display
	s	Surface plot at cursor
	t	Toggle between minimum and maximum search
	+	Increase radius by one
	-	Decrease radius by one
	I	Interrupt task immediately
	Q	Quit without saving changes
 
The following editing options are available.  Rectangular and line regions
are specified with two positions and aperture regions are specified by
one position.  The current aperture type (circular or square) is used
in the latter case.  The move option takes two positions, the position
to move from and the position to move to.
 
	a 	Background replacement (rectangle)
	b 	Background replacement (aperture)
	c 	Column interpolation (rectangle)
	d 	Constant value substitution (rectangle)
	e 	Constant value substitution (aperture)
	f	Interpolation across line (line)
	j	Replace with input data (rectangle)
	k	Replace with input data (aperture)
	l 	Line interpolation (rectangle)
	m	Copy by replacement (aperture)
	n	Copy by addition (aperture)
	u	Undo last change (see also 'i', 'j', and 'k')
	v	Constant value substitution (vector)
	=	Constant value substitution of pixels equal
		    to pixel at the cursor position
	<	Constant value substitution of pixels less than or equal
		    to pixel at the cursor position
	>	Constant value substitution of pixels greater than or equal
		    to pixel at the cursor position
 
When the image display provides a fill option then the effect of zoom
and roam is provided by loading image sections.  This is a temporary
mechanism which will eventually be replaced by a more sophisticated
image display interface.
 
	E	Exapnd image display
	P	Pan image display
	R	Redraw image display
	Z	Zoom image display
	0	Redraw image display with no zoom
	1-9	Shift display
