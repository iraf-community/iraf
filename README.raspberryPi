Tihs file is intended to record information that will be useful
to those running on the Raspberry Pi.

DISPLAY

The version of ds9 needs to be a 7.6 b5 or greater. The version of ds9 that
is referenced in apt-get is an older version. As an example, I placed the
latest vesion in the directory /home/pi/Downloads/SAOImageDS9/bin.

Then define IMTDEV, with the commands:

IMTDEV=inet:5137
export IMTDEV

The run iraf (ecl) and the display command should be working.
