# IRAFHOSTS -- Tells the iraf networking system how to connect to an iraf
# kernel server on a remote node.
# 
# The networking parameters are set automatically by the networking system and
# should rarely need to be modified by the user.  PORT may be set to "none" to
# prevent the use of networking daemons, or to an explicit TCP port number if
# the default value generated by the networking code cannot be used for some
# reason.  AUTH is an authorization code used to prevent unauthorized access
# to your networking servers.  The value is "default" initially but is filled
# in by the networking system when networking is first used.  For maximum
# efficiency, AUTH should be the same on all hosts (after using networking for
# the first time copy the .irafhosts file to your other local hosts).  Each
# user should have a unique AUTH value (the value provided by the system
# ensures this).  HIPORT is used by the networking code to generate PORT.
# TIMEOUT is the time in seconds after which an idle networking daemon will
# shut down.
#
# The syntax of the host list is "hostname : loginname password".  There
# should be one host per line, with the last hostname set to "*" (match any
# host).  The loginname should be "<user>" (use your local login name), an
# explicit login name, or "none" to disable networking for that host.  The
# password should be "<user>" (use your local password), an explicit password,
# or "?" if you want to be queried for the password at run time.  If an
# explicit password is given the REXEC protocol is used, otherwise RSH is used.
