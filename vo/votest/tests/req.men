VOTable Support

  1.	Users shall be able to use a VOTable in places where 	     req_1
	tasks accept tabular data in other formats (ASCII 
	files, FITS bintables, .tab files, etc) for input.

	elements of a VOTable as standard table header 
	information.

  1.2	Users shall be able to select specific rows and/or 	     req_1.2
	columns of a VOTable using the existing task 
	functionality.

  1.2.1	Users shall be able to identify a column in a VOTable        req_1.2.1
	by the 'id', 'name' or 'ucd' attribute of a <FIELD>
	or by column number.

  1.3	Users shall be able to select a column in a VOTable 	     req_1.2
	for use in tasks that expect a list of values.

  1.4	VOTable Interface code will support the IVOA Standard 	     req_1.2
	specification of the VOTable format at time of release.


SAMP Interoperability	

  2.	Users shall be able to interoperate with other SAMP	     req_2

	message types.

Registry Query and Access	

  3.	Users shall be able to query the VO Registry using the	     req_3
	keyword-search services provided by the VO Directory
	service.

  3.1	Users shall be able to constrain the results of a search     req_3.1
	by supplying additional parameters to a query (e.g. band-
	pass, service type, etc).

  3.2	Users shall have access to all information in the query	     req_3.2
	return record.

  3.3	Users shall be able to refer to a VO Resource (in tasks      req_3.3

  3.3.1	  .... By the IVOA identifier                                req_3.3.1
  3.3.2	  .... By the ShortName? value in the Registry record        req_3.3.2
  3.3.3	  .... By the "anonymous" result of a Registry query, or     req_3.3.3
  3.3.4	  .... By a "personal alias" for the Resource 		     req_3.3.4

  3.4	Users shall have the option to cache query search     	     req_3.4
	results to avoid redundant service calls.

Data Query and Access

	by the underlying VOClient interface (SCS/SIA/SSA in Y1).

  4.1	Users shall be able to use the WCS footprint of a 2-D 	     req_4.1
	image as the basis of a data access query.

  4.2	Users shall be able to query multiple resources at a 	     req_4.2
	single position on the sky, OR a single resource for 
	multiple positions.

  4.3	Users shall be able to specify a base ServiceURL to data-    req_4.3
	access tasks expecting a Resource parameter.

  4.4	Users shall be able to save the results of a query in 	     req_4.4
	a tabular format other than VOTable.

  4.5	Users shall be able to select which data returned by a 	     req_4.5
