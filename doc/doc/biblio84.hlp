\fBBibliography of IRAF Documentation\fR
.ce
February 25, 1984


    The IRAF system is still under development and has not yet been released
for use outside KPNO.  The amount of top-level, end user documentation
available is therefore minimal at this point.  Most of the documentation
currently available is either design documentation or programmer documentation.
We have collected all of the documentation that we thought might be
interesting together in one place, accessible from both the terminal and
from UUCP, so that people would have easy access to the docs.  This bibliography
introduces each document.  The source directory is "~uucp/IRAF" or
equivalently, "/usr/spool/uucppublic/IRAF".

    Each document entry consists of a list of one or files, one file per line,
followed by a brief description of the document.  The file list entries are
taken directly from the output of the directory lister to eliminate the
possibility of an error.  Each entry includes the size of the source file in
bytes (100K is roughly 35 pages for a .ms file and 45 pages for a .doc file),
the date when the file was last updated in the bibliography, and the name of
the file.  Sometimes a single document consists of several files.

    The ".ms" extension files contain Troff source text using the MS macros and
occasionally Tbl; the KPNO version of the "tmac" MS macro file is included in
the bibliography so that you can reproduce the Troff documents exactly as
they would appear at KPNO.  The ".doc" extension files are preformatted 72
columns by 60 lines with formfeed characters inserted between pages, suitable
for printing on most line printers without further processing.

\fBGeneral & Miscellaneous\fR


-rw-r--r-- 1 tody      13292 Feb 26 12:57 BIBLIO

    A possibly newer version of what you are looking at.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf       3550 Feb 25 11:39 CvsF77

    Discusses the relative merits of C versus Fortran for scientific
programming.  Attempts to answer the questions (1) why not just use
Fortran like everyone else?, and (2) why not just use C if you are
already using UNIX?


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      10637 Feb 25 11:57 cover.ms

    A letter introducing the IRAF system, where its all coming from,
what we are trying to achieve, etc.  This is the cover letter for
mailed IRAF documentation sets.  The bulk of the letter is similar
to the announcement sent out over UNET.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf       4518 Feb 25 11:51 history.doc

    Summarizes what the IRAF system provides, and outlines the history
of the project (through the fall of 83 when the doc was written).
This is just a short outline; no discussion is given.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      51295 Feb 25 12:00 irafplan.ms

    A Feb84 document presenting the detailed IRAF program implementation
plan for 84 and 85.  Hard to follow unless you know the system well.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      24451 Feb 25 12:34 irafdirs

    A recursive listing of all the directories and file names on our UNIX
based IRAF software development system, for those of you are curious
about how the sources are structured, or who want more information
about what the system currently contains.


-rw-rw-rw- 1 iraf       8491 Feb 25 13:14 newsfile

The "news" from the IRAF software development system.  Will be
updated periodically.


-rw-rw-r-- 1 iraf      25759 Feb 25 13:13 revsfile

    All revisions to released software, and all releases of new programs
or packages are recorded in the revisions file.  This is a snapshot
of the revsfile on our software development system; it will be updated
periodically.  When eventually the system is released for use outside
KPNO, the revsfile will be distributed with each successive release
to document all changes and additions to the system.


-rw-r--r-- 1 kpno      23131 Feb 26 11:29 tmac

    The KPNO MS-macro file for text processing Troff files.  This has nothing
to do with IRAF, but is included so that the ".ms" suffixed documents can be
reproduced exactly by non-KPNO sites.

-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf       2959 Feb 25 11:57 clman_toc.ms
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      56362 Feb 25 11:57 clman.ms
.fi

    The "CL Programmers Guide", rev Sept83.  This is currently the most up
to date documentation available for the CL (command language), though
the CL went through a major revision in the fall of 83, adding many
features which have not yet been documented (these CL mods predate
the use of the revsfile).

-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf       1234 Feb 25 11:58 crib_title.ms
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      43315 Feb 25 11:58 crib.doc
.fi

    The "Programmer's Crib Sheet for the IRAF Program Interface". 
Summarizes the packages and library procedures comprising the program
interface, i.e., the interface between an IRAF applications program
and the world (file i/o, CL i/o, image i/o, etc.).  This is currently
the only comprehensive documentation available for the program
interface; the "Programmer's Reference Manual" and "Programmer's
Guide" have not yet been written.  Additional information is however
available in the technical specifications for the various packages
(see "design documentation" below).


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      32552 Feb 25 11:59 imexpr.ms

    Describes a planned extension to the IRAF Command Language to permit
image or image section operands in general CL expressions
(CL expressions, assignment statements, procedure arguments, etc.
involving whole images or image sections).  This topic is related
to the "image calculator" described in the "Packages" document, and
is fundamental to the general image processing capabilities of IRAF.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      12285 Feb 25 11:59 imio.ms

    An introduction to the IRAF image i/o package, used to access images
in applications packages.  Summarizes the features of the current
interface and planned future enhancements.

-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      78891 Feb 25 12:01 packages.doc
.fi

    This is the top-level design document for the IRAF system, showing
the breakdown of all the top level, user callable software into
"packages", and presenting the requirements for each package.
Emphasizes the scientific requirements for the IRAF system.

-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf       3408 Feb 25 12:04 spp_toc.doc
.fi

    The "Reference Manual for the IRAF Subset Preprocessor Language".
The SPP language is a preprocessor language producing essentially
ANSI-66 Fortran as output, which was developed as part of the IRAF
project.  The language is reminiscent of Ratfor, but unlike most
preprocessor languages, SPP is a fully defined language.  SPP will
eventually be replaced by a full scientific language with enhanced
high level language support, implemented with a true compiler (as
opposed to preprocessor).

    The "IRAF Standards and Conventions" document.  Standards and
standard programming practices for all IRAF system and applications
software and documentation.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      15245 Feb 25 12:02 pdr.ms

\fBHistorical Documents\fR


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      47655 Feb 18  1983 iraf_ui.ms

    The original IRAF paper, presenting the global design of the system.
Concentrates primarily on the user interface (command language).


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      34754 Feb 18  1983 iraf_cap.ms

    An early document presenting a simple scientific applications program,
showing how the program would appear and be used at the CL level,
as well as roughly what the source would look like internally.
Pretty dated, but the basic ideas have not changed significantly.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf     142264 Feb 18  1983 iraf_pp.ms

    The original design document/justification for the IRAF preprocessor
language.  Many of the ideas and arguments presented are still valid,
though the language pointed to by this document will differ
significantly in detail when it is finally implemented.  Despite its
age, this paper indicates the direction in which the SPP language
will most likely evolve.

\fBScientific Packages\fR


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      43049 Feb 25 12:20 Apphot.doc

    Requirements, technical specifications, and algorithms for the Apphot
digital aperture photometry package.  Apphot will be capable of
performing background fitting and fractional pixel aperture integration,
interactively or non-interactively, in uncrowded or moderately crowded
fields.  Used primarily for digital stellar photometry.

-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      50203 Feb 25 12:28 MSalgo.ms
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      23406 Feb 25 12:30 MSalgo_c.doc
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      26531 Feb 25 12:33 MSspecs.doc
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      12697 Feb 25 12:30 MSspecs_c.doc
.fi

    Requirements, technical specifications, and algorithms for the
Multispec multispectral extraction package.  This package takes
two dimensional multiaperture spectra as input and produces one
dimensional spectra as output, suitable for analysis in Onedspec
or for export on cardimage tapes.  This package addresses the
difficult problem of deconvolving blended spectra, and can also
be used to extract the orders on an Echelle spectrogram.  This
package is nearing completion and additional (real) documentation
will be available soon.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      98564 Feb 25 15:53 Onedspec.doc

    This is a preview of the technical specifications for the one
dimensional spectral analysis package; the preliminary design
of the package is still in progress and the specs document is
incomplete.

-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      21328 Feb 25 15:47 FIeqn.ms
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf     116531 Feb 25 15:47 FIspec.doc
.fi

    Reduction equations and technical specifications for the Filter
Photometry package, used to correct photometric data for extinction,
transform to a standard system, etc.  This package will not be built
in the form specified in the FIspec document (the specs did not pass
the preliminary design review), but nonetheless there is valuable
information in these documents, and they will be used as a starting
point when the package is redesigned.


.ce
\fBDesign Documentation\fR

    Reader beware: These docs were written primarily as part of the detailed
design process, and only secondarily as technical documentation for the
interfaces.  The FIO and IMIO design documentation is particularly obscure,
consisting mostly of semicode; the docs for the other packages are reasonably
readable, though highly technical.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf     196291 Feb 25 13:10 clspecs.doc

    The original technical specifications of the IRAF command language.
This document is somewhat dated now (it was written in 82), but there
is still a lot of information about the inner workings of the CL
given here that is not written down anywhere else.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      61609 Feb 25 12:12 Fio.doc

    Design strategies, structure, semicode etc. for the file i/o
interface.  Provides a valuable but highly technical overview of
the capabilities of the device independent, asynchronous, multiple
buffering, etc. IRAF file i/o interface.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      41323 Feb 25 12:13 Imio.doc

    Preliminary specifications and detailed design of the image i/o
interface.  See also "imio.ms" under "programmer documentation" above;
this latter document is more up to date and less technical.


.nf
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      14577 Feb 25 12:16 Mtio.doc
-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      20274 Feb 25 12:16 Zmtio.doc
.fi

    Technical specifications, design strategies, detailed design, etc.
of the magtape i/o interface.  The Zmtio document describes the
design of the machine interface, and how the machine dependence of
the interface is minimized.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      17366 Feb 25 12:18 TTY.doc

    Terminal control interface.  The TTY interface is used to send
control functions to the terminal, inquire about the capabilities
of the terminal, and so on.  Uses the UNIX termcap database.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      11450 Feb 25 12:18 Vops.doc

    Documentation for the generic preprocessor and the vector operators package.


-rw-r--r-- 1 iraf      20326 Feb 25 12:11 dbio.doc
