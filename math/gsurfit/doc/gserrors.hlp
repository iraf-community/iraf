DESCRIPTION
GSCOEFF calculates the reduced chi-square of the fit and the standard
deviation of the coefficients.
The chi-square of the fit is the square root of the sum of the
weighted squares of the residuals divided by the number of degrees
of freedom. If the weights are equal, then the reduced chi-square is
the variance of the fit. The error of the j-th coefficient is the
square root of the j-th diagonal element of the inverse of the data
matrix. If the weights are equal to one, then the errors are scaled
by the square root of the variance of the data.
