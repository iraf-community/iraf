NAME
gsreject -- reject a data point from the fit
.ih
SYNOPSIS
gsreject (sf, x, y, z, weight)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface descriptor
real	x		# x value, xmin <= x <= xmax
real	y		# y value, ymin <= y <= ymax
real	z		# data value
real	weight		# weight
.fi

ARGUMENTS
.ls sf     
Pointer to the surface descriptor structure.
.le
.ls x, y
X and y values.
.le
.ls z      
Data value.
.le
.ls weight
Weight value.

DESCRIPTION
GSREJECT removes a data point from the fit. The non-zero basis functions for
each x and y are calculated, and the contribution of the point to the normal
equations is computed and subtracted from the appropriate arrays and vectors.
An array of points can be removed from the fit by repeated calls to GSREJECT
followed by a single call to GSSOLVE to calculate a new set of coefficients.
.ih
NOTES
Out of bounds x and y values and INDEF valued data values are the responsibility
of the calling program.
