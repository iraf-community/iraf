NAME
gssolve -- solve a linear system of equations by the Cholesky method
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/gsurfit.h>

gssolve (sf, ier)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface descriptor
int	ier		# error code
.fi
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls sf     
Pointer to the surface descriptor structure.
.le
.ls ier      
Error code returned by the fitting routines. The options are OK, SINGULAR,
and NO_DEG_FREEDOM. If ier = SINGULAR the matrix is singular, GSSOLVE
will compute a solution to the normal equations but one or more of the
coefficients will be zero. If ier = NO_DEG_FREEDOM, too few data points
exist for a reasonable solution to be computed. GSSOLVE returns without
fitting the data.

DESCRIPTION
GSSOLVE computes the Cholesky factorization of the data matrix and
solves for the coefficients
of the fitting function by forward and back substitution. An error code is
returned by GSSOLVE if it is unable to solve the normal equations as
formulated.
