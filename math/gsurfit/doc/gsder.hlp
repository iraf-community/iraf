NAME
gsder -- evaluate the derivatives of the fitted surface
.ih
SYNOPSIS
gsder (sf, x, y, zfit, npts, nxder, nyder)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface descriptor
real	x[npts]		# x array, xmin <= x[i] <= xmax
real	y[npts]		# y array, ymin <= x[i] <= ymax
real	zfit[npts]	# data values
int	npts		# number of data points
int	nxder		# order of x derivative, 0 = function
int	nyder		# order of y derivative, 0 = function

ARGUMENTS
.ls sf    
Pointer to the surface descriptor structure.
.le
.ls x, y
Array of x and y values.
.le
.ls zfit
Array of fitted values.
.le
.ls npts
The number of points to be fit.
.le
.ls nxder, nyder
The order of derivative to be fit. GSDER is the same as GSVECTOR if nxder = 0
and nyder = 0. If nxder = 1 and nyder = 0 GSDER calculates the first
derivatives of the surface with respect to x.

DESCRIPTION
Evaluate the derivatives of a surface at a set of data points.
GSDER uses the coefficients stored in the surface descriptor structure.
.ih
NOTES
Checking for out of bounds x and y values is the responsibility of the
calling program.
