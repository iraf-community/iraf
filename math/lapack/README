This directory contains a small subset  of the LAPACK source files for
the use in IRAF.

LAPACK is a library of Fortran subroutines for solving the most commonly
occurring problems in numerical linear algebra.

LAPACK is a freely-available software package. It can be included in commercial
software packages (and has been). We only ask that that proper credit be given
to the authors, for example by citing the LAPACK Users' Guide. The license used
for the software is the modified BSD license, see:
https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/blob/master/LICENSE

Like all software, it is copyrighted. It is not trademarked, but we do ask the
following: if you modify the source for these routines we ask that you change
the name of the routine and comment the changes made to the original.

LAPACK is available from github at:

LAPACK releases are also available on netlib at:
