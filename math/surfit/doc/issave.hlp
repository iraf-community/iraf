DESCRIPTION
ISSAVE stores the surface parameters and coefficient array
in the 1-D reall array fit. Fit must be at least ncoeff + SAVE_COEFF
elements long where ncoeff is defined as follows.

.nf
	SF_LEGENDRE:		nxcoeff = xorder
				nycoeff = yorder
				ncoeff = xorder * yorder        xterms = yes
				ncoeff = nycoeff + nxcoeff - 1  xterms = no

	SF_CHEBYSHEV:		nxcoeff = xorder
				nycoeff = yorder
				ncoeff = xorder * yorder        xterms = yes
				ncoeff = nycoeff + nxcoeff - 1  xterms = no

	SF_SPLINE3:		nxcoeff = xorder + 3
				nycoeff = yorder + 3
				ncoeff = (xorder + 3) * (yorder + 3)

	SF_SPLINE1:		nxcoeff = xorder + 1
				nycoeff = yorder + 1
				ncoeff = (xorder + 1) * (yorder + 1)
