NAME
issolve -- solve the surface
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/surfit.h>

issolve (sf, lines, nlines, ier)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface grid descriptor
int	lines[nlines]	# surface grid line numbers, 1 <= lines[i] <= nlines
int	nlines		# number of lines
int	ier		# error code
.fi

ARGUMENTS
.ls sf     
Pointer to the surface grid descriptor structure.
.le
.ls lines
The line number of surface grid lines to be included in the fit.
.le
.ls nlines
The number of surface grid lines to be fit.
.le
.ls ier      
Error code returned by the fitting routines. The options are OK, SINGULAR,
and NO_DEG_FREEDOM. If ier = SINGULAR the matrix is singular, ISSOLVE
will compute a solution to the normal equations but one or more of the
coefficients will be zero. If ier = NO_DEG_FREEDOM, too few data points
exist for a reasonable solution to be computed. ISSOLVE returns without
fitting the data.

DESCRIPTION
ISSOLVE solves for the surface coefficients.
An error code is
returned by ISSOLVE if it is unable to solve the normal equations as
formulated.
.ih
NOTES
It is the responsibility of the calling program to check for out of bounds
lines values.
