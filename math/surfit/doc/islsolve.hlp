NAME
islsolve -- solve the equations for a surface grid line
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/surfit.h>

islsolve (sf, lineno, ier)

.nf
pointer	sf		# surface grid descriptor
int	lineno		# surface grid line number
int	ier		# error code

ARGUMENTS
.ls sf     
Pointer to the surface grid descriptor structure.
.le
.ls lineno
The number of the surface grid line to be added to the dataset.
.le
.ls ier      
Error code returned by the fitting routines. The options are OK, SINGULAR,
and NO_DEG_FREEDOM. If ier = SINGULAR the matrix is singular, ISLSOLVE
will compute a solution to the normal equations but one or more of the
coefficients will be zero. If ier = NO_DEG_FREEDOM, too few data points
exist for a reasonable solution to be computed and ISLSOLVE returns without
fitting the data.

DESCRIPTION
ISLSOLVE computes the Cholesky factorization of the data matrix and
solves for the coefficients
of the x fitting function by forward and back substitution.
An error code is
returned by ISLSOLVE if it is unable to solve the normal equations as
formulated.
