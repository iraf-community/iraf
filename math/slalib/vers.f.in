      SUBROUTINE sla_VERS (VERSION)
*+
*     - - - - -
*      V E R S
*     - - - - -
*
*  Report the SLALIB version number.
*
*  Given:
*    None
*
*  Returned:
*    VERSION   c*(*)   Version number, in the form 'm.n-r'.
*                      The major version is m, the minor version n, and
*                      release r.  The string passed in should be at least
*                      8 characters in length, to account for the (remote)
*                      possibility that these numbers will ever go to
*                      two digits.
*
*  Notes:
*
*    To obtain the version number in a more easily processed form, see
*    function sla_veri().
*
*    The sla_vers subroutine was introduced in SLALIB version 2.5-1, so
*    if this function is absent, one can only tell that the release
*    predates that one.
