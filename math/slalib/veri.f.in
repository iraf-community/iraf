      INTEGER FUNCTION sla_VERI ()
*+
*     - - - - -
*      V E R I
*     - - - - -
*
*  Report the SLALIB version number as an integer.
*
*  Given:
*    None
*
*  The result is the SLALIB version number as an integer m*1e6+n*1e3+r,
*  where m is the major version, n the minor version and r the release
*  number.
*
*  Notes:
*
*    To obtain the version number in a printable form, see
*    subroutine sla_vers(version).
*
*    The sla_veri subroutine was introduced in SLALIB version 2.5-1, so
*    if this function is absent, one can only tell that the release
*    predates that one.
