      SUBROUTINE slECOR (RM, DM, IY, ID, FD, RV, TL)

*      E C O R
*     - - - - -
*
*  Component of Earth orbit velocity and heliocentric
*  light time in a given direction (single precision)
*
*  Given:
*     RM,DM    real    mean RA, Dec of date (radians)
*     IY       int     year
*     ID       int     day in year (1 = Jan 1st)
*     FD       real    fraction of day
*
*  Returned:
*     RV       real    component of Earth orbital velocity (km/sec)
*     TL       real    component of heliocentric light time (sec)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1  The date and time is TDB (loosely ET) in a Julian calendar
*     which has been aligned to the ordinary Gregorian
*     calendar for the interval 1900 March 1 to 2100 February 28.
*     The year and day can be obtained by calling slCAYD or
*     slCLYD.
*
*  2  Sign convention:
*
*     The velocity component is +ve when the Earth is receding from
*     the given point on the sky.  The light time component is +ve
*     when the Earth lies between the Sun and the given point on
*     the sky.
*
*  3  Accuracy:
*
*     The velocity component is usually within 0.004 km/s of the
*     correct value and is never in error by more than 0.007 km/s.
*     The error in light time correction is about 0.03s at worst,
*     but is usually better than 0.01s. For applications requiring
*     higher accuracy, see the slEVP and slEPV routines.
*
*  Called:  slERTH, slCS2C, slVDV
