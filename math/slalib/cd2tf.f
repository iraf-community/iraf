      SUBROUTINE slCDTF (NDP, DAYS, SIGN, IHMSF)

*
*  Convert an interval in days into hours, minutes, seconds
*
*  (single precision)
*
*  Given:
*     NDP       int      number of decimal places of seconds
*     DAYS      real     interval in days
*
*  Returned:
*     SIGN      char     '+' or '-'
*     IHMSF     int(4)   hours, minutes, seconds, fraction
*
*  Notes:
*
*     1)  NDP less than zero is interpreted as zero.
*
*     2)  The largest useful value for NDP is determined by the size of
*         DAYS, the format of REAL floating-point numbers on the target
*         machine, and the risk of overflowing IHMSF(4).  On some
*         architectures, for DAYS up to 1.0, the available floating-
*         point precision corresponds roughly to NDP=3.  This is well
*         below the ultimate limit of NDP=9 set by the capacity of a
*         typical 32-bit IHMSF(4).
*
*     3)  The absolute value of DAYS may exceed 1.0.  In cases where it
*         does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
*         case where DAYS is very nearly 1.0 and rounds up to 24 hours,
*         by testing for IHMSF(1)=24 and setting IHMSF(1-4) to zero.
