*  From the W and V matrices from the SVD factorisation of a matrix
*  (as obtained from the slSVD routine), obtain the covariance matrix.
*
*  (double precision)
*
*  Given:
*     N      i         number of rows and columns in matrices W and V
*     NP     i         first dimension of array containing matrix V
*     NC     i         first dimension of array to receive CVM
*     W      d(N)      NxN diagonal matrix W (diagonal elements only)
*     V      d(NP,NP)  array containing NxN orthogonal matrix V
*
*  Returned:
*     WORK   d(N)      workspace
*     CVM    d(NC,NC)  array to receive covariance matrix
