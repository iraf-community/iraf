      SUBROUTINE slDDTF (NDP, DAYS, SIGN, IHMSF)

*      D D T F

*
*  Convert an interval in days into hours, minutes, seconds
*  (double precision)
*
*  Given:
*     NDP      i      number of decimal places of seconds
*     DAYS     d      interval in days
*
*  Returned:
*     SIGN     c      '+' or '-'
*     IHMSF    i(4)   hours, minutes, seconds, fraction
*
*  Notes:
*
*     1)  NDP less than zero is interpreted as zero.
*
*     2)  The largest useful value for NDP is determined by the size
*         of DAYS, the format of DOUBLE PRECISION floating-point numbers
*         on the target machine, and the risk of overflowing IHMSF(4).
*         On some architectures, for DAYS up to 1D0, the available
*         floating-point precision corresponds roughly to NDP=12.
*         However, the practical limit is NDP=9, set by the capacity of
*         a typical 32-bit IHMSF(4).
*
*     3)  The absolute value of DAYS may exceed 1D0.  In cases where it
*         does not, it is up to the caller to test for and handle the
*         case where DAYS is very nearly 1D0 and rounds up to 24 hours,
*         by testing for IHMSF(1)=24 and setting IHMSF(1-4) to zero.
