*  Given:
*     TDK       d       ambient temperature, K
*     PMB       d       ambient pressure, millibars
*     RH        d       ambient relative humidity, 0-1
*     WL1       d       reference wavelength, micrometre (0.4D0 recommended)
*     A1        d       refraction coefficient A for wavelength WL1 (radians)
*     B1        d       refraction coefficient B for wavelength WL1 (radians)
*     WL2       d       wavelength for which adjusted A,B required
*
*  Returned:
*     A2        d       refraction coefficient A for wavelength WL2 (radians)
*     B2        d       refraction coefficient B for wavelength WL2 (radians)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1  To use this routine, first call slRFCO specifying WL1 as the
*     wavelength.  This yields refraction coefficients A1,B1, correct
*     for that wavelength.  Subsequently, calls to slATMD specifying
*     different wavelengths will produce new, slightly adjusted
*     refraction coefficients which apply to the specified wavelength.
*
*  2  Most of the atmospheric dispersion happens between 0.7 micrometre
*     and the UV atmospheric cutoff, and the effect increases strongly
*     towards the UV end.  For this reason a blue reference wavelength
*     is recommended, for example 0.4 micrometres.
*
*  3  The accuracy, for this set of conditions:
*
*        height above sea level    2000 m
*                      latitude    29 deg
*                      pressure    793 mb
*                   temperature    17 degC
*                      humidity    50%
*                    lapse rate    0.0065 degC/m
*          reference wavelength    0.4 micrometre
*                star elevation    15 deg
*
*     is about 2.5 mas RMS between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometres, and stays
*     within 4 mas for the whole range longward of 0.3 micrometres
*     (compared with a total dispersion from 0.3 to 20.0 micrometres
*     of about 11 arcsec).  These errors are typical for ordinary
*     conditions and the given elevation;  in extreme conditions values
*     a few times this size may occur, while at higher elevations the
*     errors become much smaller.
*
*  4  If either wavelength exceeds 100 micrometres, the radio case
*     is assumed and the returned refraction coefficients are the
*     same as the given ones.  Note that radio refraction coefficients
*     cannot be turned into optical values using this routine, nor
*     vice versa.
*
*  5  The algorithm consists of calculation of the refractivity of the
*     air at the observer for the two wavelengths, using the methods
*     of the slRFRO routine, and then scaling of the two refraction
*     coefficients according to classical refraction theory.  This
*     amounts to scaling the A coefficient in proportion to (n-1) and
*     the B coefficient almost in the same ratio (see R.M.Green,
*     "Spherical Astronomy", Cambridge University Press, 1985).
