*
*  Bearing (position angle) of one point on a sphere relative to another
*  (double precision)
*
*  Given:
*     A1,B1    d    spherical coordinates of one point
*     A2,B2    d    spherical coordinates of the other point
*
*  (The spherical coordinates are RA,Dec, Long,Lat etc, in radians.)
*
*  The result is the bearing (position angle), in radians, of point
*  A2,B2 as seen from point A1,B1.  It is in the range +/- pi.  If
*  A2,B2 is due east of A1,B1 the bearing is +pi/2.  Zero is returned
*  if the two points are coincident.
