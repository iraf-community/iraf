*
*  Spherical coordinates to direction cosines (single precision)
*
*  Given:
*     A,B      real      spherical coordinates in radians
*                           (RA,Dec), (long,lat) etc.
*
*  Returned:
*     V        real(3)   x,y,z unit vector
*
*  The spherical coordinates are longitude (+ve anticlockwise looking
*  from the +ve latitude pole) and latitude.  The Cartesian coordinates
*  are right handed, with the x axis at zero longitude and latitude, and
*  the z axis at the +ve latitude pole.
