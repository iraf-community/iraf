      SUBROUTINE slREFZ (ZU, REFA, REFB, ZR)

*
*  Adjust an unrefracted zenith distance to include the effect of
*  atmospheric refraction, using the simple A tan Z + B tan**3 Z
*  model (plus special handling for large ZDs).
*
*  Given:
*    ZU    dp    unrefracted zenith distance of the source (radian)
*    REFA  dp    tan Z coefficient (radian)
*    REFB  dp    tan**3 Z coefficient (radian)
*
*  Returned:
*    ZR    dp    refracted zenith distance (radian)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1  This routine applies the adjustment for refraction in the
*     opposite sense to the usual one - it takes an unrefracted
*     (in vacuo) position and produces an observed (refracted)
*     position, whereas the A tan Z + B tan**3 Z model strictly
*     applies to the case where an observed position is to have the
*     refraction removed.  The unrefracted to refracted case is
*     harder, and requires an inverted form of the text-book
*     refraction models;  the formula used here is based on the
*     Newton-Raphson method.  For the utmost numerical consistency
*     with the refracted to unrefracted model, two iterations are
*     carried out, achieving agreement at the 1D-11 arcseconds level
*     for a ZD of 80 degrees.  The inherent accuracy of the model
*     is, of course, far worse than this - see the documentation for
*     slRFCO for more information.
*
*  2  At ZD 83 degrees, the rapidly-worsening A tan Z + B tan**3 Z
*     model is abandoned and an empirical formula takes over.  Over a
*     wide range of observer heights and corresponding temperatures and
*     pressures, the following levels of accuracy (arcsec) are
*     typically achieved, relative to numerical integration through a
*     model atmosphere:
*
*              ZR    error
*
*              80      0.4
*              81      0.8
*              82      1.5
*              83      3.2
*              84      4.9
*              85      5.8
*              86      6.1
*              87      7.1
*              88     10
*              89     20
*              90     40
*              91    100         } relevant only to
*              92    200         } high-elevation sites
*
*     The high-ZD model is scaled to match the normal model at the
*     transition point;  there is no glitch.
*
*  3  Beyond 93 deg zenith distance, the refraction is held at its
*     93 deg value.
*
*  4  See also the routine slREFV, which performs the adjustment in
*     Cartesian Az/El coordinates, and with the emphasis on speed
*     rather than numerical accuracy.
