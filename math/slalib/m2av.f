      SUBROUTINE slM2AV (RMAT, AXVEC)

*
*  From a rotation matrix, determine the corresponding axial vector
*  (single precision)
*
*  A rotation matrix describes a rotation about some arbitrary axis,
*  called the Euler axis.  The "axial vector" returned by this routine
*  has the same direction as the Euler axis, and its magnitude is the
*  amount of rotation in radians.  (The magnitude and direction can be
*  separated by means of the routine slVN.)
*
*  Given:
*    RMAT   r(3,3)   rotation matrix
*
*  Returned:
*    AXVEC  r(3)     axial vector (radians)
*
*  The reference frame rotates clockwise as seen looking along
*  the axial vector from the origin.
*
*  If RMAT is null, so is the result.
