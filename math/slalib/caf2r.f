      SUBROUTINE slCAFR (IDEG, IAMIN, ASEC, RAD, J)
*+
*     - - - - - -
*      C A F R
*     - - - - - -
*
*  Convert degrees, arcminutes, arcseconds to radians
*  (single precision)
*
*  Given:
*     IDEG        int       degrees
*     IAMIN       int       arcminutes
*     ASEC        real      arcseconds
*
*  Returned:
*     RAD         real      angle in radians
*     J           int       status:  0 = OK
*                                    1 = IDEG outside range 0-359
*                                    2 = IAMIN outside range 0-59
*                                    3 = ASEC outside range 0-59.999...
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  The result is computed even if any of the range checks
*      fail.
*
*  2)  The sign must be dealt with outside this routine.
