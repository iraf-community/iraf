      SUBROUTINE slIMXV (RM, VA, VB)
*+
*     - - - - -
*      I M X V
*     - - - - -
*
*  Performs the 3-D backward unitary transformation:
*
*     vector VB = (inverse of matrix RM) * vector VA
*
*  (single precision)
*
*  (n.b.  the matrix must be unitary, as this routine assumes that
*   the inverse and transpose are identical)
*
*  Given:
*     RM       real(3,3)    matrix
*     VA       real(3)      vector
*
*  Returned:
*     VB       real(3)      result vector
