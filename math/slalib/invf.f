      SUBROUTINE slINVF (FWDS,BKWDS,J)

*
*  Invert a linear model of the type produced by the slFTXY routine.
*
*  Given:
*     FWDS    d(6)      model coefficients
*
*  Returned:
*     BKWDS   d(6)      inverse model
*     J        i        status:  0 = OK, -1 = no inverse
*
*  The models relate two sets of [X,Y] coordinates as follows.
*  Naming the elements of FWDS:
*
*     FWDS(1) = A
*     FWDS(2) = B
*     FWDS(3) = C
*     FWDS(4) = D
*     FWDS(5) = E
*     FWDS(6) = F
*
*  where two sets of coordinates [X1,Y1] and [X2,Y1] are related
*  thus:
*
*     X2 = A + B*X1 + C*Y1
*     Y2 = D + E*X1 + F*Y1
*
*  the present routine generates a new set of coefficients:
*
*     BKWDS(1) = P
*     BKWDS(2) = Q
*     BKWDS(3) = R
*     BKWDS(4) = S
*     BKWDS(5) = T
*     BKWDS(6) = U
*
*  such that:
*
*     X1 = P + Q*X2 + R*Y2
*     Y1 = S + T*X2 + U*Y2
*
*  Two successive calls to slINVF will thus deliver a set
*  of coefficients equal to the starting values.
*
*  To comply with the ANSI Fortran standard, FWDS and BKWDS must
*  not be the same array, even though the routine is coded to
*  work on many platforms even if this rule is violated.
