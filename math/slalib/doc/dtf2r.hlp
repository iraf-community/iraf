     - - - - - -

  Convert hours, minutes, seconds to radians (double precision)

  Given:
     IHOUR       int       hours
     IMIN        int       minutes
     SEC         dp        seconds

  Returned:
     RAD         dp        angle in radians
     J           int       status:  0 = OK
                                    1 = IHOUR outside range 0-23
                                    2 = IMIN outside range 0-59
                                    3 = SEC outside range 0-59.999...

  Called:
     slDTFD

  Notes:

     1)  The result is computed even if any of the range checks fail.

     2)  The sign must be dealt with outside this routine.
