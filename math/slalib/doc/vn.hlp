     - - -
      V N
     - - -

  Normalizes a 3-vector also giving the modulus (single precision)

  Given:
     V       real(3)      vector

  Returned:
     UV      real(3)      unit vector in direction of V
     VM      real         modulus of V

  If the modulus of V is zero, UV is set to zero as well
