      SUBROUTINE slMXM (A, B, C)

     - - - -
      M X M
     - - - -

  Product of two 3x3 matrices:
      matrix C  =  matrix A  x  matrix B

  (single precision)

  Given:
      A      real(3,3)        matrix
      B      real(3,3)        matrix

  Returned:
      C      real(3,3)        matrix result

  To comply with the ANSI Fortran 77 standard, A, B and C must
  be different arrays.  However, the routine is coded so as to
  work properly on the VAX and many other systems even if this
  rule is violated.
