     - - - - - - -
      P L N T
     - - - - - - -

  Approximate heliocentric position and velocity of a specified
  major planet (Mercury, Venus, EMB, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus
  or Neptune).

  Given:
     DATE      d      Modified Julian Date (JD - 2400000.5)
     NP        i      planet (1=Mercury, 2=Venus, 3=EMB ... 8=Neptune)

  Returned:
     PV        d(6)   heliocentric x,y,z,xdot,ydot,zdot, J2000
                                           equatorial triad (AU,AU/s)
     JSTAT     i      status: -1 = illegal NP (outside 1-8)
                               0 = OK
                              +1 = warning: date outside 1000-3000
                              +2 = warning: solution didn't converge

  Notes

  1  The epoch, DATE, is in the TDB timescale and is a Modified
     Julian Date (JD-2400000.5).

  2  The reference frame is equatorial and is with respect to the
     mean equinox and ecliptic of epoch J2000.

  3  If an NP value outside the range 1-8 is supplied, an error
     status (JSTAT = -1) is returned and the PV vector set to zeroes.

  4  The algorithm is due to J.L. Simon, P. Bretagnon, J. Chapront,
     M. Chapront-Touze, G. Francou and J. Laskar (Bureau des
     Longitudes, Paris, France).

  5  Comparisons of the present routine with the JPL DE200 ephemeris
     give the following RMS errors over the interval 1960-2025:

                      position (km)     speed (metre/sec)

        Mercury            334               0.437
        Venus             1060               0.855
        EMB               2010               0.815
        Mars              7690               1.98
        Jupiter          71700               7.70
        Saturn          199000              19.4
        Uranus          564000              16.4
        Neptune         158000              14.4

     From comparisons with DE102, Simon et al quote the following
     longitude accuracies over the interval 1800-2200:

        Mercury                 4"
        Venus                   5"
        EMB                     6"
        Mars                   17"
        Jupiter                71"
        Saturn                 81"
        Uranus                 86"
        Neptune                11"

     Over the interval 1000-3000, the accuracy is better than 1.5
     times that over 1800-2200.  Outside the interval 1000-3000 the
     accuracy declines.

  6  The present SLALIB implementation differs from the original
     Simon et al Fortran code in the following respects.  None of
     the changes affects the result significantly.

       *  The date is supplied as a Modified Julian Date rather
          than a Julian Date (MJD = JD - 2400000.5).

       *  The result is returned only in equatorial Cartesian form;
          the ecliptic longitude, latitude and radius vector are not
          returned.

       *  The result is in the J2000 equatorial frame, not ecliptic.

       *  The velocity is in AU per second, not AU per day.

       *  Everything is done in-line:  there are no calls to other
          routines.

       *  Different error/warning status values are used.

       *  A different Kepler's-equation-solver is used (avoiding
          use of COMPLEX*16).

       *  Polynomials in T are nested to minimize rounding errors.

       *  Explicit double-precision constants are used to avoid
          mixed-mode expressions.

       *  There are other, cosmetic, changes to comply with
          Starlink/SLALIB style guidelines.

  7  For NP=3 the result is for the Earth-Moon Barycentre.  To
     obtain the heliocentric position and velocity of the Earth,
     either use the SLALIB routine slEVP or call slDMON and
     subtract 0.012150581 times the geocentric Moon vector from
     the EMB vector produced by the present routine.  (The Moon
     vector should be precessed to J2000 first, but this can
     be omitted for modern epochs without introducing significant
     inaccuracy.)

  8  The status, JSTAT, indicates the most serious condition
     encountered, where illegal NP is considered the most serious,
     followed by failure to converge, then remote epoch.
