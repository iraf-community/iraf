  Given the direction cosines of a star and of the tangent point,
  determine the star's tangent-plane coordinates.

  (single precision)

  Given:
     V         r(3)    direction cosines of star
     V0        r(3)    direction cosines of tangent point

  Returned:
     XI,ETA    r       tangent plane coordinates of star
     J         i       status:   0 = OK
                                 1 = error, star too far from axis
                                 2 = error, antistar on tangent plane
                                 3 = error, antistar too far from axis

  Notes:

  1  If vector V0 is not of unit length, or if vector V is of zero
     length, the results will be wrong.

  2  If V0 points at a pole, the returned XI,ETA will be based on the
     arbitrary assumption that the RA of the tangent point is zero.

  3  This routine is the Cartesian equivalent of the routine slS2TP.
