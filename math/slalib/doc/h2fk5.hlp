  Transform Hipparcos star data into the FK5 (J2000) system.

  (double precision)

  This routine transforms Hipparcos star positions and proper
  motions into FK5 J2000.

  Given (all Hipparcos, epoch J2000):
     RH        d      RA (radians)
     DH        d      Dec (radians)
     DRH       d      proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
     DDH       d      proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)

  Returned (all FK5, equinox J2000, epoch J2000):
     R5        d      RA (radians)
     D5        d      Dec (radians)
     DR5       d      proper motion in RA (dRA/dt, rad/Jyear)
     DD5       d      proper motion in Dec (dDec/dt, rad/Jyear)

  Called:  slDSC6, slDAVM, slDMXV, slDIMV, slDVXV,
           slDC6S

  Notes:

  1)  The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
      cos(Dec)*dRA/dt, and are per year rather than per century.

  2)  The FK5 to Hipparcos transformation consists of a pure
      rotation and spin;  zonal errors in the FK5 catalogue are
      not taken into account.

  3)  The published orientation and spin components are interpreted
      as "axial vectors".  An axial vector points at the pole of the
      rotation and its length is the amount of rotation in radians.

  4)  See also slFK5H, slF5HZ, slHF5Z.
