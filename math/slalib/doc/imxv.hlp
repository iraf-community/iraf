      SUBROUTINE slIMXV (RM, VA, VB)

     - - - - -
      I M X V
     - - - - -

  Performs the 3-D backward unitary transformation:

     vector VB = (inverse of matrix RM) * vector VA

  (single precision)

  (n.b.  the matrix must be unitary, as this routine assumes that
   the inverse and transpose are identical)

  Given:
     RM       real(3,3)    matrix
     VA       real(3)      vector

  Returned:
     VB       real(3)      result vector
