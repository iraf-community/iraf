      SUBROUTINE slPCD (DISCO,X,Y)

  Apply pincushion/barrel distortion to a tangent-plane [x,y].

  Given:
     DISCO    d      pincushion/barrel distortion coefficient
     X,Y      d      tangent-plane coordinates

  Returned:
     X,Y      d      distorted coordinates

  Notes:

  1)  The distortion is of the form RP = R*(1 + C*R**2), where R is
      the radial distance from the tangent point, C is the DISCO
      argument, and RP is the radial distance in the presence of
      the distortion.

  2)  For pincushion distortion, C is +ve;  for barrel distortion,
      C is -ve.

  3)  For X,Y in units of one projection radius (in the case of
      a photographic plate, the focal length), the following
      DISCO values apply:

          Geometry          DISCO

          astrograph         0.0
          Schmidt           -0.3333
          AAT PF doublet  +147.069
          AAT PF triplet  +178.585
          AAT f/8          +21.20
          JKT f/8          +13.32

  4)  There is a companion routine, slUPCD, which performs
      an approximately inverse operation.
