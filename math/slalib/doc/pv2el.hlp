  Notes

  1  The PV 6-vector is with respect to the mean equator and equinox of
     epoch J2000.  The orbital elements produced are with respect to
     the J2000 ecliptic and mean equinox.

  2  The mass, PMASS, is important only for the larger planets.  For
     most purposes (e.g. asteroids) use 0D0.  Values less than zero
     are illegal.

  3  Three different element-format options are supported:

     Option JFORM=1, suitable for the major planets:

     EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
     ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
     ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
     PERIH  = longitude of perihelion, curly pi (radians)
     AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
     E      = eccentricity, e
     AORL   = mean longitude L (radians)
     DM     = daily motion (radians)

     Option JFORM=2, suitable for minor planets:

     EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
     ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
     ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
     PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
     AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
     E      = eccentricity, e
     AORL   = mean anomaly M (radians)

     Option JFORM=3, suitable for comets:

     EPOCH  = epoch of perihelion (TT MJD)
     ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
     ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
     PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
     AORQ   = perihelion distance, q (AU)
     E      = eccentricity, e

  4  It may not be possible to generate elements in the form
     requested through JFORMR.  The caller is notified of the form
     of elements actually returned by means of the JFORM argument:

      JFORMR   JFORM     meaning

        1        1       OK - elements are in the requested format
        1        2       never happens
        1        3       orbit not elliptical

        2        1       never happens
        2        2       OK - elements are in the requested format
        2        3       orbit not elliptical

        3        1       never happens
        3        2       never happens
        3        3       OK - elements are in the requested format

  5  The arguments returned for each value of JFORM (cf Note 5: JFORM
     may not be the same as JFORMR) are as follows:

         JFORM         1              2              3
         EPOCH         t0             t0             T
         ORBINC        i              i              i
         ANODE         Omega          Omega          Omega
         PERIH         curly pi       omega          omega
         AORQ          a              a              q
         E             e              e              e
         AORL          L              M              -
         DM            n              -              -

     where:

         t0           is the epoch of the elements (MJD, TT)
         T              "    epoch of perihelion (MJD, TT)
         i              "    inclination (radians)
         Omega          "    longitude of the ascending node (radians)
         curly pi       "    longitude of perihelion (radians)
         omega          "    argument of perihelion (radians)
         a              "    mean distance (AU)
         q              "    perihelion distance (AU)
         e              "    eccentricity
         L              "    longitude (radians, 0-2pi)
         M              "    mean anomaly (radians, 0-2pi)
         n              "    daily motion (radians)
         -             means no value is set

  6  At very small inclinations, the longitude of the ascending node
     ANODE becomes indeterminate and under some circumstances may be
     set arbitrarily to zero.  Similarly, if the orbit is close to
     circular, the true anomaly becomes indeterminate and under some
     circumstances may be set arbitrarily to zero.  In such cases,
     the other elements are automatically adjusted to compensate,
     and so the elements remain a valid description of the orbit.
