      SUBROUTINE slADET (RM, DM, EQ, RC, DC)

  Add the E-terms (elliptic component of annual aberration)
  to a pre IAU 1976 mean place to conform to the old
  catalogue convention (double precision)

  Given:
     RM,DM     dp     RA,Dec (radians) without E-terms
     EQ        dp     Besselian epoch of mean equator and equinox

  Returned:
     RC,DC     dp     RA,Dec (radians) with E-terms included

  Note:

     Most star positions from pre-1984 optical catalogues (or
     derived from astrometry using such stars) embody the
     E-terms.  If it is necessary to convert a formal mean
     place (for example a pulsar timing position) to one
     consistent with such a star catalogue, then the RA,Dec
     should be adjusted using this routine.

     section 2D, page 48.
