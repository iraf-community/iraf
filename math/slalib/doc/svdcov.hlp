  From the W and V matrices from the SVD factorisation of a matrix
  (as obtained from the slSVD routine), obtain the covariance matrix.

  (double precision)

  Given:
     N      i         number of rows and columns in matrices W and V
     NP     i         first dimension of array containing matrix V
     NC     i         first dimension of array to receive CVM
     W      d(N)      NxN diagonal matrix W (diagonal elements only)
     V      d(NP,NP)  array containing NxN orthogonal matrix V

  Returned:
     WORK   d(N)      workspace
     CVM    d(NC,NC)  array to receive covariance matrix
