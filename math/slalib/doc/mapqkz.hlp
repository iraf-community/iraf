      SUBROUTINE slMAPZ (RM, DM, AMPRMS, RA, DA)

  Quick mean to apparent place:  transform a star RA,Dec from
  mean place to geocentric apparent place, given the
  star-independent parameters, and assuming zero parallax
  and proper motion.

  Use of this routine is appropriate when efficiency is important
  and where many star positions, all with parallax and proper
  motion either zero or already allowed for, and all referred to
  the same equator and equinox, are to be transformed for one
  epoch.  The star-independent parameters can be obtained by
  calling the slMAPA routine.

  The corresponding routine for the case of non-zero parallax
  and proper motion is slMAPQ.

  The reference frames and timescales used are post IAU 1976.

  Given:
     RM,DM    d      mean RA,Dec (rad)
     AMPRMS   d(21)  star-independent mean-to-apparent parameters:

       (1-4)    not used
       (5-7)    heliocentric direction of the Earth (unit vector)
       (8)      (grav rad Sun)*2/(Sun-Earth distance)
       (9-11)   ABV: barycentric Earth velocity in units of c
       (12)     sqrt(1-v**2) where v=modulus(ABV)
       (13-21)  precession/nutation (3,3) matrix

  Returned:
     RA,DA    d      apparent RA,Dec (rad)

  Notes:

  1)  The vectors AMPRMS(2-4) and AMPRMS(5-7) are referred to the
      mean equinox and equator of epoch EQ.

  2)  Strictly speaking, the routine is not valid for solar-system
      sources, though the error will usually be extremely small.
      However, to prevent gross errors in the case where the
      position of the Sun is specified, the gravitational
      deflection term is restrained within about 920 arcsec of the
      centre of the Sun's disc.  The term has a maximum value of
      about 1.85 arcsec at this radius, and decreases to zero as
      the centre of the disc is approached.

  Called:  slDS2C, slDVDV, slDMXV, slDC2S, slDA2P
