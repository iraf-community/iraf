      REAL FUNCTION slRVER (PHI, RA, DA, ST)

     - - - - - - -
      R V E R

  Velocity component in a given direction due to Earth rotation
  (single precision)

  Given:
     PHI     real    latitude of observing station (geodetic)
     RA,DA   real    apparent RA,DEC
     ST      real    local apparent sidereal time

  PHI, RA, DEC and ST are all in radians.

  Result:
     Component of Earth rotation in direction RA,DA (km/s)

  Sign convention:
     The result is +ve when the observatory is receding from the
     given point on the sky.

  Accuracy:
     The simple algorithm used assumes a spherical Earth, of
     a radius chosen to give results accurate to about 0.0005 km/s
     for observing stations at typical latitudes and heights.  For
     applications requiring greater precision, use the routine
     slPVOB.
