      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION slEPCO (K0, K, E)

  Convert an epoch into the appropriate form - 'B' or 'J'

  Given:
     K0    char    form of result:  'B'=Besselian, 'J'=Julian
     K     char    form of given epoch:  'B' or 'J'
     E     dp      epoch

  Called:  slEPB, slEJ2D, slEPJ, slEB2D

  Notes:

     1) The result is always either equal to or very close to
        the given epoch E.  The routine is required only in
        applications where punctilious treatment of heterogeneous
        mixtures of star positions is necessary.

     2) K0 and K are not validated.  They are interpreted as follows:

        o  If K0 and K are the same the result is E.
        o  If K0 is 'B' or 'b' and K isn't, the conversion is J to B.
        o  In all other cases, the conversion is B to J.

        Note that K0 and K won't match if their cases differ.
