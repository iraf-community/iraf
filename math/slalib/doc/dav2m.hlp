  Form the rotation matrix corresponding to a given axial vector.
  (double precision)

  A rotation matrix describes a rotation about some arbitrary axis.
  The axis is called the Euler axis, and the angle through which the
  reference frame rotates is called the Euler angle.  The axial
  vector supplied to this routine has the same direction as the
  Euler axis, and its magnitude is the Euler angle in radians.

  Given:
    AXVEC  d(3)     axial vector (radians)

  Returned:
    RMAT   d(3,3)   rotation matrix

  If AXVEC is null, the unit matrix is returned.

  The reference frame rotates clockwise as seen looking along
  the axial vector from the origin.
