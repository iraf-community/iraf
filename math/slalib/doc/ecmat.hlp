  Form the equatorial to ecliptic rotation matrix - IAU 1980 theory
  (double precision)

  Given:
     DATE     dp         TDB (loosely ET) as Modified Julian Date
                                            (JD-2400000.5)
  Returned:
     RMAT     dp(3,3)    matrix

  Reference:
     Murray,C.A., Vectorial Astrometry, section 4.3.

  Note:
    The matrix is in the sense   V(ecl)  =  RMAT * V(equ);  the
    equator, equinox and ecliptic are mean of date.
