      SUBROUTINE slSUET (RC, DC, EQ, RM, DM)

  Remove the E-terms (elliptic component of annual aberration)
  from a pre IAU 1976 catalogue RA,Dec to give a mean place
  (double precision)

  Given:
     RC,DC     dp     RA,Dec (radians) with E-terms included
     EQ        dp     Besselian epoch of mean equator and equinox

  Returned:
     RM,DM     dp     RA,Dec (radians) without E-terms

  Called:
     slETRM, slDS2C, sla_,DVDV, slDC2S, slDA2P

  Explanation:
     Most star positions from pre-1984 optical catalogues (or
     derived from astrometry using such stars) embody the
     E-terms.  This routine converts such a position to a
     formal mean place (allowing, for example, comparison with a
     pulsar timing position).

     section 2D, page 48.
