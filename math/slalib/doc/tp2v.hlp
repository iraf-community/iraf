  Given the tangent-plane coordinates of a star and the direction
  cosines of the tangent point, determine the direction cosines
  of the star.

  (single precision)

  Given:
     XI,ETA    r       tangent plane coordinates of star
     V0        r(3)    direction cosines of tangent point

  Returned:
     V         r(3)    direction cosines of star

  Notes:

  1  If vector V0 is not of unit length, the returned vector V will
     be wrong.

  2  If vector V0 points at a pole, the returned vector V will be
     based on the arbitrary assumption that the RA of the tangent
     point is zero.

  3  This routine is the Cartesian equivalent of the routine slTP2S.
