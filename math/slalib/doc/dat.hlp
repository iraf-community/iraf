      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION slDAT (UTC)

     - - - -
      D A T
     - - - -

  Increment to be applied to Coordinated Universal Time UTC to give
  International Atomic Time TAI (double precision)

  Given:
     UTC      d      UTC date as a modified JD (JD-2400000.5)

  Result:  TAI-UTC in seconds

  Notes:

  1  The UTC is specified to be a date rather than a time to indicate
     that care needs to be taken not to specify an instant which lies
     within a leap second.  Though in most cases UTC can include the
     fractional part, correct behaviour on the day of a leap second
     can only be guaranteed up to the end of the second 23:59:59.

  2  Pre 1972 January 1 a fixed value of 10 sec is returned.
