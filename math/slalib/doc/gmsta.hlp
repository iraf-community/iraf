      DOUBLE PRECISION FUNCTION slGMSA (DATE, UT)

     - - - - - -

  Conversion from universal time to sidereal time with
  rounding errors minimized.

  double precision

  Given:
    DATE    d      UT1 date (MJD: integer part of JD-2400000.5))
    UT      d      UT1 time (fraction of a day)

  The result is the Greenwich mean sidereal time (double
  precision, radians).

  The algorithm is derived from the IAU 1982 expression (see page
  S15 of the 1984 Astronomical Almanac).

  There is no restriction on how the UT is apportioned between the
  DATE and UT arguments.  Either of the two arguments could, for
  example, be zero and the entire date+time supplied in the other.
  However, the routine is designed to deliver maximum accuracy when
  the DATE argument is a whole number and the UT lies in the range
  0 to 1.

  See also the routine slGMST, which accepts the UT as a single
  argument.  Compared with slGMST, the extra numerical precision
  delivered by the present routine is unlikely to be important in
  an absolute sense, but may be useful when critically comparing
  algorithms and in applications where two sidereal times close
  together are differenced.
