  Gregorian Calendar to Modified Julian Date

  Given:
     IY,IM,ID     int    year, month, day in Gregorian calendar

  Returned:
     DJM          dp     modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5) for 0 hrs
     J            int    status:
                           0 = OK
                           1 = bad year   (MJD not computed)
                           2 = bad month  (MJD not computed)
                           3 = bad day    (MJD computed)

  The year must be -4699 (i.e. 4700BC) or later.

  The algorithm is derived from that of Hatcher 1984
  (QJRAS 25, 53-55).
