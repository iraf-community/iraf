      SUBROUTINE slDBJI (STRING, NSTRT, DRESLT, J1, J2)

     - - - - - -
      D B J I
     - - - - - -

  Convert free-format input into double precision floating point,
  using DFLTIN but with special syntax extensions.

  The purpose of the syntax extensions is to help cope with mixed
  FK4 and FK5 data.  In addition to the syntax accepted by DFLTIN,
  the following two extensions are recognized by DBJIN:

     1)  A valid non-null field preceded by the character 'B'
         (or 'b') is accepted.

     2)  A valid non-null field preceded by the character 'J'
         (or 'j') is accepted.

  The calling program is notified of the incidence of either of these
  extensions through an supplementary status argument.  The rest of
  the arguments are as for DFLTIN.

  Given:
     STRING      char       string containing field to be decoded
     NSTRT       int        pointer to 1st character of field in string

  Returned:
     NSTRT       int        incremented
     DRESLT      double     result
     J1          int        DFLTIN status: -1 = -OK
                                            0 = +OK
                                           +1 = null field
                                           +2 = error
     J2          int        syntax flag:  0 = normal DFLTIN syntax
                                         +1 = 'B' or 'b'
                                         +2 = 'J' or 'j'

  Called:  slDFLI

  For details of the basic syntax, see slDFLI.
