  Transform star RA,Dec from mean place to geocentric apparent

  The reference frames and timescales used are post IAU 1976.

  Given:
     RM,DM    dp     mean RA,Dec (rad)
     PR,PD    dp     proper motions:  RA,Dec changes per Julian year
     PX       dp     parallax (arcsec)
     RV       dp     radial velocity (km/sec, +ve if receding)
     EQ       dp     epoch and equinox of star data (Julian)
     DATE     dp     TDB for apparent place (JD-2400000.5)

  Returned:
     RA,DA    dp     apparent RA,Dec (rad)

  Called:
     slMAPA       star-independent parameters
     slMAPQ       quick mean to apparent

  Notes:

  1)  EQ is the Julian epoch specifying both the reference
      frame and the epoch of the position - usually 2000.
      For positions where the epoch and equinox are
      different, use the routine slPM to apply proper
      motion corrections before using this routine.

  2)  The distinction between the required TDB and TT is
      always negligible.  Moreover, for all but the most
      critical applications UTC is adequate.

  3)  The proper motions in RA are dRA/dt rather than
      cos(Dec)*dRA/dt.

  4)  This routine may be wasteful for some applications
      because it recomputes the Earth position/velocity and
      the precession/nutation matrix each time, and because
      it allows for parallax and proper motion.  Where
      multiple transformations are to be carried out for one
      epoch, a faster method is to call the slMAPA routine
      once and then either the slMAPQ routine (which includes
      parallax and proper motion) or slMAPZ (which assumes
      zero parallax and proper motion).
