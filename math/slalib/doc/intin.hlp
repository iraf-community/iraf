  Convert free-format input into an integer

  Given:
     STRING     c     string containing number to be decoded
     NSTRT      i     pointer to where decoding is to start
     IRESLT     i     current value of result

  Returned:
     NSTRT      i      advanced to next number
     IRESLT     i      result
     JFLAG      i      status: -1 = -OK, 0 = +OK, 1 = null, 2 = error

  Called:  slICHI

  Notes:

     1     The reason INTIN has separate OK status values for +
           and - is to enable minus zero to be detected.   This is
           of crucial importance when decoding mixed-radix numbers.
           For example, an angle expressed as deg, arcmin, arcsec
           may have a leading minus sign but a zero degrees field.

     2     A TAB is interpreted as a space.

     3     The basic format is the sequence of fields #^, where
           # is a sign character + or -, and ^ means a string of
           decimal digits.

     4     Spaces:

             .  Leading spaces are ignored.

             .  Spaces between the sign and the number are allowed.

             .  Trailing spaces are ignored;  the first signifies
                end of decoding and subsequent ones are skipped.

     5     Delimiters:

             .  Any character other than +,-,0-9 or space may be
                used to signal the end of the number and terminate
                decoding.

             .  Comma is recognized by INTIN as a special case;  it
                is skipped, leaving the pointer on the next character.
                See 9, below.

     6     The sign is optional.  The default is +.

     7     A "null result" occurs when the string of characters being
           decoded does not begin with +,- or 0-9, or consists
           entirely of spaces.  When this condition is detected, JFLAG
           is set to 1 and IRESLT is left untouched.

     8     NSTRT = 1 for the first character in the string.

     9     On return from INTIN, NSTRT is set ready for the next
           decode - following trailing blanks and any comma.  If a
           delimiter other than comma is being used, NSTRT must be
           incremented before the next call to INTIN, otherwise
           all subsequent calls will return a null result.

     10    Errors (JFLAG=2) occur when:

             .  there is a + or - but no number;  or

             .  the number is greater than BIG (defined below).

     11    When an error has been detected, NSTRT is left
           pointing to the character following the last
           one used before the error came to light.
