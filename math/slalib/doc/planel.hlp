  Notes

  1  DATE is the instant for which the prediction is required.  It is
     in the TT timescale (formerly Ephemeris Time, ET) and is a
     Modified Julian Date (JD-2400000.5).

  2  The elements are with respect to the J2000 ecliptic and equinox.

  3  Three different element-format options are available:

     Option JFORM=1, suitable for the major planets:

     EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
     ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
     ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
     PERIH  = longitude of perihelion, curly pi (radians)
     AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
     E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
     AORL   = mean longitude L (radians)
     DM     = daily motion (radians)

     Option JFORM=2, suitable for minor planets:

     EPOCH  = epoch of elements (TT MJD)
     ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
     ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
     PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
     AORQ   = mean distance, a (AU)
     E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to <1)
     AORL   = mean anomaly M (radians)

     Option JFORM=3, suitable for comets:

     EPOCH  = epoch of perihelion (TT MJD)
     ORBINC = inclination i (radians)
     ANODE  = longitude of the ascending node, big omega (radians)
     PERIH  = argument of perihelion, little omega (radians)
     AORQ   = perihelion distance, q (AU)
     E      = eccentricity, e (range 0 to 10)

  4  Unused elements (DM for JFORM=2, AORL and DM for JFORM=3) are
     not accessed.

  5  The reference frame for the result is with respect to the mean
     equator and equinox of epoch J2000.

  6  The algorithm was originally adapted from the EPHSLA program of
     D.H.P.Jones (private communication, 1996).  The method is based
     on Stumpff's Universal Variables.
