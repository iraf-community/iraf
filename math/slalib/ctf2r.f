      SUBROUTINE slCTFR (IHOUR, IMIN, SEC, RAD, J)
*+
*     - - - - - -
*      C T F R
*     - - - - - -
*
*  Convert hours, minutes, seconds to radians (single precision)
*
*  Given:
*     IHOUR       int       hours
*     IMIN        int       minutes
*     SEC         real      seconds
*
*  Returned:
*     RAD         real      angle in radians
*     J           int       status:  0 = OK
*                                    1 = IHOUR outside range 0-23
*                                    2 = IMIN outside range 0-59
*                                    3 = SEC outside range 0-59.999...
*
*  Called:
*     slCTFD
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  The result is computed even if any of the range checks
*      fail.
*
*  2)  The sign must be dealt with outside this routine.
