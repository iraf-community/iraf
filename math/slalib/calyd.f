*
*  Gregorian calendar date to year and day in year (in a Julian
*  calendar aligned to the 20th/21st century Gregorian calendar).
*
*  (Includes century default feature:  use slCLYD for years
*   before 100AD.)
*
*  Given:
*     IY,IM,ID   int    year, month, day in Gregorian calendar
*                       (year may optionally omit the century)
*  Returned:
*     NY         int    year (re-aligned Julian calendar)
*     ND         int    day in year (1 = January 1st)
*     J          int    status:
*                         0 = OK
*                         1 = bad year (before -4711)
*                         2 = bad month
*                         3 = bad day (but conversion performed)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1  This routine exists to support the low-precision routines
*     slERTH, slMOON and slECOR.
*
*  2  Between 1900 March 1 and 2100 February 28 it returns answers
*     which are consistent with the ordinary Gregorian calendar.
*     Outside this range there will be a discrepancy which increases
*     by one day for every non-leap century year.
*
*  3  Years in the range 50-99 are interpreted as 1950-1999, and
*     years in the range 00-49 are interpreted as 2000-2049.
