*
*  Convert geodetic position to geocentric (double precision)
*
*  Given:
*     P     dp     latitude (geodetic, radians)
*     H     dp     height above reference spheroid (geodetic, metres)
*
*  Returned:
*     R     dp     distance from Earth axis (AU)
*     Z     dp     distance from plane of Earth equator (AU)
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1  Geocentric latitude can be obtained by evaluating ATAN2(Z,R).
*
*  2  IAU 1976 constants are used.
