*  Air mass at given zenith distance (double precision)
*
*  Given:
*     ZD     d     Observed zenith distance (radians)
*
*  The result is an estimate of the air mass, in units of that
*  at the zenith.
*
*  Notes:
*
*  1)  The "observed" zenith distance referred to above means "as
*      affected by refraction".
*
*  2)  Uses Hardie's (1962) polynomial fit to Bemporad's data for
*      the relative air mass, X, in units of thickness at the zenith
*      as tabulated by Schoenberg (1929). This is adequate for all
*      normal needs as it is accurate to better than 0.1% up to X =
*      6.8 and better than 1% up to X = 10. Bemporad's tabulated
*      values are unlikely to be trustworthy to such accuracy
*      because of variations in density, pressure and other
*      conditions in the atmosphere from those assumed in his work.
*
*  3)  The sign of the ZD is ignored.
*
*  4)  At zenith distances greater than about ZD = 87 degrees the
*      air mass is held constant to avoid arithmetic overflows.
