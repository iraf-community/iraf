math$iminterp/msigrl.x: Davis, Feb 8, 1989
    1. There was a bug in the shift and wrap routines in the 2D routine
    which integrates in polygonal apertures. If the vertices of the
    polygon  were listed in certain orders the routine would produce
    wrong results. The routine has been totally rewritten to use
    the polygon clipping code in polyphot.

math$interp/asigrl.x: Davis, Jan 27, 1988
    1. The routine ii_getpcoeff was duplicated in the files asigrl.x and
    ii_1dinteg.x. I removed the copy in asigrl.x and rebuilt the library.

math$interp/arider.x: Davis, February 10, 1988
    1. The routines iidr_poly3, iidr_poly5 and iidr_spine3 were declared
    as functions but called everywhere as subroutines. I removed the
    function declarations.

math$gsurfit/gsder.gx: Davis, October 16, 1987
    1. changed a real type conversion call to double in the gsder routine.
    This error was causing the derivative evaluations to fail on the sun.

math$gsurfit/gsder.gx: Davis, August 11, 1987
    1. A call in gsder to gscoeff was not being set to double precision.

math$gsurfit: Davis, January 22, 1986
    1. A new version of the gsurfit package was installed. A double precision
    gsurfit has  been added. The double precision calls are the same as
    the single precision calls but prefixed by a d. Some of the evaluation
    routines were vectorized and run significantly faster than the old version.
    A power series polynomial function was added to the package for convenience
    in evaluating the simple rotation transformation functions.

math$iminterp/arider.x: Davis, September 7, 1986
    1. The routines ii_pcpoly3, ii_pcpoly5 and ii_pcspline3 were declared
    as functions but called everywhere as subroutines. Removed the function
    declaration. I also moved these routines into a file of their own
    ii_pc1deval.x and changed the prefix to ia_ from ii_ to avoid conflict
    with the 2D equivalents.

math$interp/arider.x: Davis, September 7, 1986
    1. The routines ii_pcpoly3, ii_pcpoly5 and ii_pcspline3 were declared
    as functions but called everywhere as subroutines. Removed the function
    declaration.

From Davis Jan 8, 1986

1. Added documentation for surfit package.
