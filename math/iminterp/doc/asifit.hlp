NAME
asifit - fit the interpolant to data
.ih
SYNOPSIS
asifit (asi, datain, npix)

.nf
    pointer	asi		#I interpolant descriptor
    real	datain[npix]	#I input data
    int		npix		#I the number of data points
.fi

ARGUMENTS
.ls asi   
Pointer to sequential interpolant descriptor structure.
.le
.ls datain
Array of input data.
.le
.ls npix    
Number of data points.

DESCRIPTION
The datain array is checked for size, memory is allocated for the coefficient
array, and the end conditions are specified.  The interior polynomial, sinc and
drizzle interpolants are saved as the data points. The polynomial coefficients
are calculated directly from the data points in the evaluation stage. The
B-spline coefficients are calculated in ASIFIT as they depend on the entire
data array.

NOTES
Checking for INDEF valued and out of bounds pixels is the responsibility
of the user. ASIINIT or ASISINIT and ASIFIT must be called before using
ASIEVAL, ASIVECTOR, ASIDER or ASIGRL.
