NAME
asifit - fit the interpolant to data
.ih
SYNOPSIS
asifit (asi, datain, npix)

.nf
    pointer	asi		# interpolant descriptor
    real	datain[npix]	# input data
    int		npix		# the number of data points
.fi

ARGUMENTS
.ls asi   
Pointer to sequential interpolant descriptor structure.
.le
.ls datain
Array of input data.
.le
.ls npix    
Number of data points.

DESCRIPTION
The datain array is checked for size, memory is allocated for the coefficient
array and the end conditions are specified.
The interior polynomial interpolants are saved as the data points. The
polynomial coefficients are calculated directly from the data points in
the evaluation
stage. The B-spline coefficients are calculated in ASIFIT as they depend
on the entire data array.  The sinc interpolation type simple stores
the data points.

NOTES
Checking for INDEF valued and out of bounds pixels is the responsibility
of the user.
ASIINIT and ASIFIT must be called before using ASIEVAL, ASIVECTOR, ASIDER or
ASIGRL.
