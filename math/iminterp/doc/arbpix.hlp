NAME
arbpix -- replace INDEF valued pixels with interpolated values
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/iminterp.h>

arbpix (datain, dataout, npix, interp_type, boundary_type)

.nf
    real	datain[npix]	# input data
    real	dataout[npix]	# output array, dataout != datain
    int		npix		# number of data points
    int		interp_type	# type of interpolant
    int		boundary_type	# type of boundary condition

ARGUMENTS
.ls datain
Array of data containing 0 or more INDEF valued pixels.
.le
.ls dataout
Array of data with INDEFS replaced by interpolated values.
The dataout array must be different from the datain array.
.le
.ls npix   
Number of data points.
.le
.ls interp_type
Type of interpolant. Options are II_NEAREST, II_LINEAR, II_POLY3, II_POLY5,
II_SPLINE3 and II_SINC. The interpolant type definitions are contained in
the file math/iminterp.h.
.le
.ls boundary_type
Type of boundary condition. The only boundary option at present is
II_BOUNDARY_PROJECTION.
The boundary type definitions are contained in the header file
math/iminterp.h.

DESCRIPTION
If there are no good points in datain, ARBPIX returns INDEFS in dataout.
At present the only permitted boundary extension algorithm is
boundary projection. Points below and above the first and last good point
are replaced by the first and last good point values respectively.
.ih
NOTES
The SINC function actually evaluates the interpolant by computing the
average of two interpolations at +-0.05 pixels about the bad pixel since
the interpolant is undefined exactly at a pixel.
