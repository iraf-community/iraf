NAME
msifit - fit the interpolant to the data
.ih
SYNOPSIS
msifit (msi, datain, nxpix, nypix, len_datain)

.nf
    pointer	msi			#I interpolant descriptor
    real	datain[len_datain,ARB]	#I data array
    int		nxpix			#I number of x pixels
    int		nypix			#I number of y pixels
    int		len_datain		#I length of datain, len_datain >= nxpix

ARGUMENTS
.ls msi     
Pointer to the sequential interpolant descriptor.
.le
.ls datain
Array containing the data.
.le
.ls nxpix, nypix
The number of pixels in x and y.
.le
.ls len_datain
The row length of the datain array. Len_datain must be >= nxpix.

DESCRIPTION
The datain array is checked for size, memory is allocated for the coefficient
array and the end conditions are specified. The interior polynomial, sinc,
and drizzle interpolants are saved as the data points. The polynomial
coefficients are calculated from the data points in the evaluation stage.
The B-spline coefficients are calculated in MSIFIT as they depend on the
entire data array.

NOTES
Checking for INDEF valued pixels is the responsibility of the user.
MSIINIT or MSISINIT must be called before using MSIFIT.  MSIFIT must be
called before using MSIEVAL, MSIVECTOR, MSIDER, MSIGRL or MSISQGRL.
