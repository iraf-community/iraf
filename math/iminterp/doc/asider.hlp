NAME
asider -- evaluate the interpolant derivatives at x
.ih
SYNOPSIS
asider (asi, x, der, nder)

.nf
    pointer	asi	# interpolant descriptor
    real	x	# x value, 1 <= x <= npix
    real	der[]	# der[1] = interpolant, der[2] = 1st derivative
    int		nder	# number of derivatives 
.fi
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls asi   
Pointer to the sequential interpolant descriptor.
.le
.ls x   
X value.
.le
.ls der  
Array containing the derivatives. Der[1] = interpolant at x, der[2] the
first derivative of the interpolant at x and so on.
.le
.ls nder
Number of derivatives. Nder = 1 + order of the maximum desired derivative.
ASIDER checks that nder is reasonable.  Only the function value and
first two derivatives are provided for the SINC interpolant.

DESCRIPTION
The polynomial coefficients are evaluated directly from the data  points
in the case of the polynomial interpolants and from the B-spline coefficients
in the case of the bicubic spline. The derivatives are evaluated from
the polynomial coefficients using nested multiplication.  The sinc
derivatives are analytic but are defined only for the first two derivatives.

NOTES
ASIDER checks that the number of derivatives requested is reasonable.
Checking for out of bounds and INDEF valued pixels is the
responsibility of the user. ASIINIT and ASIFIT must be called before using
ASIDER.
