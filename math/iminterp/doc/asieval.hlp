NAME
asieval -- procedure to evaluate interpolant at x
.ih
SYNOPSIS
y = asieval (asi, x)

.nf
    pointer	asi	# interpolant descriptor
    real	x	# x value, 1 <= x <= npts
.fi
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls asi   
Pointer to the sequential interpolant descriptor structure.
.le
.ls x    
X value.

DESCRIPTION
The polynomial coefficients are calculated directly from the data points
or the B-spline coefficients. The
actual calculation is done by adding and multiplying terms
according to Everett's central difference interpolation formula.

The sinc interpolation is computed using a range of data points around
the desired position.

NOTES
Checking for out of bounds and INDEF valued pixels is the
responsibility of the user. ASIINIT and ASIFIT must be called before using
ASIEVAL.
