NAME
cvset -- input fit parameters derived external to CURFIT
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/curfit.h>

cvset (cv, curve_type, xmin, xmax, coeff, ncoeff)

.nf
pointer	cv		# pointer to curve descriptor
int	curve_type	# functional form of the curve to be fitted
real	xmin, xmax	# minimum and maximum x values
real	coeff[ncoeff]	# coefficient array
int	ncoeff		# number of coefficients

ARGUMENTS
.ls cv    
Pointer to curve descriptor structure. Returned by CVSET.
.le
.ls curve_type
Type of curve to be input. Must be one of LEGENDRE, CHEBYSHEV, SPLINE3
or SPLINE1.
.le
.ls xmin, xmax
The minimum and maximum data or fitted x values. The Legendre and
Chebyshev polynomials are assumed to be normalized over this range.
For the cubic and linear spline functions, the data range (xmax - xmin) is
divided into (ncoeff - 3) and (ncoeff - 1) evenly spaced polynomial pieces
respectively.
.le
.ls coeff
Array containing the coefficients. Must have at least 7 + order
elements, where order has the same meaning as the order parameter set in CVINIT.
.le
.ls ncoeff
The number of coefficients. For polynomial functions, ncoeff
equals 1 plus the order of the polynomial, e.g. a second order
polynomial curve will have three coefficients. For the cubic
and linear spline the number of polynomial pieces fit are
(ncoeff - 3) and (ncoeff - 1) respectively.

DESCRIPTION
CVSET returns cv the pointer to the curve descriptor and
stores the curve parameters  in the CURFIT structure ready for
use by CVEVAL or CVVECTOR.
.ih
NOTES
The splines are assumed to have been fit in the least squares sense.
