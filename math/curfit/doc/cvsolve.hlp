NAME
cvsolve -- solve a linear system of eqns by the Cholesky method
.ih
SYNOPSIS
cvsolve (cv, ier)

.nf
pointer	cv	# curve descriptor
int	ier	# error code
.fi
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls cv    
Pointer to the curve descriptor
.le
.ls ier    
Error code returned by the fitting routines. The options are
OK, SINGULAR and NO_DEG_FREEDOM. If ier is SINGULAR the matrix is singular,
CVSOLVE will compute a solution to the normal equationsbut one or more of the
coefficients will be zero.
If ier equals NO_DEG_FREEDOM, too few data points exist for a reasonable
solution to be computed. CVSOLVE returns
without fitting the data.

DESCRIPTION
CVSOLVE call two routines CVCHOFAC and CVCHOSLV. CVCHOFAC computes the
Cholesky factorization of the data matrix. CVCHOSLV solves for the
coefficients of the fitting function by forward and back substitution.
An error code is returned by CVSOLVE if it is unable to solve the normal
equations as formulated.
