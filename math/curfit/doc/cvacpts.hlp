cvacpts -- fit a curve to a set of data values

SYNOPSIS
cvacpts (cv, x, y, weight, npts, wtflag)

.nf
pointer	cv		# curve descriptor
real	x[]		# array of x values
real	y[]		# array of y values
real	weight[]	# array of weights
int	npts		# number of data points
int	wtflag		# type of weighting

ARGUMENTS
.ls cv    
Pointer to the curve descriptor structure.
.le
.ls x    
Array of x values.
.le
.ls y
Array of y values
.le
.ls weight
Array of weights
.le
.ls wtflag
Type of weighting. The options are WTS_USER, WTS_SPACING and
WTS_UNIFORM. If wtflag = WTS_USER individual weights for each data point
are supplied by the calling program and points with zero-valued weights are
not included in the fit. If wtflag = WTS_UNIFORM, all weights are assigned
values of 1. If wtflag = WTS_SPACING, the weights are set equal to the
difference between adjacent data points. In order to correctly use the
WTS_SPACING option the data must be sorted in x.

DESCRIPTION
CVACPTS zeroes the matrix and vectors, calculates the non-zero basis functions,
calculates the contribution
of each data point to the normal equations and accumulates it into the
appropriate array and vector elements.

NOTES
Checking for out of bounds x values is the responsibility of the user.
