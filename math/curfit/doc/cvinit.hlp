NAME
cvinit -- initialise curve descriptor
.ih
SYNOPSIS
include <math/curfit.h>

cvinit (cv, curve_type, order, xmin, xmax)

.nf
pointer		cv		# curve descriptor
int		curve_type	# the fitting function
int		order		# order of the fit
real		xmin		# minimum x value
real		xmax		# maximum x value
.fi

ARGUMENTS
.ls cv      
Pointer to the curve descriptor structure.
.le
.ls curve_type
Fitting function.
Permitted values are LEGENDRE and CHEBYSHEV, for Legendre and
Chebyshev polynomials and SPLINE3 and SPLINE1 for a cubic spline
and linear spline with uniformly spaced
break points.
.le
.ls order
Order of the polynomial to be fit or the number of polynomial pieces
to be fit by a cubic spline. Order must be greater than or equal to one.
If curve_type is set to LEGENDRE or CHEBYSHEV and order equals one, a constant
term is fit to the data.
.le
.ls xmax, xmin
Minimum and maximum x values. All x values of interest
including the data x values and the x values of any curve to be evaluated
must fall in the range xmin <= x <= xmax. Checking for out of bounds x
values is the responsibility of user.

DESCRIPTION
Allocate space for the curve descriptor structure and the arrays and
vectors used by the numerical routines. Initialize all arrays and vectors
to zero. Return the
curve descriptor to the calling routine.
.ih
NOTES
CVINIT must be the first CURFIT routine called. CVINIT returns if an
illegal curve type is requested.
