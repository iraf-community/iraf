DESCRIPTION
Calculate the reduced chi-squared of the fit and the standard deviation
of the equivalent power series coefficients for fitted Legendre and
Chebyshev polynomials. The errors are rescaled to the equivalent power 
series and to the original data range.

NOTES
The standard deviation of the fit is the square root of the sum of the
weighted squares of the residuals divided by the number of degrees of freedom.
If the weights are equal, then the reduced chi-squared is the
variance of the fit
The error of the j-th coefficient is the square root of the j-th diagonal
element of the inverse of the data matrix. If the weights are equal to one,
then the errors are scaled by the square root of the variance of the data.
