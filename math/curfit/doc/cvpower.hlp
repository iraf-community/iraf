ARGUMENTS
.ls cv      
Pointer to the curve descriptor structure.
.le
.ls ps_coeff
The output array of power series coefficients.
.le
.ls ncoeff
The output number of coefficients in the fit.

DESCRIPTION
This routine routines the equivlalent power series fit coefficients
and the number of coefficients.

The coefficients of either a legendre or chebyshev solution can be converted
to power series coefficients of the form y = a0 + a1*x + a2*x**2 + a3*x**3...
The output coefficients are scaled to the original data range.

NOTES
Only legendre and chebyshev coefficients are converted. An error is
reported for other curve types.
