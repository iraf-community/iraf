		  LIBVOTABLE v1.0 Installation Instructions
		 ===========================================


	LIBVOTABLE is distributed as a GZip compressed tarball of either 
the source, or pre-built binaries for a particular platform.  Current dist-
ributions include:

    libvotable-src.tar.gz	    Source code distribution 
    libvotable-linux.tar.gz	    Linux binary distribution
    libvotable-osx.tar.gz	    Mac OSX (Universal Binary) distribution


See the README file for a complete list of the contents in the source
distribution.  Binary distributions will contain the following files
and directories:

    INSTALL		This file
    libvotable.a	The votable library 
    votParse.h		Optional include file for C source

Software wishing to use the language binding wrappers should build from
source.


Requirements Checklist:

    o   The parser library is entirely self-contained, there are no known 
	external requirements.


=======================
To Install from Source:
=======================


1)  Create a directory for the source, and unpack the distirbution tar file:

	% mkdir /path/libvotable		    # create directory
	% cd /path/libvotable			    # go there
	% tar zxf /path/libvotable-src.tar.gz	    # unpack the distrbution

2)  Compile the package:

	% make					    # Do the compilation

3)  To install, copy the library to a system or project directory.  In some
    cases this will require root permission in order to do it.  Assuming you
    want to install in /usr/local/bin, something like the following 
    command:

	% su					    # become 'root'
	# cp -p libvotable.a /usr/local/lib 	    # copy binaries


======================================
To Install from a Binary Distribution:
======================================

1)  Create a temporary directory to unpack the files:

	% mkdir /tmp/libvotable			    # create temp directory
	% cd /tmp/libvotable			    # go there
	% tar zxf /path/libvotable-<arch>.tar.gz    # unpack the distrbution

2)  To install, copy the library to a system or project directory.  In some
    cases this will require root permission in order to do it.  Assuming you
    want to install in /usr/local/bin, something like the following 
    command:

	% su					    # become 'root'
	# cp -p libvotable.a /usr/local/lib 	    # copy binaries
