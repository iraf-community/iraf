.SH NAME
votiminfo \- Print/Get information about a FITS file's structure

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBvotiminfo\fP [\fI-opts\fP] <file> [ <file> .... ]

.SH OPTIONS
The \fIvotiminfo\fP task accepts the following options:
.TP 6
.B \-h, --help
Print a help summary to the terminal and exit.  No processing is done 
following this flag.

.TP 6
.B \-a, --all
Print information for the entire field in an MEF file, e.g. from a mosaic
camera.  If not specified, information for each image extension is printed.
.TP 6
.B \-b, --box
Print the LL and UR corners of the image along with the rotation.
.TP 6
.B \-c, --corners
Print all four WCS image corners in the image.  The ordering of the 
corners is LL, UL, UR, LR.
.TP 6
.B \-i, --info
Print all know image information.
.TP 6
.B \-n, --naxes
Print the pixel dimensions of an image.
.TP 6
.B \-o \fINAME\fP, --output \fINAME\fP
Write the result to the file \fINAME\fP.
.TP 6
.B \-s, --sex
Print values in sexagesimal format.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIvotiminfo\fP task is used to get information about the structure of
FITS files, e.g. to get the center and radius values that might be used in
a VO data query, the corner positions needed to draw a footprint overlay,
or simply the dimensionality of a FITS file (or the extensions in an MEF
file).   If no information options are specified the default is to print
the center position and a radius (in decimal degrees if a WCS is present,
or in pixels otherwise).  In all cases, in no WCS is present in the image
header, zero will be printed.
.PP
If the \fI-b\fP option is used the LL and UR corner positions are printed
along with a rotation of the box that represents.  The \fI-c\fP flag may be
used to explicitly print all four corner positions starting at the LL and
moving clockwise.  The \fI-n\fP flag can be used to print the dimensionality
of an image, similarly the \fI-i\fP flag may be used to print all information
about an image determined by the task.
.PP
By default, and MEF file will cause information about each extension to be
printed.  If the \fI-a\fP flag is used the requested information for all 
extensions in an MEF (e.g from a mosaic camera) will be printed.  This allows
the user the option of getting information about individual rasters within
an MEF or the footprint of the entire FOV.  CFITSIO is used to read the file
and so the syntax to specify an extension number or image section  (see the
CFITSIO documentation) is allowed by the task.

.SH RETURN STATUS
On exit the \fBvotiminfo\fP task will return a zero indicating success, or a 
one indicating an error.

.SH EXAMPLES
.TP 4
1) Print the size of each image extension in an MEF file:

.nf
  % votiminfo -n mef.fits
.fi
.TP 4
2) Print the LL and UR positions of an image as sexigesimal:

.nf
  % voiminfo -b -s image.fits
.fi
.TP 4
3) Print the corner positions of an image as decimal degrees:

.nf
  % voiminfo -c image.fits\n"
.fi
.TP 4
4) Print the box values for an entire mosaic MEF file:\n\n"

.nf
  % voiminfo -b mef.fits\n"
.fi
