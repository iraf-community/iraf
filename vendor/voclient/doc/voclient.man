.TH VOCLIENT 1 "May 2013" "VOClient Package"
.SH NAME
VOClient \- Virtual Observatory (VO) Libraries and Desktop Applications

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBVOClient\fP is a collection of programming APIs and
command-line tools that provide a user-ready VO software distribution for
both scientists and developers.  The initial release of the package is
intended primarily to distribute the completed CLI tools, additional tasks
are planned as new functionality is added to the libraries and as new
standards come on-line in the VO.
.PP
The VOClient package includes a number of command-line utilities
built from the underlying interfaces.  These tasks can be scripted from any
number of environments or used in a standalone manner.  Tasks distributed 
in this release include:

.SH Programming Interfaces
.HP 9
.I libsamp
SAMP interface.  This interface allows an application to send and receive 
SAMP messages but does NOT (at this time) provide a local Hub implementation.
Applications can register their own functions to be used as callbacks in 
response to a message, the API provides only the middle-ware needed to 
handle the SAMP protocol.
.HP 9
.I libvoclient
Client-side VO interface.  This interface uses the VOClient Daemon to access 
a variety of VO web services (Registry, Sesame, DAL services, etc) which 
then communicate to the API to pass information back to the application.
.HP 9
.I libvotable
VOTable parser interface.  The interface provides both read (lax parsing) 
and write (strict compliance) capabilities.  Reference is VOTable v1.2.
.HP 9
.I libvoapps
VO Applications interface.  High-level interface to application functionality.
Tasks are built on these routines to provide the cmdline user interface, 
but are encapsulated in an API to provide this functionality to other 
environments easily (as opposed to having that functionality
be re-implemented using the low-level interfaces).

.SS Dependency Libraries
.HP 16
.I libcurl		
SAMP interface
.HP 16
.I libcfitsio		
C FITSIO interface
.HP 16
.I libexpat		
XML parser
.HP 16
.I libxmlrpc-c	
XML-RPC interface

.SH INSTALLATION
.PP
.B Using Pre-Built Binaries
.PP
Pre-built binary distributions are available containg both source and 
binaries for a specific platform.  These distribution names are of the form
.nf
.RS

        \fIvoclient-<version>-bin.<arch>.tar.gz\fP
.RE
.fi
.PP
where \fI<arch>\fP is one of
.RS
.HP 16
.I linux	
32-bit Linux systems (Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, etc).
.HP 16
.I linux64	
64-bit Linux systems (Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, etc).
.HP 16
.I macosx	
32-bit OSX 10.6 and higher systems for Mac.
.HP 16
.I macintel	
64-bit OSX 10.6 and higher systems for Mac.
.RE

.PP
The distribution file may be unpacked with the command
.nf
.RS

tar zxf /\fI<path>\fP/voclient-\fI<version>\fP-bin.\fI<arch>\fP.tar.gz

.RE
.fi
.PP
This will produce a '\fIvoclient\fP' subdirectory containing the unpacked
distribution.  Within that directory you'll find the following important
directories needed to install the package on the system:

.HP 12
.I bin/            
Task binaries
.HP 12
.I lib/            
API library files
.HP 12
.I include/        
Program header files

.PP
The contents of these directories should be copied to some system directory
available in the normal user paths.  For example, to install in /usr/local
.nf
.RS

% cd /<path>/voclient
% sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
% sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
% sudo cp include/* /usr/local/include
.RE
.fi
.PP
When compiling new applications the appropriate '-I' and '-L' flags will
need to be set to find the libraries and include files needed.  The binary
installation directory should be some directory in the normal $PATH
environment setting.

.B Building VOClient from Source
.PP
The source distribution of the release is containe in the file
.nf
.RS

\fIvoclient-src.tar.gz\fP

.RE
.fi
.PP
It may be unpacked with the command
.nf
.RS

\fItar zxf /<path>/voclient-src.tar.gz\fP

.RE
.fi
.PP
This will produce a 'voclient' subdirectory containing the unpacked
distribution.  Utility scripts are used throughout the system to do the
platform configuration necessary, therefore the only command needed to
build the package is:
.nf
.RS
% cd /<path>/voclient
% make
.RE
.fi
.PP
As with the pre-built binary described above, the following important
directories are needed to install the package on the system:
.nf
.RS

bin/            Task binaries
lib/            API library files
include/        Program header files
.RE
.fi

.PP
In a successful build the libraries and binaries are installed in the
package 'bin' and 'lib' directories, header files needed for program
development are put in the 'include' directory.  The contents of these
directories should be copied to some system directory available in the
normal user paths.  For example, to install in /usr/local
.nf
.RS
% cd /<path>/voclient
% sudo cp bin/* /usr/local/bin
% sudo cp lib/* /usr/local/lib
% sudo cp include/* /usr/local/include
.RE
.fi
.PP
When compiling new applications the appropriate '-I' and '-L' flags will
need to be set to find the libraries and include files needed.  The binary
installation directory should be some directory in the normal $PATH
environment setting.

.B Supported Platforms
.PP
This release currently supports the following platforms:
.nf
.RS

    Mac OSX             32-bit and 64-bit Intel, OSX 10.6 and later
    Linux 32-bit        32-bit Linux systems (Fedora, Redhat, Ubuntu, etc)
    Linux 64-bit        64-bit Linux systems (Fedora, Redhat, Ubuntu, etc)
.RE
.fi
.PP
Additional platforms will be added as needed.
