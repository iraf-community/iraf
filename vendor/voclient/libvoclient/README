VOClient Client language/environment APIs
------------------------------------------

What is provided here is essentially the same VOClient functionality and
API, bound into each target language or environment.  These include so
far, the base C binding, plus Java, FORTRAN, IRAF SPP, Python, PHP, Perl,
and Tcl.  An IDL binding is also planned.
