VOClient TODO (September 2006)
------------------------------

    - Registry interface (to use V1.1 spec)
    - Most SWIG language bindings should be build options to minimize
      the dependencies required to build
    - Registry integration in dalclient for service discovery
    - Support for multiple services in dalclient connection context
    - Query merge capability for DAL discovery queries
    - Additional DAL interfaces (Registry, SSAP, STAP, VOStore, etc)
    - Storage manager with VOSpace interface
    - voclientd logging
    - Async Messaging
    - Async data access (when supported in SIAP etc.)
    - Creating shared client contexts
    - Persisting objects
    - PLASTIC interface ???

We also need to evaluate similar functionality provided by the Astrogrid
Client Runtime, and determine where collaboration on shared components
or interfaces may be worthwhile.
