# Translation instructions.
# 1.  Each message line is of the form key=value.  Translate the value, DO NOT translate the key.
# 2.  The messages may contain arguments that will be filled in by the runtime.  These are of the form:  {0}, {1}, etc.  These must appear as is in the message, though the order may be changed to support proper language syntax.
# 3.  If a single quote character is to appear in the resulting message, it must appear in this file as two consecutive single quote characters.
# 4.  Lines beginning with "#" (like this one) are comment lines and may contain translation instructions.  They need not be translated unless your translated file, rather than this file, will serve as a base for other translators.
