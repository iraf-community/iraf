	We didn't really get to it yesterday, but I wanted to start a
discussion about what specific capabilities we might want to deliver by
June.  My understanding is that "immediately useful" has a very high
priority, and a distribution of desktop tools serves a different audience
than an API in any language.

	This set of tools may be packaged and distributed differently
than the API release but offers something people can immediate begin to
play with, rather than tinkering with code to write their own (that will
hopefully come later as well).  Also, lots of astronomers will simply want
FITS files or tables to appear to their machine, they may be turned off at
the prospect of walking a votable themselves.

	Given that starting position, I took a look at what's currently
available/possible in VOClient and borrowed some ideas from the IRAF
integration, and came up with about two dozen CLI tools that could
realistically be delivered by a June review (assuming work is split up
between core voclient dev and writing utilities from existing interfaces).
These would be C tools, but the same functionality could be wrapped in
an pythonic interface to provide similar high-level capabilities to
programmers (or simply used to build some other VO tool in python).

	This is just a first cut at such a list, but I think it would be
pretty easy to write user-stories about how having these *capabilities* at
the command-line or scripting environment could be used in a science
workflow.  I'd have to think some more about how these fit into the current
ecosystem diagram.  Comments?


Cheers,

Registry:
  vodirectory	VO Resource discovery (keyword search, resolution, info)

Data Access:
  vodata	Query and Access VO data  	(general engine)
  vocatalog	Query VO catalog services	(SAMP load to overlay)      (1
  voimage	Query VO image services		(SAMP load to display)      (1
  vospectrum	Query VO spectrum services	(SAMP load)     	    (1

  dss		Load DSS field in display 	(SAMP to ds9/aladin)        (1
  obslog	Query public observation logs     			    (1

		Notes: do we need SED and/or Time Series access tools here?

VOTable:
  votcnv   	Convert to/from votable format
  votget	Download data access references in a VOTable (w/ selection)
  votsplit	Split a multi-resource votable (opt. output conversion)     (2a
  votjoin	Join multiple votables into a multi-resource table          (2a
  votinfo	Print information about a votable

		Notes: similar tools for VOEvent packets could be written

SAMP:
  samp		SAMP utility command (list clients, start hub, etc) 	    (2a
  send		Send a SAMP message from the cmdline 			    (2a
  listener	Listen for SAMP messages 				    (2a

		Notes: similar tools for VOEvent packets could be written

Cross-Compare
  voxmatch	Cross-compare local table an VO data 			    (3

VOSpace:

  vosput	Put files to a VOSpace		    			    (4
  vosget	Get files from a VOSpace		    		    (4
  vosmove	Move files/nodes between VOSpaces		    	    (4
  voslist	List files/nodes in a VOSpace		    	    	    (4
  vosdelete	Delete files/nodes in a VOSpace		    		    (4

Name Resolver:
  sesame	Resolve object names to positions

Moving Targets:
  skybot	List known moving objects in an image 			    (2b


     Notes:  1)  utility wrapper command around vodata
	     2a) exists as simple demo currently and would need work,
	     2b) could be written, doesn't currently exist
	     3)  would require work on SCC progrmmatic interface
	     4)  would require VOSpace implementation in voclient
