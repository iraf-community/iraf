    This directory contains the example tasks for the LIBSAMP interface.
Current examples include:


      samp	    General SAMP commandline interface
      snoop	    Print all messages available to a client application 
      send 	    Send a message of a specific mtype to one or more apps


Example Programs
----------------

    The interface distribution comes with a 'zztest.c' test application 
meant to exercise various methods of the interface.  This is a largely
undocumented unit test program intended only for development, users 
should instead look at the programs in the 'examples' directory.
Current examples include:


      snoop         Print all messages available to a client application
      send          Send a message of a specific mtype to one or more apps


Examples:

  1)  Print out messages received by a client application:

        % snoop                             print all available messages
        % snoop -m image.load.fits          print only the one mtype
        % snoop -s topcat                   only message from 'TOPCAT'

  2)  Print the usage of the 'send' (or 'snoop') application:

	% send -h

  3)  Broadcast a message to all clients subscribed to a mtype:

	% send image.load.fits http://foo.edu/bar.fits testId testName

  4)  Send a message to a specific app (c4) using synchronous message pattern:

	% send -r c4 -p sync client.env.get HOME

  5)  Send a client multiple messages from a single connection:

	% cat msgs.txt
	client.cmd.exec show noao
	client.cmd.exec imstat dev$pix
	client.cmd.exec imstat dev$pix[*,1:10]
	client.cmd.exec imstat dev$pix[*,10:20]
	client.cmd.exec imstat dev$pix[*,20:30]
	% send -r iraf -f msgs.txt

      The  message text file must containt the mtype as the first value, the
      remainder of the line are the arguments specific to that mtype.


Note that each of these examples assumes an already-running Hub.  A
standalone hub is provided in the 'jsamp' directory included in the
distribution.  To start a hub from the toplevel directory:

	% java -jar jsamp/jsamp-1.3.jar hub

This should be done before trying the above example.  Note that applications
such as Topcat or Aladin have a builtin Hub that can also be used.
