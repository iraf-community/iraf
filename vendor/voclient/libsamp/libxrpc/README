	This directory contains the XMLRPC-C and CURL library sources
needed to build a self-contained library that doesn't require applications
to link to the multiple libraries individually.  This is an acknowledged
hack, but simpler than requiring users to manage the libraries.

	To do this we use the standard sources for each of the packages
and build them with certain options disabled.  The resulting libXXX.a files
are unpacked and repacked into a new 'librpc.a' containing all the needed
components.  The build is accomplished using the 'mklibs' script that may
be called from a Makefile for convenience.

Note:
-----
	There are several filename conflicts in the source tree that keep
this from being as easy as it should be.  When updating to a new version
of either library, the following changes will likely need to be made:

   In the XMLRPC-C source tree:

	mv lib/abyss/src/file.c		lib/abyss/src/abyss_file.c
	mv lib/abyss/src/http.c		lib/abyss/src/abyss_http.c
	mv lib/abyss/src/trace.c	lib/abyss/src/abyss_trace.c
	mv lib/abyss/src/file.lo	lib/abyss/src/abyss_file.lo
	mv lib/abyss/src/http.lo	lib/abyss/src/abyss_http.lo
	mv lib/abyss/src/trace.lo	lib/abyss/src/abyss_trace.lo

	mv lib/util/casprintf.c		lib/util/ucasprintf.c
	mv lib/libutil/select.c		lib/libutil/uselect.c

	And edit the Makefile in the appropriate directory with the change.
