    - the resource description string wasn't read properly (4/3/13)

      causing a timeout for registry queries return a large number of 
      results, in the app this meant the number of results was being reported
      as zero.  Increased the timeout to 10-min  (PD-833) (4/3/13)

      feature and still in the code, but the man page and online help
      don't mention it to avoid confusing the user.  Can be revived in

      This was done to allow arguments such as "-f=bar" to be rewritten
      as "--foo=bar" so it could be properly parsed by getopt_long().  This
      addresses a number of comments about the arg parsing which aren't
      strictly bug reports.  (6/25/13)

voapps/lib/voUtil.c
    - pretty-print of results wasn't checking for an empty result pointer,
