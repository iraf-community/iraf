This directory contains generic code used in various tasks that combine
images.

=======
V2.13
=======

icgdata.gx
    Fixed a problem where 3-D images were closing an image in the case
    of many bands leading to a slow execution (10/20/06, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.3
=======

icmask.x
iclog.x
icombine.h
    As a special unadvertised feature the "maskvalue" parameter may be
    specified with a leading '<' or '>'.  Ultimately a full expression
    should be added and documented.  (7/26/04, Valdes)

icmask.x
    Added a feature to allow masks specified without a path to be found
    either in the current directory or the directory with the image.  This
    is useful when images to be combined are distributed across multiple
    directories.  (7/16/04, Valdes)
