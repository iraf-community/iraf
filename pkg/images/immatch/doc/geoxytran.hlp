NAME
geoxytran -- geometrically transform a list of coordinates
.ih
USAGE
geoxytran input output database transforms
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input coordinate files to be transformed.
.le
.ls output
The list of output transformed coordinate files. The number of output files must
be one or equal to the number of input files.
.le
.ls database
The name of the text database file written by the geomap task which
contains the desired spatial transformation.
If database is undefined geoxytran computes
a linear transformation using the current
values of the xref, yref, xout, yout, xshift, yshift, xmag, ymag, xrotation,
and yrotation parameters.
.le
.ls transforms
The database record containing the desired spatial transformation. 
The number of records must be one or equal to the number of input coordinate
files. Transforms is usually the name of the coordinate file that the
geomap task used to compute the spatial transformation.
If defined the values of xref, yref, xout, yout, xshift, yshift, xmag, ymag,
xrotation, and yrotation will supersede the computed values in the
database file.
.le
.ls geometry = "geometric" (linear|geometric)
The type of geometric transformation. The geometry parameter is
only requested if database is defined. The options are:
.ls linear
Perform only the linear part of the spatial transformation.
.le
.ls geometric
Compute both the linear and distortion portions of the spatial transformation.
.le
.le
.ls direction = "forward" (forward|backward)
The transformation direction may be "forward" or "backward".  The forward
direction directly evaluates the database solution.  The backward
direction iteratively determines the coordinate which evaluates to the
specified coordinate.
.le
.ls xref = INDEF, yref = INDEF
The x and y coordinates of the reference origin.
If the database file is undefined xref and
yref  default to [0.0,0.0]. Otherwise xref and yref
default to the mean of minimum and maximum x and y values
[(xmin + xmax) / 2.0, (ymin + ymax) / 2.0] computed by geomap.
.le
.ls xmag = INDEF, ymag = INDEF
The x and y scale factors in input units
per reference unit. If database is undefined xmag and ymag
default to [1.0, 1.0]. Otherwise xmag and ymag default to the values computed
by geomap. 
.le
.ls xrotation = INDEF, yrotation = INDEF
The x and y rotation angles in degrees measured counter-clockwise with
respect to the x and y axes. If database
is undefined then xrotation and yrotation are interpreted as the
rotation of the coordinates with respect to the x and y axes and
default to [0.0, 0.0]. For example xrotation and yrotation values of
[30.0, 30.0] will rotate a point 30 counter-clockwise with respect
to the x and y axes.  Otherwise xrotation and yrotation default to the
values computed by geomap. Geomap computes the x and y rotation angles
of the x and y axes, not the rotation angle of the coordinates. An output
coordinate system rotated 30 degrees counter-clockwise with respect
to the reference coordinate system will produce xrotation and yrotation
values of [330.0,330.0] or equivalently [-30.0,-30.0] in the database file
not [30.0,30.0].
.le
.ls xout = INDEF, yout = INDEF
The x and y coordinates of the output origin.
If the database file is undefined xout and
yout  default to [0.0,0.0].
If database is defined xout and yout
default to the position that the reference origin [xref,yref]
occupies in the transformed system.
.le
.ls xshift = INDEF, yshift = INDEF
The x and y shift of the reference origin in output units.
If the database file is undefined xshift and yshift default to [0.0,0.0].
If the database file is defined xshift and yshift default to the
values computed by geomap. If defined xshift and yshift take precedence over
the x and y shifts determined from xref, yref, xout and yout.
.le
.ls xcolumn = 1, ycolumn = 2
The columns in the input coordinate file containing the x and y coordinates.
.le
.ls calctype = "real"
The precision of the coordinate transformation calculations. The options
are "real" and "double".  Note that this only applies to a "forward"
transformation.  The "backward" transformation is done iteratively and
is always calculated in double precision to get the best convergence.
.le
.ls xformat = "", yformat = ""
The default output format for the computed x and y coordinates. If
xformat and yformat are undefined geoxytran outputs the coordinates
using the maximum of the precision of the input coordinates
and the value of the \fImin_sigdigits\fR parameter.
.le
.ls min_sigdigits = 7
The minimum precision of the output x and y coordinates.
.le

DESCRIPTION

GEOXYTRAN applies  a coordinate transformation to a list of reference
coordinates in the text file \fIinput\fR and writes the transformed
coordinates to the text file \fIoutput\fR. The input  coordinates
are read from, and the output coordinates written to, columns
\fIxcolumn\fR and \fIycolumn\fR in the input and output
files. The format of the output coordinates can be specified using the
\fIxformat\fR and \fIyformat\fR parameters. If the output formats
are unspecified the coordinates are written out with a precision
which is the maximum of the precision of the input coordinates
and the value of the \fImin_sigdigits\fR parameter. All remaining fields in
the input file are copied to the output file without modification.
Blank lines and comment lines are also passed to the output file
unaltered.

The coordinate transformation either be read from record \fItransforms\fR
in the database file \fIdatabase\fR computed by GEOMAP, or specified
by the user via the \fIxref\fR, \fIyref\fR, \fIxmag\fR, \fIymag\fR,
\fIxrotation\fR, \fIyrotation\fR, \fIxout\fR, \fIyout\fR, \fIxshift\fR,
and \fIyshift\fR parameters.

The transformation computed by GEOMAP has the following form.

.nf
	xout = f (xref, yref)
	yout = g (xref, yref)
.fi

The functions f and g are either a power series polynomial or a Legendre
or Chebyshev polynomial surface whose order and region of validity were
set by the user when GEOMAP was run. The computed transformation is
arbitrary and does not correspond to any physically meaningful model.
However the first order terms can be given the simple geometrical
interpretation shown below.

.nf
	xout = a + b * xref + c * yref
	yout = d + e * xref + f * yref
	   b = xmag * cos (xrotation)
	   c = ymag * sin (yrotation)
	   e = -xmag * sin (xrotation)
	   f = ymag * cos (yrotation)
	   a = x0 - b * xref0 - c * yref0 = xshift
	   d = y0 - e * xref0 - f * yref0 = xshift
.fi

Xref0, yref0, x0, and
y0 are the origins of the reference and output coordinate systems
respectively. xmag and ymag are the x and y scale factors in output units
per reference unit and xrotation and yrotation are the rotation angles measured
counter-clockwise of the x and y axes.

The linear portion of the GEOMAP transformation may be altered after the fact
by setting some or all of the parameters \fIxref\fR, \fIyref\fR, \fIxout\fR,
\fIyout\fR, \fIxshift\fR, \fIyshift\fR, \fIxmag\fR, \fIymag\fR, \fIxrotation\fR,
and \fIyrotation\fR. If defined these parameters will replace the corresponding
values in the GEOMAP database file.
Xref, yref, xshift, yshift, xout and yout can be used to redefine the shift
where xshift and yshift take precedence over xref, yref, xout and yout.
Xmag, and ymag can be used to reset the scale of the transformation.
Xrotation and yrotation can be used to redefine the orientation of the
transformation. Note that xrotation and yrotation are interpreted as
the rotation of the coordinate axes not the coordinates.
The default values of these parameters are.

.nf
	  xref = (xmin + xmax) / 2.0
	  yref = (ymin + ymax) / 2.0
	  xout = f (xref,yref)
	  yout = g (xref,yref)
	xshift = xshift (database) = xout - f(xref,yref)
	yshift = yshift (database) = yout - g(xref,yref)
	  xmag = xmag (database)
	  ymag = ymag (database)
     xrotation = xrotation (database)
     yrotation = yrotation (database)
.fi

If the GEOMAP database is undefined then GEOXYTRAN performs a linear
transformation on the input coordinates using the parameters
\fIxref\fR, \fIyref\fR, \fIxmag\fR, \fIymag\fR, \fIxrotation\fR,
\fIyrotation\fR, \fIxout\fR, \fIyout\fR, \fIxshift\fR, and
\fIyshift\fR as shown below. Note that in this case xrotation and
yrotation are interpreted as the rotation of the coordinates
themselves not the coordinate axes.

.nf
	xout = a + b * xref + c * yref
	yout = d + e * xref + f * yref
	   b = xmag * cos (xrotation)
	   c = -ymag * sin (yrotation)
	   e = xmag * sin (xrotation)
	   f = ymag * cos (yrotation)
	   a = xo - b * xref0 - c * yref0 = xshift
	   d = yo - e * xref0 - f * yref0 = xshift
.fi

Forward vs. Backward Transformations

The transformation direction is specified by the \fIdirection\fR parameter
which may take the values "forward" or "backward".  The forward transformation
is a direct evaluation of the database solution.  The backward
transformation is an iterative evaluation to obtain the coordinate which
evaluates to the desired coordinate.

When the same solution is used with \fBgeotran\fR to transform an image
to another image matching the "reference" image is needed to obtain
coordinates in the transformed image.  This is because the transformation
is produced with \fBgeomap\fR to map "reference" coordinates to the
image which is subsequently transformed.  Therefore, if you have coordinates
in the image which has been transformed then you should use the "backward"
transformation to get coordinates for the transformed image.  But if you
have standard coordinates from the reference image being matched then you
would use the "forward" transformation.  If you are not sure then you can
use \fBtvmark\fR to overlay the results to find which direction produces
the desired coordinates.

Because the backward transformation is performed iteratively it can be
slow.  If higher speeds are desired, such as when evaluating a very
large number of coordinates, one might create a transformation solution
that can be evaluated in the forward direction.  This is done by
using \fBgeomap\fR with the reference and target coordinates reversed.

FORMATS

A  format  specification has the form "%w.dCn", where w is the field
width, d is the number of decimal places or the number of digits  of
precision,  C  is  the  format  code,  and  n is radix character for
format code "r" only.  The w and d fields are optional.  The  format
codes C are as follows:
   
.nf
b       boolean (YES or NO)
c       single character (c or '\c' or '\0nnn')
d       decimal integer
e       exponential format (D specifies the precision)
f       fixed format (D specifies the number of decimal places)
g       general format (D specifies the precision)
h       hms format (hh:mm:ss.ss, D = no. decimal places)
m       minutes, seconds (or hours, minutes) (mm:ss.ss)
o       octal integer
rN      convert integer in any radix N
s       string (D field specifies max chars to print)
t       advance To column given as field W
u       unsigned decimal integer
w       output the number of spaces given by field W
x       hexadecimal integer
z       complex format (r,r) (D = precision)
   
Conventions for w (field width) specification:
   
    W =  n      right justify in field of N characters, blank fill
        -n      left justify in field of N characters, blank fill
        0n      zero fill at left (only if right justified)
absent, 0       use as much space as needed (D field sets precision)
   
Escape sequences (e.g. "\n" for newline):
   
\b      backspace   (not implemented)
\f      formfeed
\n      newline (crlf)
\r      carriage return
\t      tab
\"      string delimiter character
\'      character constant delimiter character
\\      backslash character
\nnn    octal value of character
   
Examples
   
%s          format a string using as much space as required
%-10s       left justify a string in a field of 10 characters

2.  Evaluate the backward transformation to take coordinates from the
output system to the reference system.  In this example we use the
output of the first example to illustrate getting back the coordinates
used in the original geomap input.

3. Evaluate the transform computed in example 1 for the same list of

4. Evaluate the same transformation for the same unknowns as before
using the linear transformation parameters not the transform computed
by geomap. Note that the angle is the negative of the one defined
in the database file.

    cl> geoxytran unknowns unknowns.tran "" xmag=1.18 ymag=1.18 \
