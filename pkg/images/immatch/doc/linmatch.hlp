NAME
linmatch -- linearly match the intensity scales of 1 and 2D images
.ih
USAGE
linmatch input reference regions lintransform
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input images to be matched.
.le
.ls reference
The list of reference images to which the input images are to be matched
if \fIscaling\fR  is one of the "mean", "median", "mode", or "fit"
algorithms, or the list of reference photometry files if \fIscaling\fR
specifies the "photometry" algorithm. The number of reference images or
reference photometry files must be one or equal to the number of input
images.
.le
.ls regions
The list of image regions used to compute the intensity 
matching function if \fIscaling\fR is one of the "mean", "median", "mode",
or "fit" algorithms, or a list of the input photometry files if
\fIscaling\fR specifies the "photometry" algorithm. In the former
case \fIregions\fR may be: 1) a string of the form "grid nx ny" defining
a grid of nx by ny equally spaced and sized image regions spanning the
entire image, 2) a list of object coordinates separated by commas e.g.
"303 401, 131 202", 3) a list of image sections separated by whitespace
e.g "[101:200,101:200] [301:400,301:400]",
4) the name of a text file containing a list of object coordinates separated
by newlines, and 5) the name of a text file containing a list of image
sections separated by whitespace and/or newlines.
.le
.ls lintransform
The name of the text file where the computed scaling factors are written.
If \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "yes", a single record containing the computed
bscale and bzero factors for each image region or object, and the
average bscale and bzero, is written to the text database
file for each input image. If \fIdatabasefmt\fR = "no", a single line
containing the input image name, bscale factor, bzero factor, error
in bscale, and error in bzero is written to a simple text file for
each image.
.le
.ls output = ""
The list of output matched images. If \fIoutput\fR is the NULL string
then bscale  and bzero are computed for each input image and written to
\fIlintransform\fR, but no output images are written. If \fIoutput\fR
is not NULL then the number of output images must equal the number of
input images.
.le
.ls databasefmt = yes
If \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "yes" the computed bscale and bzero factors
are written to a text database file, otherwise they are written to a
simple text file.
.le
.ls records = ""
The list of records to be written to or read from \fIlintransform\fR one
input image. If \fIrecords\fR is NULL then the output or input record names
are assumed to be the names of the input images. If \fIrecords\fR is not NULL
then the record names in \fIrecords\fR are used to write / read the
database records. This parameter is useful for users
who, wish to compute the bscale and bzero factors using images that have
been processed
in some manner (e.g. smoothed), but apply the computed bscale and bzero
factors to the original unprocessed images. If more than one record
with the same name exists in \fIlintransform\fR then the most recently written
record takes precedence. The records parameter is ignored if
\fIdatabasefmt\fR is "no".
.le
.ls append = yes
Append new records to an existing \fIlintransform\fR file or start a new 
file for each execution of LINMATCH? The append parameter is
ignored if \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "no".
.le
.ls shifts = ""
An optional list of shifts files containing the x and y shifts to be applied
to the reference regions to determine their positions in
the input images. The number of shifts files must equal the number of
reference images. The shifts are listed in the shifts file, 1 shift per line,
with the x and y shifts in
columns 1 and 2 respectively. If there are fewer x and y shifts defined
in the shifts file than there are input images, the extra input
images will be assigned x and y shifts of \fIxshift\fR and \fIyshift\fR
respectively. The shifts parameter is ignored if the \fIscaling\fR
parameter is set to "photometry".
.le
.ls xshift = 0.0 yshift = 0.0
The default x and y shifts to be applied to the reference image regions
or objects to compute their positions in the input image.
Values in \fIshifts\fR take precedence over the values of \fIxshift\fR and
\fIyshift\fR. xshift and yshift are ignored if the \fIscaling\fR parameter
is set to "photometry".
.le
.ls dnx = 31 dny = 31
The default size of a single image region used to compute the bscale
and bzero factors if \fIscaling\fR is one of the "mean", "median", "mode",
or "fit" algorithms and \fIregions\fR is a coordinate list rather than
a sections list.  dnx and dny are ignored if the \fIscaling\fR parameter
is set to "photometry".
.le
.ls maxnregions = 100
The maximum number of image regions or objects with measured photometry
that can be used to compute the bscale and bzero factors.
.le
.ls scaling = "mean mean"
The algorithms used to compute the bscale and bzero factors respectively.
The options are:
.ls mean median mode
Bscale or bzero are computed using the "mean", "median", or "mode" statistic
for each input and reference region individually. If one of the bscale or
bzero fitting
algorithms is set to "mean", "median", or "mode", the remaining factor
must be set to "mean", "median" or "mode" or  a numerical constant,
e.g. "mean mean", "mean -100.0" or "2.63 mode".
If both algorithms are set to "mean", "median", or "mode" bscale will be
computed using the specified statistic and bzero will be set to 0.0
If more than one input region is defined then a weighted least squares
fit of the reference statistics to the input image statistics  
is performed and used to compute the final bscale and bzero factors.
.le
.ls fit    
Bscale and bzero are computed for each input image region individually
by performing a least squares fit of the reference image pixels to
the input image pixels. If more than one input image region is defined
the final bscale and bzero factors are computed by averaging,
weighted by their signal-to-noise ratios, the individual bscale and bzero
values.  If one of the bscale or bzero fitting
algorithms is set to "fit", the remaining factor must either also
be computed with the "fit" algorithm  or set to a numerical constant,
e.g. "fit fit", "fit -100.0", or "2.63 fit".
.le
.ls photometry
Bscale and/or bzero are computed for each input object individually
using photometry computed for a set of objects common to the reference
and input images.  If more than one input object is defined
the final bscale and bzero factors are computed by averaging,
weighted by their signal-to-noise ratios, the individual bscale and bzero
values.  If one of the bscale or bzero fitting
algorithms is set to "photometry", the remaining factor must either also
be computed with the "photometry" algorithm or set to a numerical
constant, e.g. "photometry photometry", "photometry -100.0", or
"2.63 photometry".
.le
.ls number
Bscale and/or bzero are set to user defined numerical constants,
e.g. "2.62 -55.0" or  "2.62 median". If both bscale and bzero are numerical
constants, LINMATCH must be run in non-interactive mode. If only one of bscale
or bzero is a numerical constant, any of the "mean", "median", "mode", "fit",
or "photometry" algorithms may be used to compute the remaining factor.
.le
.ls file
Bscale and bzero are not computed but instead read from record \fIrecord\fR in
the text database file \fIlintransform\fR if \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "yes",
or the next line of a simple text file if \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "no".
.le

Further description of the matching algorithms can be found in the ALGORITHMS
section.
.le
.ls datamin = INDEF datamax = INDEF
The minimum and maximum good data values. Datamin and datamax are used by
the "mean", "median", and "mode" scaling algorithms to reject entire
image regions from the final fit, and by the "fit" algorithm to reject
individual bad pixels from the least squares fits for the individual
regions.
.le
.ls maxiter = 10
The maximum number of iterations performed by the least squares fitting
algorithm.
.le
.ls nreject = 0
The maximum number of rejection cycles used to detect and reject bad pixels
from the fit if the scaling algorithm is "fit" or bad regions / objects
from the fit if the scaling algorithm is "mean", "median", "mode", "fit",
or "photometry".
.le
.ls loreject = INDEF hireject = INDEF
The high- and low-side bad data rejection limits used to detect and reject
deviant pixels from the fit if the scaling algorithm is "fit" or bad
regions / objects from the fit if the scaling algorithm is "mean", "median",
"mode", "fit", or "photometry".
.le
.ls gain = "1.0 1.0" readnoise = "0.0 0.0"
The reference and input image gain and readout noise in e-/ADU and
e- respectively. Gain and readout may be numerical constants or the
image header keyword containing the actual gain and/or readout noise
value. Gain and readnoise are used by the "mean", "median", "mode",
and "fit" algorithms to estimate the expected errors in the computed
"mean", "median", or "mode" statistics,  and by the "fit" algorithm
to compute the per pixel errors values.
.le
.ls interactive = no
Compute the bscale and bzero scaling factors for each image interactively
using graphics cursor and optionally image cursor input.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print messages about the progress of the task during task execution in
non-interactive mode.

DESCRIPTION

LINMATCH computes the bscale and bzero factors required to match
the intensity scales of a list of input
images \fIinput\fR to the intensity scales of a list of reference
images \fIreference\fR using the following definition of
bscale and bzero and a variety of techniques.

.nf
	reference = bscale * input + bzero
.fi

The computed bscale and bzero factors are stored
in the text file \fIlintransform\fR, in the record \fIrecords\fR if
\fIdatabasefmt\fR is "yes", or a single line of a simple text file
if \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "no". One record is written to the output file
file for each input image. If a non NULL list of output images
\fIoutput\fR is supplied, a scaled output image is written for
each input image. LINMATCH is intended to solve 1D and 2D image intensity
matching problems where the input and reference images: 1) have the same
pixel scale and orientation, 2) differ in intensity by at most a scale
factor and a zero point, and 3) contain one or more regions or objects in
common that can be used to compute the scaling factors. Some of the scaling
algorithms also require that the images registered and have identical
point spread functions. LINMATCH cannot be used to compute or apply non-linear
intensity matching functions.

If \fIscaling\fR = "mean", "median", "mode", or "fit" bscale and bzero
are computed directly from the input and reference image data using the
image sections specified in the \fIregions\fR and one of the above fitting
techniques as described in the ALGORITHMS section. All four algorithms
require accurate knowledge of the measurement errors which in turn
require accurate knowledge of the input and reference image gain and
readout noise values. Gain and readout noise values can be entered by
setting the \fIgain\fR and \fIreadnouse\fR parameters to the appropriate
numerical values or image header keyword.

\fIRegions\fR is interpreted as either: 1) a string of
the form "grid nx ny" specifying a list of nx by ny image sections
spanning the entire image, 2) a string defining the coordinates of a list
of objects separated by commas e.g.
"103.3 189.2, 204.4 389.7", 3) a string containing a list of image
sections separated by whitespace, e.g "[100:203,200:300] [400:500,400:500]"
4) the name of a text file containing the coordinates of one or
more objects, one object per line, with the x and y coordinates
in columns 1 and 2 respectively, 5) the name of a text
file containing a list of image sections separated by whitespace and/or
newlines.  The image sections specifications, or alternatively
the object coordinates and the parameters \fIdnx\fR and \fIdny\fR,
determine the size of the input and reference image data regions to be
extracted and used to compute the bscale and bzero factors.
These image regions should be selected with care. Ideal regions
span a range of intensity values and contain both object and background
data. 

If \fIscaling\fR = "photometry", the bscale and bzero factors
are computed directly from data in the input and reference image photometry
files using the technique described in the ALGORITHMS section.
In this case \fIregions\fR is a list of the input image photometry
files and \fIreference\fR are the corresponding reference image
photometry files written by a separate photometry task.
These photometry files are simple text files with the object
sky values, errors in the sky values, magnitudes, and errors in the
magnitudes in columns 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

An image region is rejected from the fit if it contains data outside the
limits specified by the \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR parameters
and \fIscaling\fR =
"mean", "median", or "mode". A pixel is rejected from the fit for an
individual region if the pixel value is outside the limits specified
by datamin and datamax, and the scaling algorithm is "fit". The datamin
and datamax parameters are not used by the "photometry" scaling algorithm .

Deviant pixels can be rejected from the fits to individual image regions
if \fIscaling\fR = "fit", and \fInreject\fR, \fIloreject\fR, and
\fIhireject\fR are set appropriately. Nreject, loreject and reject
are also be used by all the scaling algorithms  to reject image regions
which contribute deviant bscale and bzero values.

The computed bscale and bzero value for each region and the final bscale 
and bzero value for each input image are written to the linear
transformation file \fIlintransform\fR.
If \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "yes" each result is written to a record whose name
is either identical to the name of the input
image or supplied by the user via the \fIrecords\fR parameter .
If \fIdatabasefmt\fR is "no", then a single line containing the input image
name and the computed bscale and bzero values and their errors
is written to the output shifts file.

If a list of output image names have been supplied then the bscale and
bzero values will be applied to the input images to compute the output images.

If the \fIscaling\fR parameter is set to "file" then the shifts
computed in a previous run of LINMATCH will be read from the \fIlintransform\fR
file and applied to the input images to compute the output images.
If no record list is supplied by the user LINMATCH will
search for a record whose name is the same as the input image name. If more than
one record of the same name is found then the most recently written
record will be used.

In non-interactive mode the task parameters are set at task startup time
and the input images are processed sequentially. If the \fIverbose\fR
flag is set, messages about the progress of the task are printed on the
screen as the task is running.

In interactive mode the user can mark the regions to be used
to compute the matching function on the image display, show/set the data
and algorithm parameters, compute, recompute,  and plot 
matching function, and interactively delete and undelete
bad data from the fits using the plots and graphics cursor. A summary
of the available interactive commands is given in the CURSOR COMMANDS
section.

ALGORITHMS

MEAN, MEDIAN, AND MODE

For each input and reference image region the mean, median, mode, statistic
and an error estimate for that statistic are computed as shown below,
mstat is for mean, median, or mode statistic, emstat stands for the error
estimate, stdev for the measured standard deviation, and npix for the
number of points.

.nf
       mstat = mean, median, or mode 
      emstat = min (sqrt (mean / gain + readnoise ** 2 / gain ** 2),
               stdev / sqrt(npix))
.fi

If only a single image region is specified then mstat is used to compute
one of bscale or bzero but not both as shown below.  Bscale is computed by
default.

.nf
         bscale = mstat[ref] / mstat[input]
    err[bscale] = abs (bscale) * sqrt (emstat[ref] ** 2 / mstat[ref] ** 2 +
	          emstat[input] ** 2 / mstat[input] ** 2)
	  bzero = constant
     err[bzero] = 0.0

	  bzero = mstat[ref] - mstat[input]
     err[bzero] = sqrt (emstat[ref] ** 2 + emstat[input] ** 2)
	 bscale = constant
    err[bscale] = 0.0
.fi

If more than one image region is defined then the computed mean, median,
or mode values for the input and reference image regions are used as
shown below to compute the bscale and bzero factors and their errors
using a weighted least squares fit.

.nf
	mstat[ref] = bscale * mstat[input] + bzero
.fi

If an image region contains data outside the limits defined
by \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR that image region is eliminated
entirely from the fit.

The parameters \fInreject\fR, \fIloreject\fR,
and \fIhireject\fR are used to detect and automatically eliminate
deviant data points from the final least squares fit. If for some reason
bscale or bzero cannot be fit, default values of 1.0 and 0.0 are
assigned.

The mean, median, and mode algorithms depend on the global properties of
the image regions. These algorithms do require the reference and
input images to have the same pixel scale and orientation,
but do not automatically require the reference and input images
to have the same point spread function. Small shifts between the reference
and input images can be removed using the \fIshifts\fR, \fIxshift\fR, and
\fIyshift\fR parameters.

If the image regions contain stars, then either regions should be large
enough to include all the flux of the stars in which case the images
do not have to have the same psf, or the psfs should be the same so
that same portion of the psf is sampled. The best image regions for
matching will contain object and background information.

FIT

For each input and reference image the bscale and bzero factors are
computed by doing a pixel to pixel weighted least squares fit of the reference
image counts to the input image counts as shown below.

.nf
    counts[ref] = bscale * counts[input] + bzero
         weight = 1.0 / (err[ref] ** 2 + bscale ** 2 * err[input] ** 2)
       err[ref] = sqrt (counts[ref] / gain[ref] + readnoise[ref] ** 2 /
                  gain[ref] ** 2)
     err[input] = sqrt (counts[input] / gain[input] +
     		  readnoise[input] ** 2 / gain[input] ** 2)
.fi

The fitting technique takes into account errors in both the reference and
input image counts and provides an error estimate for the computed bscale
and bzero factors. Bad data are rejected
automatically from the fit by setting the \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR
parameters. Deviant pixels are rejected from the fit by setting the
\fInreject\fR, \fIloreject\fR, and \fIhireject\fR parameters appropriately.

The final bscale and bzero for the input image are computed by calculating
the average weighted by their errors  of the individual bscale and bzero
values. The parameters \fInreject\fR, \fIloreject\fR, and \fIhirject\fR
can be used to automatically detect and reject deviant points.

The fit algorithm depends on the results of pixel to pixel fits in 
each reference and input image region. The technique requires that the
images be spatially registered and psfmatched before it is employed.
Each input and reference image should contain a range of pixel intensities
so that both bscale and bzero can be accurately determined.

PHOTOMETRY

For each object common to the reference and input photometry files
the input sky values sky, errors in the sky values serr,
magnitudes mag, and magnitude errors merr are used to compute the 
bscale and bzero factors and estimate their errors as shown
below.

.nf
	 bscale = 10.0 ** ((mag[ref] - mag[input]) / 2.5)
	  bzero = sky[ref] - bscale * sky[input]
    err[bscale] = 0.4 * log(10.0) * bscale * sqrt (merr[ref] ** 2 +
		  magerr[input] ** 2)) 
     err[bzero] = sqrt (serr[ref] ** 2 + err[bscale] ** 2 *
                  sky[input] ** 2 + bscale ** 2 * sky[input] ** 2)
.fi

The final bscale and bzero for the input image are computed by calculation
the average of the individual bscale and bzero values weighted by their
errors. The parameters \fInreject\fR, \fIloreject\fR, and \fIhirject\fR can
be used to automatically detect and reject deviant points.

THE LEAST SQUARES FITTING TECHNIQUE

The least squares fitting code performs a double linear regression on
the x and y points,  taking into account the errors in both x and y.

The best fitting line is the defined below.

.nf
		y = a * x + b
.fi

The error ellipses  are 

.nf
	S = (x - xfit) ** 2 / err[x] ** 2 + (y - yfit) ** 2 /
	    err[y] ** 2   
.fi

where S is the quantity to be minimized. Initial values of a and b are
estimated by  fitting the data to a straight line assuming uniform
weighting.  The best fit values of a and b are then
determined by iterating on the relationship

.nf
	dy = x' * da + db
.fi

where da and db are corrections to the previously determined values of a and
b and dy and x' are defined as.

.nf
	dy = y - (ax + b)
	x' = x + a * err[x] ** 2 * dy / (a ** 2 * err[x] ** 2 +
	     err[y] ** 2) 
.fi

The new values of the a and b then become.

.nf
        a = a + da
	b = b + db
.fi

EXAMPLES

1. Match the intensity scales of a list of images to a reference
image using a list of stars on the displayed reference image with
the image cursor and the "mean" scaling algorithm. Assume that none
of the stars are saturated and that a radius of 31 pixels is sufficient
to include all the flux from the stars plus some background flux.
Make sure that the correct gain and readout noise values are in the
image headers.

.nf
	cl> display refimage 1 

	cl> rimcursor > objlist
	    ... mark several candidate stars by moving the cursor to the
	        star of interest and hitting the space bar key
	    ... type EOF to terminate the list

	cl> linmatch @imlist refimage objlist lintran.db \
	    out=@outlist dnx=31 dny=31 scaling="mean mean" gain=gain \
	    readnoise=readnoise
.fi

2. Repeat the previous command but force the bzero factor to be -100.0
instead of using the fitted value.

.nf
	cl> linmatch @imlist refimage objlist lintran.db \
	    out=@outlist dnx=31 dny=31 scaling="mean -100.0" \
	    gain=gain readnoise=rdnoise
.fi

3. Repeat the first example but compute bscale and bzero 
the bscale and bzero values using boxcar smoothed versions of 
the input images. Make sure the gain and readout noise are
adjusted appropriately.

.nf
	cl> linmatch @bimlist brefimage objlist lintran.db \
	    dnx=31 dny=31 scaling="mean mean" gain=gain \
	    readnoise=rdnoise

	cl> linmatch @imlist refimage objlist lintran.db \
	    out=@outimlist records=@bimlist scaling="file file"
.fi

4. Match the intensity of an input image which has been spatially
registered and psfmatched to the reference image using the "fit" algorithm
and a single reference image region. Remove the effects of saturated
pixels by setting datamax to 28000 counts, and the effects of any deviant pixels
by setting nreject, loreject, and hireject to appropriate values.

.nf
	cl> linmatch image refimage [50:150,50:150] lintran.db \
	    out=outimage scaling="fit fit" datamax=28000 nreject=3 \
	    loreject=3 hireject=3 gain=gain readnoise=rdnoise
.fi

5. Repeat the previous example but use several image sections to compute
the bscale and bzero values.

.nf
	cl> linmatch image refimage sections lintran.db \
	    out=outimage scaling="fit fit" datamax=28000 nreject=3 \
	    loreject=3 hireject=3 gain=gain readnoise=rdnoise
.fi

6. Match the intensity scales of two images using photometry 
computed with the apphot package qphot task. The two images are
spatially registered, psfmatched, and the photometry aperture is sufficient to
include all the light from the stars. The filecalc task used to compute
the error in the mean sky is in the addon ctio package.

.nf
	cl> display refimage 1 fi+
	cl> rimcursor > objlist
