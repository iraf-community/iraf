NAME
skyxymatch -- match input and reference image x-y coordinates using the
celestial coordinate WCS
.ih
USAGE
skyxymatch input reference output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input images containing the input celestial coordinate wcs.
.le
.ls reference
The list of reference images containing the reference celestial coordinate
wcs. The number of reference images must be one or equal to the number
of input images.
.le
.ls output
The output matched coordinate lists containing:
1) the logical x-y pixel coordinates of a point
in the reference image in columns 1 and 2, 2) the logical x-y pixel
coordinates of the same point in the input image in columns 3 and 4,
3) the world coordinates of the point in the reference image in columns
5 and 6, and 4) the world coordinate of the point in the input image in
columns 7 and 8. The output coordinate list can be
input directly to the geomap task. The number of output files must be 
equal to the number of input images or be the standard output STDOUT.
.le
.ls coords = "grid"
The source of the coordinate list. The options are:
.ls grid    
Generate a list of \fInx * ny\fR coordinates evenly spaced over
the reference image, and beginning and ending at logical coordinates
\fIxmin\fR and \fIxmax\fR in x and \fIymin\fR and \fIymax\fR in y.
.le
.ls <filename>
The name of the text file containing the world coordinates of a set of
points in the reference image.
.le
.le
.ls xmin = INDEF, xmax = INDEF, ymin = INDEF, ymax = INDEF
The minimum and maximum logical x and logical y coordinates used to generate
the grid of control points if \fIcoords\fR = "grid". Xmin, xmax, ymin, and
ymax default to 1, the number of columns in the reference image, 1, and the
number of lines in the reference image, respectively.
.le
.ls nx = 10, ny = 10
The number of points in x and y used to generate the coordinate grid
if \fIcoords\fR = "grid".
.le
.ls wcs = "world"
The world coordinate system of the coordinates.  The options are:
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates which are invariant with
respect to linear transformations of the physical image data.  For example,
if the reference 
image is a rotated section of a larger input image, the physical
coordinates of an object in the reference image are equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the input image, although the logical
pixel coordinates are different.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates which are invariant with
respect to linear transformations of the physical image data and which
are in decimal degrees for the celestial coordinate systems. Obviously if the
wcs is correct the ra and dec of an object
should remain the same no matter how the image
is linearly transformed. The default world coordinate
system is either 1) the value of the environment variable "defwcs" if
set in the user's IRAF environment (normally it is undefined) and present
in the image header, 2) the value of the "system"
attribute in the image header keyword WAT0_001 if present in the
image header or, 3) the "physical" coordinate system.
Care must be taken that the wcs of the input and
reference images are compatible, e.g. it makes no sense to
match the coordinates of a 2D sky projection and a 2D spectral wcs.
.le
.le
.ls xcolumn = 1, ycolumn = 2
The columns in the input coordinate list containing the x and y coordinate
values if \fIcoords\fR = <filename>.
.le
.ls xunits = "", ls yunits = ""
The units of the x and y coordinates in the input coordinate list 
if \fIcoords\fR = <filename>, by default decimal degrees for celestial
coordinate systems, otherwise any units.
The options are:
.ls hours
Input coordinates specified in hours are converted to decimal degrees by
multiplying by 15.0.
.le
.ls native
The internal units of the wcs. No conversions on the input coordinates
are performed.
.le

If the units are not specified the default is "native".
.le
.ls xformat = "%10.3f", yformat = "%10.3f"
The format of the output logical x and y reference and input pixel
coordinates in columns 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 respectively. By default the
coordinates are output right justified in a field of ten spaces with
3 digits following the decimal point. 
.le
.ls rwxformat = "", rwyformat = ""
The format of the output world x and y reference image coordinates
in columns 5 and 6 respectively. The internal default formats will give
reasonable output formats and precision for sky projection coordinates.
.le
.ls wxformat = "", wyformat = ""
The format of the output world x and y input image coordinates
in columns 7 and 8 respectively. The internal default formats will give
reasonable output formats and precision for sky projection coordinates.
.le
.ls min_sigdigits = 7
The minimum precision of the output coordinates if, the formatting parameters
are undefined, or the output world coordinate system is "world" and the wcs
cannot be decoded.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print messages about the progress of the task?
.le

DESCRIPTION

SKYXYMATCH matches the logical x and y pixel coordinates of a set of points 
in the input image \fIinput\fR with the logical x and y pixels coordinates
of the same points in the reference image \fIreference\fR
using world celestial coordinate information
in the image headers. SKYXYMATCH writes its results to the
coordinate file \fIoutput\fR  which is suitable for input to the GEOMAP task.
The input and reference images may be 1D or 2D but must both have
the same dimensionality.

If \fIcoords\fR = "grid", SKYXYMATCH computes a grid of \fInx * ny\fR 
logical x and y pixel coordinates evenly distributed over the 
logical pixel space of the reference image defined by the
\fIxmin\fR, \fIxmax\fR, \fIymin\fR, \fIymax\fR parameters.
The logical x and y reference image pixel coordinates are transformed to
reference image celestial coordinates using
world coordinate information stored in the reference image header.
The reference image celestial coordinates are transformed to 
input image celestial coordinates using world coordinate
system information in both the reference and the input image headers.
Finally the input image celestial coordinates are transformed to logical x and y
input image pixel coordinates using world coordinate system information
stored in the input image header. The transformation sequence looks
like the following for an equatorial celestial coordinate system:

.nf
   (x,y) reference -> (ra,dec) reference  (reference image wcs)
(ra,dec) reference -> (ra,dec) input      (reference and input image wcs)
    (ra,dec) input -> (x,y) input         (input image wcs)
.fi

The reference and input image celestial coordinate systems
may be equatorial, ecliptic, galactic, or supergalactic. The equatorial systems
may be one of: 1) the  mean place pre-IAU 1976 (FK4) system, 2) 
the same as FK4 but without the E-terms (FK4-NO-E) system, 3) the mean
place post-IAU
1976 (FK5) system, 4) or the geocentric apparent place in the post-IAU 1976
(GAPPT) system.

SKYXYMATCH assumes that the celestial coordinate system is specified by the FITS
keywords CTYPE, CRPIX, CRVAL, CD (or alternatively CDELT / CROTA), RADECSYS,
EQUINOX (or EPOCH), MJD-WCS (or MJD-OBS, or DATE-OBS). USERS SHOULD TAKE NOTE
THAT MJD-WCS IS CURRENTLY NEITHER A STANDARD OR A PROPOSED STANDARD FITS
KEYWORD. HOWEVER IT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR, IS REQUIRED TO SPECIFY THE EPOCH OF
THE COORDINATE SYSTEM WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE EPOCH OF THE OBSERVATION.

The first four characters of the values of the ra / longitude and dec / latitude
axis CTYPE keywords specify the celestial coordinate system.  The currently
permitted values of CTYPE[1:4] are RA-- / DEC- for equatorial coordinate
systems, ELON / ELAT for the ecliptic coordinate system, GLON / GLAT for the
galactic coordinate system, and SLON / SLAT for the supergalactic coordinate
system.

The second four characters of the values of the ra / longitude and dec /
latitude axis CTYPE keywords specify the sky projection geometry. IRAF
currently supports the TAN, SIN, ARC, and GLS geometries, and consequently the
currently permitted values of CTYPE[5:8] are -TAN, -ARC, -SIN, and -GLS.
SKYXYMATCH fully supports the TAN, SIN, and ARC projections, but does not fully
support the GLS projection.

If the image celestial coordinate systems are equatorial, the value of the
RADECSYS keyword specifies which fundamental equatorial system is to be
considered. The permitted values of RADECSYS are FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, and GAPPT.
If the RADECSYS keyword is not present in the image header, the values of the
EQUINOX / EPOCH keywords (in that order of precedence) are used to determine
the fundamental equatorial coordinate system. EQUINOX or EPOCH contain the
epoch of the mean place and equinox for the FK4, FK4-NO-E, and FK5 systems
(e.g 1950.0 or 2000.0). The default equatorial system is FK4 if EQUINOX or
EPOCH < 1984.0, FK5 if EQUINOX or EPOCH >= 1984.0, and FK5 if RADECSYS, EQUINOX,
and EPOCH are undefined. If RADECSYS is defined but EQUINOX and EPOCH are not,
the equinox defaults to 1950.0 for the FK4 and FK4-NO-E systems, and 2000.0 for
the FK5 system. The equinox value is interpreted as a Besselian epoch for the
FK4 and FK4-NO-E systems, and as a Julian epoch for the FK5 system. Users are
strongly urged to use the EQUINOX keyword in preference to the EPOCH keyword,
if they must enter their own equinox values into the image header. The FK4 and
FK4-NO-E systems are not inertial and therefore also require the epoch of the
observation (the time when the mean place was correct), in addition to the
equinox. The epoch is specified, in order of precedence, by the values of the
keywords MJD-WCS or MJD-OBS (which contain the modified Julian date, JD -
2400000.5, of the coordinate system), or the DATE-OBS keyword (which contains
the date of the observation in the form DD/MM/YY, CCYY-MM-DD,
CCYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.S). As the latter quantity is
only accurate to a day, the MJD-WCS or MJD-OBS specification is preferred.
If all 3 keywords are absent the epoch defaults to the value of equinox.
Equatorial coordinates in the GAPPT system require only the specification
of the epoch of observation which is supplied via the MJD-WCS, MJD-OBS,
or DATE-OBS keywords (in that order of precedence) as for the FK4 and
FK4-NO-E system.

If the image celestial coordinate systems are ecliptic the mean ecliptic
and equinox of date are required. These are read from the MJD-WCS, MJD-OBS,
or DATE-OBS keywords (in that order or precedence) as for the equatorial FK4,
FK4-NO-E, and GAPPT systems.

USERS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THE IRAF IMAGE WORLD COORDINATE SYSTEM
CURRENTLY (IRAF VERSIONS 2.10.4 PATCH 2 AND EARLIER) SUPPORTS ONLY THE
EQUATORIAL SYSTEM (CTYPE<lngax> = "RA--XXXX" CTYPE<latax> = "DEC-XXXX")
WHERE XXXX IS THE PROJECTION TYPE, EVEN THOUGH THE SKYXYMATCH TASK
SUPPORTS GALACTIC, SUPERGALACTIC, AND ECLIPTIC coordinate systems.

If \fIcoords\fR is a file name, SKYXYMATCH reads a list of x and y 
reference image world coordinates from columns \fIxcolumn\fR and \fIycolumn\fR
in the input coordinates file  and transforms these coordinates to
"native" coordinate units using the \fIxunits\fR and \fIyunits\fR parameters.
The reference image world coordinates are
transformed to logical reference and input image coordinates
using the value of the \fIwcs\fR parameter and world coordinate
information in the reference and input image headers.

SKYXYMATCH will terminate with an error if the reference and input images
are not both either 1D or 2D.
If the world coordinate system information cannot be read from either
the reference or input image header, the requested transformations
from the world <-> logical coordinate systems cannot be compiled for either
or both images, or the world coordinate systems of the reference and input
images are fundamentally incompatible in some way, the output logical
reference and input image coordinates are both set to a grid of points
spanning the logical pixel space of the input, not the reference image,
and defining an identify transformation, is written to the output file.

The computed reference and input logical and world coordinates
are written to the output file using
the \fIxformat\fR and \fIyformat\fR, \fIrwxformat\fr, \fIrwyformat\fR,
and the \fIwxformat\fR and \fIwxformat\fR
parameters respectively. If these formats are undefined and, in the
case of the world coordinates, a format attribute cannot be
read from either the reference or the input images reasonable defaults are
chosen.

If the reference and input images are 1D then the 
output logical and world y coordinates are
set to 1.

If \fIverbose\fR is "yes" then a title section is written to the output
file for each set of computed coordinates, along with messages about
what if anything went wrong with the computation.

FORMATS

A  format  specification has the form "%w.dCn", where w is the field
width, d is the number of decimal places or the number of digits  of
precision,  C  is  the  format  code,  and  n is radix character for
format code "r" only.  The w and d fields are optional.  The  format
codes C are as follows:
 
.nf
b       boolean (YES or NO)
c       single character (c or '\c' or '\0nnn')
d       decimal integer
e       exponential format (D specifies the precision)
f       fixed format (D specifies the number of decimal places)
g       general format (D specifies the precision)
h       hms format (hh:mm:ss.ss, D = no. decimal places)
m       minutes, seconds (or hours, minutes) (mm:ss.ss)
o       octal integer
rN      convert integer in any radix N

        -n      left justify in field of N characters, blank fill
        0n      zero fill at left (only if right justified)
absent, 0       use as much space as needed (D field sets precision)
 
Escape sequences (e.g. "\n" for newline):
 
\b      backspace   (not implemented)
\f      formfeed
\n      newline (crlf)
\r      carriage return
