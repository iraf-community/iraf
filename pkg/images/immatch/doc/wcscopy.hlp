NAME
wcscopy -- copy the wcs of a reference image to a list of images
.ih
USAGE
wcscopy images refimages
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
The list of input images which will inherit the wcs of the reference image.
If the image does not exists a dataless image header is created.
.le
.ls reference
The list of reference images containing the reference wcs. The number of
reference images must be one or equal to the number of input images.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print messages about the progress of the task?

DESCRIPTION

WCSCOPY copies the world coordinate system information in the header of the
reference image \fIreference\fR to the headers of the input images
\fIimages\fR, replacing any existing world coordinate system information
in the input image headers in the process. WCSCOPY assumes that the
world coordinate system information in the header of the reference 
image is accurate and that all the input images have write permission.
If the input image does not exist a data-less image header is created.
The WCS is treated as an independent object and
there is no check made on the dimensionality and sizes of the images.

EXAMPLES

1. Make sure that the world coordinates systems of a list of input images
that have been registered to a reference image with the xregister task
are identical to the world coordinate system of the reference image.

.nf
	cl> xregister @inlist refimage [200:400,200:400] shifts \
	    output=@outlist xwindow=21 ywindow=21
	cl> wcscopy @outlist refimage
.fi

2.  Create a data-less WCS image by specifying a new image.

.nf
	cl> wcscopy new dev$wpix
.fi
