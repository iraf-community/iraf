NAME
wcsctran -- use the image WCS to transform between IRAF coordinate systems
.ih
USAGE
wcsctran input output image inwcs outwcs
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input coordinate files. The number of input coordinate
files must be one or equal to the number of input images. Coordinates
may be entered by hand by setting input to "STDIN".
.le
.ls output
The list of output coordinate files. The number of coordinate files
must be one or equal to the number of input images. Results may be printed
on the terminal by setting output to "STDOUT".
.le
.ls image
The list of input images containing the WCS information.
.le
.ls inwcs, outwcs
The input and output coordinate systems. Coordinates in the input
file are assumed to be in the input system. Coordinates are written to
the output file in the output system. The options are:
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current
image. The logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by
the image input/output routines to access the image data on disk.
.le
.ls tv    
Tv coordinates are pixel coordinates used by the ximtool and saoimage
display servers.
Tv coordinates include the effects of any input image section, but
do not include the effects of previous linear transformations.
If the input image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates
are identical to logical coordinates. If the input image name does include
a section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or 
copied from a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical
coordinates.
.le
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates invariant with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image data.  For example, if the current
image was created by extracting a section of another image, the physical
coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the parent image, although the logical
coordinates will be different.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant with
respect to linear transformations of the physical image data. For example, 
the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter how the image
is linearly transformed. The default world coordinate
system is either 1) the value of the environment variable "defwcs" if
set in the user's IRAF environment (normally it is undefined) and present
in the image header, 2) the value of the "system"
attribute in the image header keyword WAT0_001 if present in the
image header or, 3) the "physical" coordinate system.
.le
.le
.ls columns = "1 2 3 4 5 6 7"
The list of columns separated by whitespace or commas in the input coordinate
file containing the coordinate values.
The number of specified columns must be greater than or equal to the
dimensionality of the input image. The coordinates are read in the
order they are specified in the columns parameter.
.le
.ls units = ""
The units of the input coordinate values, normally degrees for the sky
projection coordinate systems and angstroms for spectral coordinate
systems. 
The options are:
.ls hours
Input coordinates specified in hours are converted to decimal degrees by
multiplying by 15.0.
.le
.ls native
The internal units of the wcs. No conversions on the input coordinates
are performed.
.le

Units conversions are performed only if the input wcs is "world".
.le
.ls formats = ""
The format for the computed output coordinates. If the formats
parameter is undefined then: 1) the value of the wcs format attribute
is used if the output wcs is "world" and the attribute is defined, 2)
%g format is used with the precision set to the maximum of the precision of
the input coordinates and the value of the min_sigdigits parameter.
.le
.ls min_sigdigits = 7
The minimum precision of the output coordinates if, the formats parameter
is undefined, and the output coordinate system is "world" but the wcs
format attribute is undefined.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print comment lines to the output file as the task executes.
.le

DESCRIPTION

WCSCTRAN transforms a list of coordinates, read from  the input file
\fIinput\fR, from the coordinate system defined by \fIinwcs\fR to the
coordinate system defined by \fIoutwcs\fR using world coordinate system
information in the input image \fIimage\fR header and writes the results
to the output file \fIoutput\fR.

The input coordinates are read from and written to the
columns in the input / output file specified by the \fIcolumns\fR parameter. 
The units of the input coordinate units are assumed to be the internal
units of the coordinate system as defined in the image header, normally
degrees for sky projection coordinate systems and angstroms for
spectral coordinate systems. For convenience input coordinates in hours
are accepted and converted to decimal degrees if the \fIunits\fR parameter
is set appropriately.

The format of the output units can be set using the
\fIformats\fR parameter. If the  output formats are unspecified then the
output coordinates are written using, 1) the value of wcs format attribute if
outwcs = "world" and the attribute is defined, or, 2) the %g format and a 
precision which is the maximum of the precision of the input coordinates
and the value of the \fImin_sigdigits\fR parameter. All remaining
fields in the input file are copied to the output file without modification.

WCSCTRAN transforms coordinates from one builtin IRAF coordinate system
to another.  The builtin coordinate systems are "logical", "physical", and
"world". For convenience WCSCTRAN also supports the "tv" coordinate system
which is not a builtin IRAF system, but is used by the display server tasks
XIMTOOL, SAOIMAGE, and IMTOOL.

The \fIlogical coordinate system\fR is the pixel coordinate system of the
current image. This coordinate system is the one used by the image
input/output routines to access the image on disk. In the
logical coordinate system,
the coordinates of the pixel centers must lie within the following
range: 1.0 <= x[i] <= nx[i], where x[i] is the coordinate in dimension i,
nx[i] is the size of the image in dimension i, and the current maximum
number of image dimensions is 7. In the case of an image section,
the nx[i] refer to the dimensions of the section, not the dimensions
of the full image.

The \fItv coordinate system\fR is the pixel coordinate system used by the
display servers XIMTOOL, SAOIMAGE, and IMTOOL. 
For images which are not image sections
the tv and logical coordinate systems are identical. For images which are
image sections the tv and physical coordinate systems are identical if
the image has not undergone any prior linear transformations such as
axis flips, section copies, shifts, scale changes, rotations, etc.

The \fIphysical coordinate system\fR is the coordinate system in which the
pixel coordinates of an object are invariant to successive linear
transformations
of the image. In this coordinate system, the pixel coordinates of an object
in an image remain the same, regardless of any section copies, shifts,
rotations, etc on the image. For example, an object with the
physical coordinates (x,y) in an image would still have physical 
coordinates (x, y) in an image which is a section of the original image.

The \fIworld coordinate system\fR is the default coordinate system for the
image. The default world coordinate system is the one named by the
environment variable "defwcs" if defined in the user environment (initially
it is undefined) and present in the image header; else it is the first
world coordinate system
defined for the image (the .imh and .hhh image format support only one wcs
but the .qp format can support more); else it is the physical coordinate
system.

In most cases the number of input coordinates is equal to the number of
output coordinates, and both are equal to the dimensions of the input image.
In some cases however, the number of output coordinates may be greater or
less than the number of input coordinates. This situation occurs
if the input image has been dimensionally-reduced, i.e. is a section
of a higher-dimensioned parent image, and the input coordinate system
or the output coordinate system but not both is "logical" or "tv".
For example, if the input image is a 1D line extracted from a 2D parent
image with a sky projection world coordinate system, and the user
specifies a transformation from the "logical" to "world" systems, 
only one input coordinate (column number) is required, but two output
coordinates (ra and dec) are produced. If the input and output coordinate
systems are reversed, then two input coordinates (ra and dec) are required,
but only one output coordinate (column number) is produced. If the number of
output coordinates is less than the number of input coordinates, the extra
input coordinate columns in the input file are set to INDEF in the output file.
If the number of output columns is greater than the number of input columns,
the extra coordinate columns are added to the end of the output line.

FORMATS

A  format  specification has the form "%w.dCn", where w is the field
width, d is the number of decimal places or the number of digits  of
precision,  C  is  the  format  code,  and  n is radix character for
format code "r" only.  The w and d fields are optional.  The  format
codes C are as follows:
  
.nf

EXAMPLES

1. Find the pixel coordinates of a list of objects in an image, given a list
of their ras and decs in hh:mm:ss.s and dd:mm:ss format. Limit the precision
of the output coordinates to 3 decimal places. In this example, the input
ras and decs are assumed to be in columns 1 and 2 of the input coordinate
file, and the ras must be converted from hours to decimal degrees.

.nf
	im> wcsctran incoords outcoords image world logical units="h n" \
	    formats="%8.3f %0.3f"
.fi

2. Repeat the previous example using the same input coordinate list to
produce output coordinate lists for a list of input images.

.nf
	im> wcsctran incoords @outcoolist @imlist world logical units="h n" \
	    formats="%8.3f %8.3f"
.fi

3. Transform pixel coordinates in a photometry file to ra and dec
coordinates, writing the output coordinates in hh:mm:ss.ss and dd:mm:ss.s
format. The input pixel coordinates are stored in columns 3 and 4 of the
input coordinate file.

.nf
	im> wcsctran magfile omagfile image logical world col="3 4" \
	    formats="%12.2H %12.1h"
.fi

4. Given a set of pixel coordinates in the parent image, find the pixel
coordinates of the same objects in an image which is a shifted, rotated
and scaled version of the parent image. The input coordinate list
is created using the displayed parent image and the rimcursor task. 
The output coordinate lists is marked on the displayed transformed 
image using the tvmark task.
