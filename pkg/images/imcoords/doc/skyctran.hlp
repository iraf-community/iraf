PARAMETERS
.ls input
The source of the input coordinates. The options are:
.ls <filename>
The list of input coordinate files. Coordinates may be entered by hand by
setting input to "STDIN". A STDIN coordinate list is terminated by typing
q or <EOF> (usually <ctrl/d> or <ctrl/z>).
.le
.ls imcursor
If the input file name is equal to the reserved keyword "imcursor" the input
coordinates are read from the image cursor and the input coordinate system
is the coordinate system of the image specified by the insystem parameter.
The coordinate list is terminated by typing q or  <EOF> (usually <ctrl/d> or
<ctr/z>).
.le
.ls grid
If the input file name is equal to the reserved
keyword "grid", an \fInilng\fR by \fInilat\fR grid of equally spaced
input coordinates
is generating spanning the region defined by \fIilngmin\fR, \fIilngmax\fR,
\fIilatmin\fR, \fIilatmax\fR.

DESCRIPTION

SKYCTRAN converts coordinates in the input files
\fIinput\fR from the input celestial coordinate system \fIinsystem\fR
to the output celestial coordinate system \fIoutsystem\fR and writes the
converted coordinates to the output files \fIoutput\fR. The input
files may be simple text files, the standard input "STDIN",
the image display cursor "imcursor", or a user specified coordinate grid.
The output files may be simple
text files or the standard output "STDOUT". SKYCTRAN may be used
to change the units of the input coordinates, e.g. from degrees and degrees
to hours and degrees, to precess the coordinates, to convert from one
celestial coordinate system to another, e.g. from equatorial to ecliptic
coordinates and vice versa, and to locate common objects in
images whose fundamental coordinate systems are the same but observed at
different epochs, e.g. FK4 B1950.0 and FK4 B1975.0, or different, e.g.
equatorial FK4 B1950.0 and galactic.

The input data are read from columns \fIlngcolumn\fR, \fIlatcolumn\fR,
\fIplngcolumn\fR, \fIplatcolumn\fR, \fIpxcolumn\fR, and \fIrvcolumn\fR
in the input files and if \fItransform\fR = yes, the converted coordinates are
written to the same columns in the output files. If \fItransform\fR = "no",
the converted coordinates are appended to the input line creating two
additional columns in the output file. If the input file is the
unredirected standard input then transpose is always "no". Comment lines, blanks
lines, and lines for which the input coordinates could not be successfully
decoded are passed on to the output file without modification.

The input and output celestial coordinate systems \fIinsystem\fR and
\fIoutsystem\fR must be one of the following: equatorial, ecliptic, galactic, or
supergalactic.  The equatorial systems must be one of: 1) FK4, the mean
place pre-IAU 1976 system, 2) FK4-NO-E, the same as FK4 but without the
E-terms, 3) FK5, the mean place post-IAU 1976 system, 4) ICRS,
the International Celestial Reference System, 5) GAPPT, the geocentric
apparent place in the post-IAU 1976 system. 

If \fIinsystem\fR or \fIoutsystem\fR is an image name then the celestial
coordinate system is read from the image header. SKYCTRAN assumes that
the celestial coordinate system is represented in the image header by
the FITS keywords CTYPE, CRPIX, CRVAL, CD (or alternatively CDELT / CROTA),
RADECSYS, EQUINOX (or EPOCH), and MJD-WCS (or MJD_OBS or DATE-OBS). USERS
SHOULD TAKE NOTE THAT MJD-WCS IS CURRENTLY NEITHER A STANDARD OR
PROPOSED FUTS STANDARD KEYWORD. HOWEVER IT OR SOMETHING SIMILAR IS REQUIRED
TO SPECIFY THE EPOCH OF THE COORDINATE SYSTEM WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT
FROM THE EPOCH OF THE OBSERVATION.

The first four characters of the values of the ra/longitude and dec/latitude
axis CTYPE keywords specify the celestial coordinate system.
The permitted CTYPE values are RA--/DEC- for equatorial coordinate systems,
ELON/ELAT for the ecliptic coordinate system, GLON/GLAT for the galactic
coordinate system, and SLON/SLAT for the supergalactic coordinate system,

If the image celestial coordinate system is equatorial, the value
of the RADECSYS keyword specifies the fundamental equatorial system.
The permitted values of RADECSYS are FK4, FK4-NO-E,
FK5, ICRS, and GAPPT. If the RADECSYS keyword is not
present in the image header, the values of the EQUINOX or EPOCH keywords
in that order of precedence are used to determine the fundamental
equatorial system. EQUINOX or EPOCH contain the
epoch of the mean place and equinox for the FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, and ICRS
systems, e.g 1950.0 or 2000.0. The default equatorial system is FK4 if
EQUINOX or EPOCH < 1984.0, FK5 if EQUINOX or EPOCH >= 1984.0, and FK5 if
RADECSYS, EQUINOX and EPOCH are undefined.
If RADECSYS is defined but EQUINOX and EPOCH are not the equinox
defaults to 1950.0 for the FK4 and FK4-NO-E systems and 2000.0 for the FK5
and ICRS systems.
The equinox value is interpreted as a Besselian epoch for the FK4 and
FK4-NO-E systems and as a Julian epoch for the FK5 and ICRS systems. Users are
strongly urged to use the EQUINOX keyword in preference to the EPOCH
keyword if they must enter their own values of the equinox into
the image header. The FK4 and
FK4-NO-E systems are not inertial and therefore also require the epoch of the 
observation (the time when the mean place was correct) in addition to the
equinox.  The input coordinate system epoch of the observation is also required
if the input coordinate system is FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, or ICRS and proper motions
are supplied.
The epoch is specified, in order of precedence, by the values of
the keywords MJD-WCS or MJD-OBS containing the modified Julian date
(JD - 2400000.5) of
the coordinate system, or the DATE-OBS keyword containing
the date of the observation in the form DD/MM/YY, CCYY-MM-DD, or
CCYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.S. As the latter quantity may
only be accurate to a day, the MJD-WCS or MJD-OBS specifications are
preferable. If both
keywords are absent the epoch defaults to the value of equinox.
Equatorial coordinates in the GAPPT system require
only the specification of the epoch of observation which is supplied
via the MJD-WCS, MJD-OBS or DATE-OBS keywords as for the FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5,
and ICRS systems.

If the celestial coordinate system is ecliptic the mean ecliptic and equinox of
date are required. They are supplied via the MJD-WCS, MJD-OBS or DATE-OBS
keywords as for the equatorial FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, ICRS, and GAPPT systems.

If, the output coordinate system is galactic or supergalactic, the input
coordinate system is FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, or ICRS and proper motions are
supplied with the input coordinates, then the output epoch of the
observation is also required. This is supplied via the MJD-WCS, MJD-OBS or
DATE-OBS keywords as for the equatorial FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, ICRS, GAPPT,
and ecliptic systems.

USERS NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THE IRAF IMAGE WORLD COORDINATE SYSTEM
CURRENTLY (IRAF VERSIONS 2.10.4 PATCH 2 AND EARLIER) SUPPORTS ONLY THE
EQUATORIAL SYSTEM (CTYPE (ra axis) = "RA--XXXX" CTYPE (dec axis) = "DEC-XXXX")
WHERE XXXX IS THE PROJECTION TYPE, EVEN THOUGH THE SKYCTRAN TASK 
SUPPORTS GALACTIC, ECLIPTIC, AND SUPERGALACTIC COORDINATES.

USERS SHOULD ALSO REALIZE THAT IMAGE WORLD COORDINATE SYSTEM REPRESENTATION
IN FITS IS STILL IN THE DRAFT STAGE. ALTHOUGH SKYCTRAN TRIES TO CONFORM TO
THE CURRENT DRAFT PROPOSAL WHERE NO ADOPTED STANDARDS CURRENTLY EXIST, THE
FINAL FITS STANDARD MAY DIFFER FROM THE ONE ADOPTED HERE.

The IRAF builtin world coordinate systems "logical", "tv", "physical", and
world are also supported. This means for example that users can begin
with cursor coordinates in image 1, use the image header of image 1
to transform the pixel coordinates to the celestial coordinate system of
image 1, convert the image 1 celestial coordinates to celestial coordinates
in the image 2 celestial coordinate system, and finally transform the
celestial coordinate system 2 coordinates to pixel coordinates in image 2,
all in one step.

The \fIlogical coordinate system\fR is the pixel coordinate system of the
current image. This coordinate system is the one used by the image
input/output routines to access the image on disk. In the
logical coordinate system,
the coordinates of the pixel centers must lie within the following
range: 1.0 <= x[i] <= nx[i], where x[i] is the coordinate in dimension i,
nx[i] is the size of the image in dimension i, and the current maximum
number of image dimensions is 7. In the case of an image section,
the nx[i] refer to the dimensions of the section, not the dimensions
of the full image.

The \fItv coordinate system\fR is the pixel coordinate system used by the
display servers XIMTOOL, SAOIMAGE, and IMTOOL.
For images which are not image sections
the tv and logical coordinate systems are identical. For images which are
image sections the tv and physical coordinate systems are identical if
the image has not undergone any prior linear transformations such as
axis flips, section copies, shifts, scale changes, rotations, etc.

The \fIphysical coordinate system\fR is the coordinate system in which the
pixel coordinates of an object are invariant to successive linear
transformations
of the image. In this coordinate system, the pixel coordinates of an object
in an image remain the same, regardless of any section copies, shifts,
rotations, etc on the image. For example, an object with the
physical coordinates (x,y) in an image would still have physical
coordinates (x, y) in an image which is a section of the original image.

The \fIworld coordinate system\fR is the default coordinate system for the
image. The default world coordinate system is the one named by the
environment variable "defwcs" if defined in the user environment (initially
it is undefined) and present in the image header; else it is the first
world coordinate system
defined for the image (the .imh and .hhh image format support only one wcs
but the .qp format can support more); else it is the physical coordinate
system.

IF AN ERROR IS ENCOUNTERED WHEN DECODING THE INPUT OR OUTPUT WORLD COORDINATE
SYSTEMS, THEN AN ERROR FLAG IS PRINTED IN THE OUTPUT FILE AND ON THE STANDARD
OUTPUT IF \fIVERBOSE\fR IS YES, AND THE INPUT COORDINATES ARE COPIED TO THE
OUTPUT COORDINATES WITHOUT CHANGE.

\fIIlngunits\fR, \fIilatunits\fR, \fIolngunits\fR, and \fIolatunits\fR
set the units of the input and output coordinate systems.
If the input or output system is the <imagename> [logical/tv/physical]
system pixel units are assumed regardless of the values
of <i/o>lngunits or <i/o>latunits.  The default <i/o>lngunits and
<i/o>latunits values are
hours and degrees for the equatorial celestial coordinate system and
degrees and degrees for the remaining celestial coordinate systems.

The formats of the computed x/ra/longitude and y/dec/longitude coordinates
are specified with the \fIolngformat\fR and \fIolatformat\fR parameters.
The options are discussed in the formats section of the help page below.
If the output coordinate system is the <imagename> [logical/tv/physical],
default formats of %10.3f and %10.3f are assumed regardless
of the values of olngunits and olatunits. Otherwise default formats
of %12.3h, %12.2h, and %g are assumed for output units of "hours", "degrees",
and "radians" respectively.

EXAMPLES

1. Precess the fk4 coordinates typed in by the user to the fk5 system with
and without the proper motion values.

.nf
	cl> skyctran STDIN STDOUT fk4 fk5

	# Insystem: fk4  Coordinates: equatorial FK4
	#     Equinox: B1950.000 Epoch: B1950.00000000 MJD: 33281.92346
	# Outsystem: fk5  Coordinates: equatorial FK5
	#     Equinox: J2000.000 Epoch: J2000.00000000 MJD: 51544.50000

	# Input file: STDIN  Output file: STDOUT

	... not including proper motion
	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1
	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1 13:31:03.855  27:02:35.13

	... including proper motion
	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1 .36 -0.16
	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1 .36 -0.16 13:31:05.215  27:02:27.37

	... change the output coordinate system to fk5 1975.0 and repeat
	:os fk5 1975.0
	:os

	# Outsystem:  fk5 1975.0  Coordinates: equatorial FK5
	#     Equinox: J1975.000 Epoch: J1975.00000000 MJD: 42413.25000

	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1
	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1 13:29:53.564  27:10:17.69

	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1 .36 -0.16
	13:28:43.2 27:18:01.1 .36 -0.16 13:29:54.244  27:10:13.80

	... type EOF to quit
	<EOF>
.fi

2. Precess a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees in the FK5 system
equinox 1980.0 to equinox 2000.0 and write both the input coordinates and
the output coordinates in hours and degrees to the output file. 

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist j1980.0 j2000.0 

		... or equivalently ...

	cl> skyctran inlist outlist j1980.0 2000.0

		... or equivalently ...

	cl> skyctran inlist outlist "fk5 1980.0" fk5
.fi

Note that if the coordinate system, e.g. fk5, is not specified explicitly
then equinoxes < 1984 must be prefixed by J, or a Besselian rather than
a Julian epoch will be assumed.

3. Repeat the previous example but replace the input coordinates with
the precessed coordinates in the output file.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist j1980.0 j2000.0 transform+
.fi

4. Precess a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees in the FK4 system
equinox 1950.0 to equinox 1975.0 and write both the input coordinates and
the output coordinates in hours and degrees to the output file. The input
and output epochs of observation default to the respective equinox
values.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist 1950.0 1975.0 

		... or equivalently ...

	cl> skyctran inlist outlist b1950.0 b1975.0 

		... or equivalently ...

	cl> skyctran inlist outlist fk4 b1975.0 

		... or equivalently ...

	cl> skyctran inlist outlist fk4 "fk4 1975.0" 
.fi

5. Convert a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees in the FK4 system
equinox 1950.0 to RAS in hours and DECS in degrees in the FK5 system
equinox 2000.0, and replace the input coordinates with the
output coordinates in the output file. The Besselian epoch of the
observation is 1987.25.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist "b1950.0 1987.25" j2000.0 \
	    transform+
.fi

6. Convert a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees to RAS in degrees
and DECS in degrees, and replace the input coordinates with the output
coordinates in the output file. As the input and output coordinate systems
and equinoxes are the same no precession is performed.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist 2000.0 2000.0 olngunits=degrees \
	    transform+
.fi

7. Convert a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees in the FK4
system, equinox 1950.0, epoch of observation 1987.24, to galactic
coordinates, and write both the input and output coordinate to the
output file.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist "b1950.0 1987.25" galactic
.fi

8. Convert a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees in the FK5
system, equinox 2000.0, to ecliptic coordinates on Julian date
2449879.5, replacing the input coordinates with the converted
coordinates in the output file.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist j2000 "ecliptic 2449879.5" \
	    transform+
.fi

9. Display an image and use the cursor and image header coordinate
system, equatorial FK4, equinox 1950.0, epoch 1987.25  to print the pixel
and galactic coordinates of the marked objects on the image display.
Note that the test image dev$wpix has an incorrect value of EPOCH (0.0) that
would have confused skyctran and need to be changed.

.nf
	cl> imcopy dev$wpix wpix
	cl> hedit wpix epoch 1950.0
	cl> display wpix 1 fi+
	cl> skyctran imcursor STDOUT wpix galactic
.fi

10. Convert a list of RAS in hours and DECS in degrees measured in the
image created in example 9 to the FK5 equinox 2000.0 coordinate system.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist "wpix world" j2000.0

		   ... or equivalently ...

	cl> skyctran inlist outlist "b1950.0 1987.25" j2000.0
.fi

11. Using an image whose header coordinate system is equatorial FK5
equinox 2000.0 and a different image of the same region whose coordinate
system is galactic use the image display and cursor to create a list of
tie points in logical pixel coordinates that can be used as input to the
registration tasks geomap and geotran. Note that this example  and examples
12 and 13 below will not work on iraf system earlier than 2.11 because galactic
image header coordinates are not fully supported. They will work
however on two images which have equatorial coordinates systems
which are precessed with respect to each other.

.nf
	cl> display image1

	    ... this is the reference image

	cl> skyctran imcursor outlist image1 "image2 logical"

	    ... mark many widely scattered points on the displayed
		image image1 terminating the input list with 
		<EOF> which is usually <ctrl/z> or <ctrl/d>
.fi

12. Repeat example 11 but use a previously prepared list of image1
logical pixel coordinates as input to the task.

.nf
	cl> skyctran inlist outlist "image1 logical"\
	    "image2 logical"
.fi

13. Repeat example 11 but have skyctran automatically generate a grid
of 100 tie points.

.nf
	cl> skyctran grid outlist "image1 logical"\
	    "image2 logical"
.fi
