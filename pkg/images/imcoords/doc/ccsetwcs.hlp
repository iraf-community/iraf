NAME
ccsetwcs -- create an image wcs from a plate solution 
.ih
USAGE
ccsetwcs image database solutions
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
The input images for which the wcs is to be created.
.le
.ls database
The text database file written by the ccmap task containing the
plate solutions. If database is undefined ccsetwcs computes
the image wcs using the xref, yref, xmag, ymag, xrotation, yrotation,
lngref, latref, lngrefunits, latrefunits, and projection parameters.
.le
.ls solutions
The list of plate solutions. The number of plate solutions must be one
or equal to the number of input images.  Solutions is either a user name
supplied to the ccmap task, or the
name of the ccmap task input image for which the plate solution is valid,
or the name of the coordinate file that the ccmap task used to compute the
plate solution. The quantities stored in transform always supersede the
values of the xref, yref, xmag, ymag, xrotation, yrotation, lngref, latref,
lnrefunits, latrefunits, and projection parameters.
.le
.ls xref = INDEF, yref = INDEF
The x and y pixel coordinates of the sky projection reference point.
If database is undefined then xref and yref default to the center of the
image in pixel coordinates, otherwise these parameters are ignored.
.le
.ls xmag = INDEF, ymag = INDEF
The x and y scale factors in arcseconds per pixel. If database is undefined
xmag and ymag default to 1.0 and 1.0 arcsec / pixel, otherwise these parameters
are ignored.
.le
.ls xrotation = INDEF, yrotation = INDEF
The x and y rotation angles in degrees measured counter-clockwise with
respect to the x and y axes. Xrotation and yrotation are interpreted as the
rotation of the coordinates with respect to the x and y axes and default 0.0
and 0.0 degrees. For example xrotation and yrotation values of 30.0 and 30.0
will rotate a point 30 degrees counter-clockwise with respect to the x and y
axes. To flip the x axis coordinates in this case either set the angles to
210.0 and 30.0 degrees or leave the angles set to 30.0 and 30.0 and set the
xmag parameter to a negative value. To set east to the up, down, left, and
right directions, set xrotation to 90, 270, 180, and 0 respectively. To set
north to the up, down, left, and right directions, set yrotation to  0, 180,
90, and 270 degrees respectively. Any global rotation must be added to both the
xrotation and yrotation values.
.le
.ls lngref = INDEF, latref = INDEF
The celestial coordinates of the sky projection reference point, e.g.
the ra and dec of the reference point for equatorial systems. If database is
undefined lngref and latref default to 0.0 and 0.0, otherwise these parameters
are ignored.
.le
.ls lngunits = "", latunits = ""
The units of the lngref and latref parameters.
The options are "hours", "degrees", "radians" for the ra / longitude
coordinates, and "degrees" and "radians" for the dec / latitude coordinates.
If database is undefined then lngunits and latunits default to the preferred
units for the celestial coordinate system defined by the \fIcoosystem\fR
parameter, otherwise these parameters are ignored.
.le
.ls transpose = no
Transpose the newly created image wcs ?
.le
.ls projection = "tan"
The sky projection geometry. The most commonly used projections in
astronomy are "tan", "arc", "sin", and "lin". Other supported projections
are "ait", "car", "csc", "gls", "mer", "mol", "par", "pco", "qsc", "stg",
"tsc", and "zea".
.le
.ls coosystem = "j2000"
The celestial coordinate system. The systems of most interest to users
are "icrs", "j2000" and "b1950" which stand for the ICRS J2000.0, FK5 J2000.0,
and FK4 B1950.0 celestial coordinate systems respectively. The full set of
options are listed below. The celestial coordinate system sets the preferred
units for the lngref and latref parameters and the correct values of the image
wcs header keywords CTYPE, RADECSYS, EQUINOX, and MJD-WCS if the image header
wcs is updated.  If database is undefined the coosystem parameter is used,
otherwise this parameter is ignored.

DESCRIPTION

CCSETWCS creates an image world coordinate system from the plate solution
computed by the CCMAP task or supplied by the user, and writes it to the
headers of the input images \fIimages\fR if the \fIupdate\fR parameter is yes.

The plate solution can either be read from record \fIsolutions\fR in the
database file \fIdatabase\fR written by CCMAP, or specified by the user
via the \fIxref\fR, \fIyref\fR, \fIxmag\fR, \fIymag\fR, \fIxrotation\fR,
\fIyrotation\fR, \fIlngref\fR, \fIlatref\fR, \fIlngunits\fR, \fIlatunits\fR,
\fItranspose\fR, \fIprojection\fR, \fIcoosystem\fR and \fIpixsystem\fR
parameters.

The plate solution computed by CCMAP has the following form where x and y
are the image pixel coordinates and xi and eta are the corresponding standard
coordinates in arcseconds per pixel. The standard coordinates are computed
by applying the appropriate sky projection to the celestial coordinates.


.nf
	 xi = f (x, y)
	eta = g (x, y)
.fi

The functions f and g are either power series, Legendre, or Chebyshev
polynomials whose order and region of validity were set by the user when
CCMAP was run. The computed plate solution is somewhat arbitrary and does
not correspond to any physically meaningful model. However the linear
component of the plate solution can be given the simple geometrical
interpretation shown below.

.nf
	  xi = a + b * x + c * y
	 eta = d + e * x + f * y
	   b = xmag * cos (xrotation)
	   c = ymag * sin (yrotation)
	   e = -xmag * sin (xrotation)
	   f = ymag * cos (yrotation)
	   a = xi0 - b * xref - c * yref = xshift
	   d = eta0 - e * xref - f * yref = yshift
	   xi0 = 0.0
	   eta0 = 0.0
.fi

xref, yref, xi0, and eta0 are the origins of the pixel and standard
coordinate systems respectively. xmag and ymag are the x and y scale factors
in " / pixel and xrotation and yrotation are the rotation angles measured
counter-clockwise of the x and y axes.

If the CCMAP database is undefined then CCSETWCS computes a linear plate
solution using the parameters \fIxref\fR, \fIyref\fR, \fIxmag\fR,
\fIymag\fR, \fIxrotation\fR, \fIyrotation\fR, \fIlngref\fR, \fIlatref\fR,
\fIlngunits\fR, \fIlatunits\fR, \fItranspose\fR,  and
\fIprojection\fR as shown below. Note that in this case
xrotation and yrotation are interpreted as the rotation of the coordinates
themselves not the coordinate axes. 

.nf
	  xi = a + b * x + c * y
	 eta = d + e * x + f * y
	   b = xmag * cos (xrotation)
	   c = -ymag * sin (yrotation)
	   e = xmag * sin (xrotation)
	   f = ymag * cos (yrotation)
	   a = xi0 - b * xref - c * yref = xshift
	   d = eta0 - e * xref - f * yref = yshift
	   xi0 = 0.0
	   eta0 = 0.0
.fi

The \fItranspose\fR parameter can be used to transpose the newly created
image wcs.

If the \fIupdate\fR switch is "yes" and an input image is specified,
a new image wcs is derived from the linear component of the computed plate
solution and written to the image header. The numerical components of
the new image wcs are written to the standards FITS keywords, CRPIX, CRVAL,
and CD, with the actual values depending on the pixel coordinate system
\fIpixsystem\fR read from the database or set by the user. The FITS keywords
which define the image celestial coordinate system CTYPE, RADECSYS, EQUINOX,
and MJD-WCS are set by the \fIcoosystem\fR and \fIprojection\fR parameters.

The first four characters of the values of the ra / longitude and dec / latitude
axis CTYPE keywords specify the celestial coordinate system. They are set to
RA-- / DEC- for equatorial coordinate systems, ELON / ELAT for the ecliptic
coordinate system, GLON / GLAT for the galactic coordinate system, and
SLON / SLAT for the supergalactic coordinate system.

The second four characters of the values of the ra / longitude and dec /
latitude axis CTYPE keywords specify the sky projection geometry.
The second four characters of the values of the ra / longitude and dec /
latitude axis CTYPE keywords specify the sky projection geometry. IRAF
currently supports the TAN, SIN, ARC, AIT, CAR, CSC, GLS, MER, MOL, PAR, PCO,
QSC, STG, TSC, and ZEA standard projections, in which case the second 4
characters of CTYPE are set to  -TAN, -ARC, -SIN, etc.

If the input celestial coordinate system is equatorial, the value of the
RADECSYS keyword specifies the fundamental equatorial system, EQUINOX
specifies the epoch of the mean place, and MJD-WCS specifies the epoch
for which the mean place is correct. The permitted values of
RADECSYS are FK4, FK4-NO-E, FK5, ICRS, and GAPPT. EQUINOX is entered in years
and interpreted as a Besselian epoch for the FK4 system, a Julian epoch
for the FK5 and ICRS system. The epoch of the wcs MJD-WCS is entered as
a modified Julian date. Only those keywords necessary to defined the
new wcs are written. Any existing keywords which are not required to
define the wcs or are redundant are removed, with the exception of
DATE-OBS and EPOCH, which are left unchanged for obvious (DATE-OBS) and
historical (use of EPOCH keyword at NOAO) reasons.

If \fIverbose\fR is "yes", various pieces of useful information are
printed to the terminal as the task proceeds.

The skyctran task is used to test that the input image wcs is indeed correct.
Columns 1 and 2 contain the original ra and dec values and columns 3 and 4
contain the transformed values. The second imheader listing shows what the
image wcs looks like.


2. Repeat the previous example but enter the plate solution parameters by
hand.

Note that there are minor differences between the results of examples 1
and 2 due to precision differences in the input. Note also the difference
in the way the xrotation and yrotation angles are defined between examples
1 and 2. In example 2 the rotations are defined as coordinate rotations,
whereas in example one they are described as axis rotations.
