NAME
imsum -- sum, average, or median images
.ih
USAGE	
imsum input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Input images.
.le
.ls output
Output image.
.le
.ls title = ""
Image title for the output image.  If null ("") then the title of the
first image is used.
.le
.ls hparams = ""
List of image header parameters to be summed or averaged.  This feature
is only used when summing or averaging and no correction is made for
rejected pixels.  It is primarily used to sum exposure times.
.le
.ls pixtype = ""
Pixel datatype for the output image.  The pixel datatypes are "double",
"real", "long", "integer", "ushort", and "short" in order of precedence.
If null ("") then the calculation type is used.
The datatypes may be abbreviated to a single character.
.le
.ls calctype = ""
Calculation type.  The calculation types are "double", "real", "long",
"integer", and "short" in order of precedence.  If null ("") then the
highest precedence datatype of the input images is used.
If there is a mixture of "short" and "ushort" images then the highest
precedence datatype will be "int".
The calculation types may be abbreviated to a single character.
.le
.ls option = "sum"
Output options are "sum", "average", or "median".  The "median" of an
even number of images takes pixel nimages/2 + 1, where nimages is the
number of images.
.le
.ls low_reject = 0
If the option is sum or average then when this parameter
is less than 1 reject this fraction of low pixels from the sum or average
otherwise reject this number of low pixels from the sum or average.
.le
.ls high_reject = 0
If the option is sum or average then when this parameter
is less than 1 reject this fraction of high pixels from the sum or average
otherwise reject this number of high pixels from the sum or average.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print a log of the operation?

DESCRIPTION
The input images are summed, averaged, or medianed pixel by pixel and the
result recorded in the output image.  All input images must be the same
size but not necessarily of the same pixel datatype.  For the sum or average
option a selected fraction or number of pixels may be rejected.  The output
option "average" divides the sum by the number of pixels in the sum.  The
pixel datatype of the output image may be selected or defaulted to the
calculation datatype. The calculation type may be selected or defaulted
to the highest precedence datatype of the input images.  Note that a
mixture of "short" and "ushort" images has a highest precedence datatype
of "int".  If all the image pixel datatypes are the same and agree with the
calculation type then this operation is maximally efficient.  However,
beware of integer overflows with images of datatype short or ushort.  A log
of the task name, the input image names, the output image name, the output
pixel datatype, the output option, and the pixel rejection parameters is
printed when the verbose parameter is yes.

In addition to summing the pixels the specified image header parameters may
be summed or averaged.  This is primarily used for summing image exposure
times.  No correction is made for rejected pixels.

EXAMPLES
1. To sum three images:

.nf
	im> imsum frame1,frame2,frame3 sum hparams="itime,exposure"
.fi

2. To make a median image of a set of images:

.nf
	im> imsum obs* median option=median
.fi

where '*' is a template wildcard.

3. To reject the lowest and highest 2 pixels and average the rest:

.nf
	im> imsum obs* avg option=average low=2 high=2
.fi

.ih
REVISIONS
.ls IMSUM V2.11
Now allows "ushort" data types.
.le
.ih
TIME REQUIREMENTS
The following timings are for 512 x 512 short images in which the output
image is also short and the calculation type is short.

.nf
	    OPERATION		      CPU(sec)
	1. Sum of 3			 7.4
	2. Average of 3			13.0
	3. Median of 3			 9.9
	4. Sum of 5			13.0
	5. Median of 5			23.0
	6. Sum of middle 3 of 5		45.5
	7. Median of 7			77.8
.fi

NOTES
Any number of images may be used.  However, there is a maximum number of
images which may be open at one time.  If the number of images
(of dimension >= 2) exceeds this maximum and median or pixel rejection is
used then the performance of this task will suffer due to the need to
repeatedly open and close the excess images.  The maximum number is a
configurable parameter in the include file "imsum.h".

This task has been largely replaced by the task \fBimcombine\fR.  It is
still available but may be removed in the future.  \fBImcombine\fR is
specially designed to deal with the case of large numbers of images.
.ih
BUGS
It is an error for the output image to have the same name as an
existing image.  Beware of integer overflows when summing short images.
