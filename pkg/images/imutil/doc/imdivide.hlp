NAME
imdivide -- image division with zero checking and rescaling
.ih
USAGE	
imdivide numerator denominator resultant
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls numerator
Numerator image.
.le
.ls denominator
Denominator image.
.le
.ls resultant
Resultant image.  This image will be of datatype real.
.le
.ls title = '*'
Title for resultant image.  The special character '*' defaults the title
to that of the numerator image.
.le
.ls constant = 0
The constant value for the zero division constant option.
.le
.ls rescale = norescale
After the image division the resultant image may be rescaled with the following
options:
.ls norescale
Do not rescale the resultant image.
.le
.ls mean
Scale the resultant image to the specified mean value.
.le
.ls numerator
Scale the resultant image to have the same mean value as the numerator image.
.le
.le
.ls mean = 1
The mean value used rescale the resultant image under 'mean' option of
\fIrescale\fR.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print the means of each image?
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fInumerator\fR image is divided by the \fIdenominator\fR image to
form the \fIresultant\fR image.  The division is checked for division by
zero and replaces the result with the value of the parameter \fIconstant\fR.
After the division the resultant image may be rescaled.
The rescaling option is selected with \fIrescale\fR.  The options are
not to rescale, rescale to the specified \fImean\fR value, and rescale to
the mean of the numerator.  The means of the three images are calculated
and may be printed with the verbose option.

EXAMPLES
1. To divide a object image by a flat field and then rescale the division
back to the mean of the object image:

.nf
    cl> imdivide object image final rescale=numerator
