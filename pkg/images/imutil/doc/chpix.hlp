The pixel type of the output image. The options are: "ushort", "short",
"int", "long", "real", "double" and "complex".
.le
.ls oldpixtype = "all"
The pixel type of the input images to be converted. By default all the
images in the input list are converted to the pixel type specified by
newpixtype. The remaining options are "ushort", "short", "int", "long",

DESCRIPTION

The list of images specified by \fIinput\fR and pixel type \fIoldpixtype\fR 
are converted to the pixel type specified by \fInewpixtype\fR and written
to the list of output images specified by \fIoutput\fR.

Conversion from one pixel type to another is direct and may involve both
loss of precision and dynamic range. Mapping of floating point numbers
to integer numbers is done by truncation. Mapping of complex numbers
to floating point or integer numbers will preserve the real part of the
complex number only.

EXAMPLES

1. Convert a list of images to type real, overwriting the existing images.

        im> chpixtype nite1*.imh nite1*.imh real

2. Convert only those images in imlist1 which are of type short to type real.
   Imlist1 and imlist2 are text files containing the list of input and
   output images respectively. The image names are listed 1 per line.

        im> chpixtype @imlist1 @imlist2 real old=short
