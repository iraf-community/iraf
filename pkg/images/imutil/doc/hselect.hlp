NAME
hselect - select a subset of images satisfying a boolean expression
.ih
USAGE
hselect images fields expr
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
Images forming the set from which selected images are to be drawn.
.le
.ls fields
Template defining the fields to be tabulated from each selected image.
.le
.ls expr
The boolean expression to be used as the selection criteria.  The expression
is evaluated independently for each image.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The function of \fIhselect\fR is to select a subset of images from a database
according to a selection criteria supplied by the user, tabulating a subset
of the fields of each selected image on the standard output.  The resultant
table is output in list form, suitable for further analysis or for use to
generate a list of images to be processed by another task.

The form of the boolean expression \fIexpr\fR is fully documented in the
manual page for the \fIhedit\fR task.  In the case of \fIhselect\fR task,
however, the expression need not be parenthesized to be evaluated as an
expression.  The special operand "$I" denotes the name of the current image
and is used in the \fIfields\fR list when the image name is desired as one
of the columns of the output list.

EXAMPLES
1. Compute the mean exposure time for all the images in a database.  Note that
the argument "yes" is a trivial case of a general boolean expression and
hence need not be quoted.

	cl> hselect n1.* exp yes | average

2. Print the name, length of axes 1 and 2, and title of all two dimensional
images in a database.


.nf
	cl> hselect n1.* $I,naxis[12],title 'naxis == 2'
	n1.0001	512	512	quartz
	n1.0002 512	512	"dome flat"
	n1.0005 384	800	"ngc 3127 at 45 degrees"
	cl>
.fi


3. Produce an image name list for use to drive another task.  The selection
criterium is all images for which the value of the parameter "q-flag"
has the value 1.  Note carefully the use of quotes.  If the @ operator
is unfamiliar read the manual page for \fIhedit\fR.

	cl> hselect n1.* $I '@"q-flag" == 1' > imlist

If the parameter "q-flag" were instead named "qflag", the following
simpler expression would suffice.

	cl> hselect n1.* $I 'qflag == 1' > imlist
.ih
BUGS
Since individual image headers are currently stored as separate files,
selection from a large database is quite slow.
