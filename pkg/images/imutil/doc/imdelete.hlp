DESCRIPTION
IMDELETE takes as input a list of IRAF images specified by \fIimages\fR and
deletes both the header and pixel files. In \fIverify\fR mode IMDELETE
queries the user for the appropriate action to be taken for each IRAF image.

If the \fIimages\fR parameter is a URL, it will be accessed and put into 
the file cache, then immediately deleted.  To simply remove a file from
the cache, use the \fIfcache\fR command instead.
