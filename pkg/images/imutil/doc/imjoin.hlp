NAME
imjoin -- join images along a specified axis
.ih
USAGE
imjoin input output join_dimension 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input images to be joined. The input images must have the
same dimensionality and the same size along all dimensions but the join
dimension.
.le
.ls output
The output combined image.
.le
.ls join_dimension
The image dimension along which the input images will be joined.
.le
.ls pixtype = ""
The output image pixel type. The options are in order of increasing
precedence "s" (short), "u" (unsigned short), "i" (integer),
"l" (long integer), "r" (real), "d" (double), and "x" (complex).
If the output image pixel type is not specified, it defaults to highest
precedence input image datatype.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print messages about actions taken by the task ?

DESCRIPTION

IMJOIN creates a single output image \fIoutput\fR  by joining a list of input
images \fIinput\fR along a specified dimension \fIjoin_dimension\fR. IMJOIN
can be used to create a single long 1-dimensional image from a list of shorter
1-dimensional images, or to piece together a set of 3-dimensional images into
larger 3-dimensional images along either the x, y, or z directions. The input
images must all have the same number of dimensions and the same size along
all dimensions by the join dimension. The output image inherits the
world coordinates system if any of the first input image.

EXAMPLES

.nf
1.  Join a list of 1-dimensional spectra into a single long output spectrum.

    cl> imjoin @inlist output 1

2.  Join three datacubes along the z direction.

    cl> imjoin c1,c2,c3 c123 3

BUGS

On some systems there are limitations on the number of input images that
can be joined in a single execution of IMJOIN.
