NAME
imstack -- stack images into an image of higher dimension
.ih
USAGE	
imstack images output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
List of images to be stacked.
.le
.ls output
Name of output image created.
.le
.ls title = "*"
Title of output image.  If "*" then the title defaults to that of
the first input image.
.le
.ls pixtype = "*"
Pixel datatype of output image.  If "*" then the pixel datatype defaults to
that of the first input image.

DESCRIPTION

The input \fIimages\fR are stacked to form an \fIoutput\fR image having one
higher dimension than the input images, and a length of that dimension equal
to the number of input images.  The input images must all be of the same
dimension and size.

The output image inherits the world coordinate system (WCS) of the first
input image. If the dimension of the input image WCS is greater than or
equal to the dimension of the output image, the input WCS is copied to the
output image WCS without modification. Otherwise the input image WCS
dimension is incremented by 1 and copied to the output image WCS, the input
WCS coordinate transformations for each input image axis are copied to the
output image WCS without modification, and the new output image axis is
assigned a WCS type of 'linear' and the identity transformation.

EXAMPLES

1. Stack a set of four two dimensional images:

	cl> imstack image* image.3d

2. To stack a section of images:

	cl> imstack image*[1:10,1:10] newimage
