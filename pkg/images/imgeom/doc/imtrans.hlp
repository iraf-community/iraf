.ih
USAGE	

.nf
imtranspose input output
.fi

.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of images to be transposed.
.le
.ls output
List of output transposed images. If the output image name is the same as
the input image name then the output image will replace the input image.
The number of output images must be the same as the number of input images.
.le
.ls len_blk = 512
The one dimensional length of the transpose blocks.

DESCRIPTION
Imtranspose transposes the list of images in input by interchanging
their rows and columns and writing the results to images specified in
output. The number of input and output images must be the same.

The transpose is done in square blocks whose dimensions are equal \fIlen_blk\fR.

The imtranspose tasks can be used to perform counter-clockwise or
clockwise ninety degree rotations by flipping the y or x axis respectively
in the input image section specification.

EXAMPLES
1. To transpose an image:

.nf
	cl> imtranspose image1 image2
.fi

2. To transpose an image in place:

.nf
	cl> imtranspose image1 image1
.fi

3. To rotate an image 90 degrees counter-clockwise and clockwise:

.nf
	cl> imtranspose image1[*,-*] image2

	cl> imtranspose image1[-*,*] image2
.fi

3. To transpose a set of 3 images listed 1 per line in the file imlist to
the new images trans001, trans002, and trans003:

.nf
	cl> imtranspose @imlist trans001,trans002,trans003
.fi

4. To transpose a set of images in place:

.nf
	cl> imtranspose frame* frame*
.fi

5. To rotate an image 90 degrees counter-clockwise in place:

.nf
	cl> imtranspose image[*,-*] image
.fi
