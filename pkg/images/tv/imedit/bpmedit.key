	    BPMEDIT CURSOR KEYSTROKE COMMANDS

The following are the useful commands for BPMEDIT.  Note all
the commands for IMEDIT are available but only those shown
here should be used for editing pixel masks.
 
    ?	Print help
    :	Colon commands (see below)
    i	Initialize (start over without saving changes)
    q	Quit and save changes
    r	Redraw image display
    +	Increase radius by one
    -	Decrease radius by one
    I	Interrupt task immediately
    Q	Quit without saving changes

The following editing options are available.  Rectangular
and vector regions are specified with two positions and
aperture regions are specified by one position.  The current
aperture type (circular or square) is used in the latter
case.  All the following substitute the new value set for
the "value" parameter (see :value).  Some replace all pixels
within the mask that have the same pixel value as the value
at the cursor position.

    d 	Set rectangle to "value"
    e 	Set aperture to "value"
    u	Undo last change (see also 'i', 'j', and 'k')
    v       Set vector to "value"
    =	Replace pixels = to "cursor value" to "value"
    <	Replace pixels < or = to "cursor value" to "value"
    >	Replace pixels > than or = to "cursor value" to "value"

The colon either print the current value of a parameter when
there is no value or set the parameter to the specified
value.

command [string]	Display command
display [yes|no]	Display image?
eparam			Edit parameters
radius [value]		Aperture radius
value [value]		Constant substitution value
minvalue [value]	Minimum value for modification (INDEF=minimum)
maxvalue [value]	Maximum value for modification (INDEF=maximum)
write [name]		Write changes to name
