.le
.ls xmag = 1., ymag = 1.
Horizontal and vertical image magnifications when not filling the display
window.  Magnifications greater than 1 map image pixels into more than 1
display pixel and magnifications less than 1 map more than 1 image pixel
into a display pixel.
.le
.ls z1, z2
Minimum and maximum image intensity to be mapped to the minimum and maximum
display levels.  These values apply when not using the automatic or range
intensity mapping methods.
.le
.ls ztrans = "linear"
Transformation of the image intensity levels to the display levels.  The
choices are:
.ls "linear"
Map the minimum and maximum image intensities linearly to the minimum and
maximum display levels.
.le
.ls "log"
Map the minimum and maximum image intensities linearly to the range 1 to 1000,
take the logarithm (base 10), and then map the logarithms to the display
range.
.le
.ls "none"
Apply no mapping of the image intensities (regardless of the values of
\fIzscale, zrange, z1, and z2\fR).  For most image displays, values exceeding
the maximum display value are truncated by masking the highest bits.
This corresponds to applying a modulus operation to the intensity values
and produces "wrap-around" in the display levels.
.le
.ls "user"
User supplies a look up table of intensities and their corresponding
greyscale values.  
.le
.le
.ls lutfile = ""
Name of text file containing the look up table when \fIztrans\fR = user.
The table should contain two columns per line; column 1 contains the
intensity, column 2 the desired greyscale output.

DESCRIPTION
The specified image is loaded into the specified frame of the standard
image display device ("stdimage").  For devices with more than one
frame it is possible to load an image in a frame different than that
displayed on the monitor.  An option allows the loaded frame to become
the displayed frame.  The previous contents of the frame may be erased
(which can be done very quickly on most display devices) before the
image is loaded.  Without erasing, the image replaces only those pixels
in the frame defined by the display window and spatial mapping
described below.  This allows displaying more than one image in a
frame.  An alternate erase option erases only those pixels in the
defined display window which are not occupied by the image being
loaded.  This is generally slower than erasing the entire frame and
should be used only if a display window is smaller than the entire
frame.

The image is mapped both in intensity and in space.  The intensity is
mapped from the image pixel values to the range of display values in
the device.  Spatial interpolation maps the image pixel coordinates
into a part of the display frame called the display window.  Many of
the parameters of this task are related to these two transformations.

A display window is defined in terms of the full frame.  The lower left
corner of the frame is (0, 0) and the upper right corner is (1, 1) as viewed on
the monitor.  The display window is specified by a center (defaulted to the
center of the frame (0.5, 0.5)) and a size (defaulted to the full size of
the frame, 1 by 1).  The image is loaded only within the display window and
does not affect data outside the window; though, of course, an initial
frame erase erases the entire frame.  By using different windows one may
load several images in various parts of the display frame.

If the option \fIfill\fR is selected the image is spatially interpolated
to fill the display window in its largest dimension (with an aspect
ratio of 1:1).  When the display window is not automatically filled
the image is scaled by the magnification factors (which need not be
the same) and centered in the display window.  If the number of image
pixels exceeds the number of display pixels in the window only the central
portion of the image which fills the window is loaded.  By default
the display window is the full frame, the image is not interpolated
(no filling and magnification factors of 1), and is centered in the frame.
The spatial interpolation algorithm is described in the section
MAGNIFY AND FILL ALGORITHM.

There are several options for mapping the pixel values to the display
values.  There are two steps; mapping a range of image intensities to
the full display range and selecting the mapping function or
transformation.  The mapping transformation is set by the parameter
\fIztrans\fR.  The most direct mapping is "none" which loads the image
pixel values directly without any transformation or range mapping.
Most displays only use the lowest bits resulting in a wrap-around
effect for images with a range exceeding the display range.  This is
sometimes desirable because it produces a contoured image which is not
saturated at the brightest or weakest points.  This transformation is
also the fastest.  Another transformation, "linear", maps the selected
image range linearly to the full display range.  The logarithmic
transformation, "log", maps the image range linearly between 1 and 1000
and then maps the logarithm (base 10) linearly to the full display
range.  In the latter transformations pixel values greater than
selected maximum display intensity are set to the maximum display value
and pixel values less than the minimum intensity are set to the minimum
display value.

Methods for setting of the range of image pixel values, \fIz1\fR and
\fIz2\fR, to be mapped to the full display range are arranged in a
hierarchy from an automatic mapping which gives generally good result
for typical astronomical images to those requiring the user to specify
the mapping in detail.  The automatic mapping is selected with the
parameter \fIzscale\fR.  The automatic mapping algorithm is described
in the section ZSCALE ALGORITHM and has two parameters,
\fInsample_lines\fR and \fIcontrast\fR.

When \fIztrans\fR = user, a look up table of intensity values and their
corresponding greyscale levels is read from the file specified by the
\fIlutfile\fR parameter.  From this information, a piecewise linear
look up table containing 4096 discrete values is composed.  The text
format table contains two columns per line; column 1 contains the
intensity, column 2 the desired greyscale output.  The greyscale values
specified by the user must match those available on the output device.
Task \fIshowcap\fR can be used to determine the range of acceptable
greyscale levels.  When \fIztrans\fR = user, parameters \fIzscale\fR,
\fIzrange\fR and \fIzmap\fR are ignored.

If the zscale algorithm is not selected the \fIzrange\fR parameter is
examined.  If \fIzrange\fR is yes then \fIz1\fR and \fIz2\fR are set to
the minimum and maximum image pixels values, respectively.  This insures
that the full range of the image is displayed but is generally slower
than the zscale algorithm (because all the image pixels must be examined)
and, for images with a large dynamic range, will generally show only the
brightest parts of the image.

Finally, if the zrange algorithm is not selected the user specifies the
values of \fIz1\fR and \fIz2\fR directly.

ZSCALE ALGORITHM
The zscale algorithm is designed to display the image values near the median
image value without the time consuming process of computing a full image
histogram.  This is particularly useful for astronomical images which
generally have a very peaked histogram corresponding to the background
sky in direct imaging or the continuum in a two dimensional spectrum.

A subset of the image is examined.  Approximately 600 pixels are
sampled evenly over the image.  The number of lines is a user parameter,
\fInsample_lines\fR.  The pixels are ranked in brightness to
form the function I(i) where i is the rank of the pixel and I is its value.
Generally the midpoint of this function (the median) is very near the peak
of the image histogram and there is a well defined slope about the midpoint
which is related to the width of the histogram.  At the ends of the
I(i) function there are a few very bright and dark pixels due to objects
and defects in the field.  To determine the slope a linear function is fit
with iterative rejection;

	I(i) = intercept + slope * (i - midpoint)

If more than half of the points are rejected
then there is no well defined slope and the full range of the sample
defines \fIz1\fR and \fIz2\fR.  Otherwise the endpoints of the linear
function are used (provided they are within the original range of the
sample):

.nf
	z1 = I(midpoint) + (slope / contrast) * (1 - midpoint)
	z2 = I(midpoint) + (slope / contrast) * (npoints - midpoint)
.fi

As can be seen, the parameter \fIcontrast\fR may be used to adjust the contrast
produced by this algorithm.
.ih
MAGNIFY AND FILL ALGORITHM
The spatial interpolation algorithm magnifies (or demagnifies) the
image along each axis by the desired amount.  The fill option is a
special case of magnification in that the magnification factors are set
by the requirement that the image just fit the display window in its
maximum dimension with an aspect ratio (ratio of magnifications) of 1.
There are two requirements on the interpolation algorithm; all the
image pixels must contribute to the interpolated image and the
interpolation must be time efficient.  The second requirement means that
simple linear interpolation is used.  If more complex interpolation is
desired then tasks in the IMAGES package must be used to first
interpolate the image to the desired size before loading the display
frame.

If the magnification factors are greater than 0.5 (sampling step size
less than 2) then the image is simply interpolated.  However, if the
magnification factors are less than 0.5 (sampling step size greater
than 2) the image is first block averaged by the smallest amount such
that magnification in the reduced image is again greater than 0.5.
Then the reduced image is interpolated to achieve the desired
magnifications.  The reason for block averaging rather than simply
interpolating with a step size greater than 2 is the requirement that
all of the image pixels contribute to the displayed image.  If this is
not desired then the user can explicitly subsample using image
sections.  The effective difference is that with subsampling the
pixel-to-pixel noise is unchanged and small features may be lost due to
the subsampling.  With block averaging pixel-to-pixel noise is reduced
and small scale features still contribute to the displayed image.

EXAMPLES
For the purpose of these examples we assume a display with four frames,
512 x 512 in size, and a display range of 0 to 255.  Also consider two
images, image1 is 100 x 200 with a range 200 to 2000 and image2 is
2000 x 1000 with a range -1000 to 1000.  To load the images with the
default parameters:

.nf
	cl> cvl image1 1
	cl> cvl image2 2
.fi

The image frames are first erased and image1 is loaded in the center of
display frame 1 without spatial interpolation and with the automatic intensity
mapping.  Only the central 512x512 area of image2 is loaded in display frame 2

To load the display without any intensity transformation:

.nf
	cl> cvl image1 1 ztrans=none
.fi

The next example interpolates image2 to fill the full 512 horizontal range
of the frame and maps the full image range into the display range.  Note
that the spatial interpolation first block averages by a factor of 2 and then
magnifies by 0.512.

.nf
	cl> cvl image2 3 fill+ zscale-
.fi

The next example makes image1 square and sets the intensity range explicitly.

.nf
	cl> cvl image1 4 zscale- zrange- z1=800 z2=1200 xmag=2
.fi

The next example loads the two images in the same frame side-by-side.

.nf
	cl> cvl.xsize=0.5
	cl> cvl image1 fill+ xcen=0.25
	cl> cvl image2 erase- fill+ xcen=0.75
.fi
