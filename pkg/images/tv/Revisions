tv/imedit/epstatistics.x
    The 'x', 'y', and 'z' pointers were declared as TY_INT instead of TY_REAL
    (5/4/13, MJF)

imexamine/imexam.h
    The coordinates arrays in the main structure were improperly indexed
    with the P2R macro (2/10/11, MJF)

imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Removed some accidental code that was causing the frame number to
    be prompted for.  (12/4/08, MJF)

display/t_display.x
    The change of 8/16/07 results in the ocolors parameter being used
    in place of the bpcolors parameter.
    (8/26/08, Valdes)

display/dspmmap.x
    This was originally a copy of the code from xtools.  This is now a
    simple interface calling yt_mappm.  This supports the new WCS
    pixel mask matching.
    (1/9/08, Valdes)

    Added new parameters to specify a range of values that may be modified.
    This is mainly useful with bpmedit to selected mask values to be
    modified.  (11/16/07, Valdes)

    1.	A new option to do vector constant replacement was added.  This is
	particularly useful for editing bad pixel masks.
    2.  New options '=', '<', and '>' to replace all pixels with values
    	==, <=, or >= to the value at the cursor with the constant value
	was added.  This is useful for editing object masks.
    3.	The '?' help page is now set by an environment variable rather than
    	hardcoded to a file in lib$src.  The environment variable is
	imedit_help and is set in tv.cl to point to the file in the
	source directory.
    (8/9/07, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/maskcolor.x
    There was an error that failed to parse the color string as required.
    (8/10/07, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/sigm2.x
    Buffers were allocated as TY_SHORT but used and TY_INT.  (8/9/07, Valdes)

    1. Overlay masks are now read as integer to preserve dynamic range.
    2. Mapped color values less than 0 are transparent.
    3. A color name of transparent is allowed.
    (4/10/07, Valdes)

V2.12.2
=======

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
    The image may be specified as a template provided it match only one
    image.  (9/11/03, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    The selection of a point to get a first estimation of the FWHM in
    stf_fit did not check for the case of a zero value.  This could cause
    a floating divide by zero.  (5/5/03, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    The subpixel evaluation involves fitting an image interpolator to a
    subraster.  To avoid attempting to evaluate a point outside the center
    of the edge pixels, which is a requirement of the image interpolators,
    the interpolator is fit to the full data raster and the evaluations
    exclude the boundary pixels.  (5/5/03, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/iegnfr.x
    The test for the number of frames needed to check imd_wcsver to avoid
    trying to use more than four frames with DS9.  (1/24/03, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Added some missing braces so that if a display is not used it doesn't
    check for the number of frames to use.  This is only cosmetic at this
    time.  (1/24/03, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.1
=======

pkg/images/tv/doc/display.hlp
    Clarified what "non-zero" means in the context of masks and images
    used as masks.  (7/29/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
    Removed an unused extern declaration for ds_errfcn() which was causing
    a link failure on the alpha (6/12/02, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/tvmark/mktools.x
pkg/images/tv/tvmark/mkoutname.x
    Fixed a bug in the default output image name code that would result in
    hidden images with names like .snap.1, .snap.2, etc being written
    if the display image name included a kernel or pixel section.
    Davis (3/21/02)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
pkg/images/tv/display/imdmapping.x
    Added a check for the image name being "dev$pix" and if so prevented
    this from being expanded to the full node!prefix pathname.  Previously
    the WCS would be written with a path like 'tucana!/iraf/iraf/dev/pix'
    and would trigger an ambiguous image name error in clients like IMEXAM
    which need to readback the image name with a WCS query. (3/4/02, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/iegimage.x
    When imexmaine fails to map the image name returned by the display
    server it uses the frame buffer.  Previously there was no warning
    message about failing to map the image.  Now there is a warning.
    This is only given once until there is no error or the error message
    changes either by going to a new frame buffer or doing a new display.
    (3/4/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/iegimage.x
pkg/images/tv/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    When the frame buffer is used as the image source (when the image name
    in the display frame cannot be mapped) the final imunmap would
    attempt to unmap the same descriptor twice.  (3/1/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/iegimage.x
    The 'p' was not properly updated for the multiple WCS changes.
    (2/26/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/iegimage.x
    The changes to support multiple WCS per frame involved keeping track of
    the full WCS frame id (i.e. 101) rather than just the frame number.
    There was a minor error in this bookkeeping when incrementing the
    the next display frame to be used.  (2/19/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/sigm2.x
    The routine to compute the maximum value as the interpolated quantity
    was incorrect because the size of the input and output arrays were
    treated as the same when they are not.  This is used for overlay
    display which produced the symptom of horizontal lines.  (2/5/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/dspmmap.x
    Added the feature that the bad pixel mask or overlay mask may be
    specified by a keyword value with the syntax !<keyword>.  This is
    important for multiextension files where various masks are set
    as keywords.  The new task OBJMASKS also writes the object mask name
    that is created for an image in the header.  Use of !objmask then
    allows the object mask to be used for the bad pixel mask (to set
    the scaling using only sky pixels) and for overlay.  (2/5/02, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imedit/epimcopy.x
    Added a missing TY_USHORT branch to the image copy routines.
    (10/10/01, LED)

pkg/images/tv/display/imdgetwcs.x
pkg/images/tv/display/imdputwcs.x
pkg/images/tv/display/imdsetwcs.x
    Modified to allow read/write of the additional mapping information
    during WCS i/o.  If the iis_version flag is non-zero and a valid mapping
    exists, the set/put wcs routines will automatically format the WCS text
    to include this information, otherwise it writes the old WCS text.  If
    iis_version is non-zero and a server query returns mapping information
    this will be stored in the iis common for later retrieval by the
    imd_getmapping() routine.  (06/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/imdwcsver.x
	Removed 'frame' number argument form the procedure.  The procedure
    will now map frame one if no connection is already opened and query the
    WCS.  Returns non-zero if the server is capable of using the new mapping
    structures.  Required to be called explicitly by programs using mappings
    to initialize the imd interface for this functionality.  (06/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
	Removed earlier addition of ds_setwcs() function since this is now
    handled by the standard imd_putwcs() interface.  Mapping information
    is set prior to the WCS write with imd_setmapping().  (06/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/mkpkg
	Updated dependencies (06/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/imdmapping.x		+
	New routines imd_[sg]etmapping() allow a program to set the
    mapping to be sent with the next imd_putwcs() call, or retrieve the
    mapping info sent by the server with the last wcs query.  The calls
    are no-ops if the connected server doesn't know about the new
    mappings, imd_getmapping() is an integer function which returns
    non-zero if a valid mapping is available.  A new imd_query_map() is
    available to return the mapping information for a given WCS number.
    The intent is that the mapping can be obtained for a wcs returned by a
    cursor read, e.g. to get the image name associated with the mapping.
    (6/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/iis.com
	Added new variables to the IIS common to hold the mapping
    information for each WCS write.  In order to preserve the imd interfaces
    it was necessary to save the mappings in the common, along with a flag
    indicating whether the connected server can use them. (06/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/iisopn.x
    Added initialization of the iis_version value at device open time
    (6/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/gwindow.h
    Removed struct element W_WCSVER added earlier, no longer needed.
    (6/21/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
    Replaced call to alogr with direct call to log10 to avoid having to
    define and error function for the vops operator.  (6/15/01, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/sigm2.x
    Removed extra arguments in amaxr call.  (6/15/01, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/dspmmap.x
    Added missing arguments to mw_ctrand.  (6/15/01, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/dspmmap.x
    Fixed problems with ds_match.  The new version is more robust and
    correct.  A bad pixel for the displayed image is the maximum of all
    pixels in the pixel mask which fall within the display pixel.   This
    version still does not allow any relative rotations but does allow
    non-integer offsets.  (4/24/01, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
pkg/images/tv/display/imdgetwcs.x
pkg/images/tv/display/imdwcsver.x
pkg/images/tv/display/iis.h
    Compatability fixes for the new WCS strings and "old" servers.  The
    WCS version query is now carried out with a read request using the old
    WCS data size (320) to avoid blocked reads from old servers not sending
    the 1024-char data.  imd_getwcs() was modified to query the server for
    the version before the actual wcs query and the request is made with the
    appropriate size.  In the case of a WCS query the IIS 'x' register is
    used to signal that the new format is being used, the WCS version is
    passed back if the 'y' register is non-zero.  Neither of these registers
    was used by the old protocol, the new ximtool checks these registers and
    responds by using the correct WCS buffer size.  (03/12/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
    Removed the code which stripped the path-prefix and section from
    the image name displayed in the title string.  This was originally
    done to save space but confuses tasks like IMEXAM which rely on
    this to map the image.  (02/26/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/iis.h	
    Somehow the SZ_WCSTEXT value got reset to 320, this was causing
    a problem with TVMARK redrawing the display.  Reset to 1024.
    (02/26/01, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
    Changes to detect and use new WCS strings (12/04/00, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/gwindow.h
    Added struct element W_WCSVER (12/04/00, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/iis.h
    Added definitions for 16-frame support, increased the size of
    the SZ_WCSTEXT to 1024 (12/04/00, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/mkpkg 
pkg/images/tv/display/imdwcsver.x     	+
    Added a routine which does a WCS query with the X register set
    to check whether the server can handle the new WCS strings.  If
    the reply is "version=<num>" we use the new stuff, otherwise it's
    a no-op and we use the old format strings. (12/04/00, MJF)

pkg/images/tv/display/t_display.x
    Fixed an off-by-one error in WCS sent to the display when the display
    buffer is smaller than the image.  (9/5/00, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imexamine/t_imexam.x
pkg/images/tv/imexamine/timexam.x	+
pkg/images/tv/imexamine/iecolon.x
pkg/images/tv/imexamine/mkpkg
pkg/images/tv/imexamine.par
pkg/images/tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
lib/scr/imexamine.key
    Added new key 't' to ouput an image section centered on the cursor.
    (9/2/00, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/dspmmap.x
    Masks were being copied internally in short which would truncate masks
    having larger values.  (5/16/00, Valdes)

=========
V2.11.3p2
=========

pkg/images/tv/imedit/t_imedit.x
pkg/images/tv/imedit/epimcopy.x
    Added some errchks.  In particular, even though the output and working
    images can be mapped without an error there could be an error in the
    first I/O as when the imdir directory is not available/writeable.
    (1/18/00, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/imedit/t_imedit.x
    The use of a temporary image causes the output image type to be
    set by "imtype" instead of any explicit extension.  Changed to
    use the xt_mkimtemp routine which tries to create a temporary image
    of the desired output image type.  (10/1/99, Valdes)

pkg/images/tv/display/mkpkg
pkg/images/tv/wcslab/mkpkg
pkg/images/tv/imedit/mkpkg
pkg/images/tv/imexamine/mkpkg
    Added some missing file dependencies and removed some unecessary ones
    from the package mkpkg files.
    (9/21/99 LED)

pkg/images/tv/wcslab/wcslab.h
    Added an entry for tnx to the list of supported projection types.
    tnx image sometimes produced garbled plots, especially for ra ~0.0.
    (9/17/99 LED)

pkg/images/tv/wcslab/t_wcslab.x
pkg/images/tv/wcslab/wcslab.x
    Fixed a couple of bugs in the wcslab task that were causing it to fail with
    the message "ERROR: MWCS: coordinate system not defined (physical)" on the
    Dec Alpha when the usewcs parameter was set to yes, and on Sun systems when
    the input image was undefined. The problems were a bad call to the
    routine mw_swtype in the routine wl_decode_ctype and a missing check
    for the image = "" case. (8/28/99 LED)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

images$tv/display/sigm2.x
    An argument to sigm2_setup was being changed by the routine and this
    changed argument was then incorrectly used by the calling program.
    The argument was made input only.  (6/15/99, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iepos.x
    The output of the 'x' and 'y' keys was not being written to the log
    file because of a typo.  (5/7/99, Valdes)

images$tv/display/t_display.x
    Added checks for a data range of zero, or which rounds to zero for
    short data, to avoid floating divide by zero errors.  Rather than
    resort to a unitary transformation in this case the requested
    data range minimum is decreased by one and the maximum is increased
    by one.  (8/11/98, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    The logic in STF_FIT for determining the points to fit and the point
    to use for the initial width estimate was faulty allowing some bad
    cases to get through.  (7/31/98, Valdes)

images$tv/imedit/epix.h
images$tv/imedit/t_imedit.x
images$tv/imedit/epcolon.x
images$tv/doc/imedit.hlp
    The temporary editing buffer image was made into a unique temporary
    image rather than the fixed name of "epixbuf".  (6/30/98, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.1
=======

images$tv/imexamine/iepos.x
     Added missing argument in fprintf call.  (8/29/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/dspmmap.x
     There was a bug in the code which gives "Warning: PLIO: reference out
     of bounds on mask".  This was introduced with the changes to allow
     masks and images to have different binning.  (8/21/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ieqrimexam.x	+
images$tv/imexamine/t_imexam.x
images$tv/imexamine/iegcur.x
images$tv/imexamine/iecolon.x
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
lib/scr/imexamine.key
    Added two new keystrokes, ',' and '.', that do what 'a' and 'r' do
    except they don't do the enclosed flux and direct FWHM measurements nor
    iterate on the fitting radius.  Also the output format is the same as
    the previous version of IMEXAM.  (6/12/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    1.  The background is now set to zero if there are no background points.
    2.  Fixed an error recovery bug (attempting to free a pointer which
	was not set).
    (6/11/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
    The background widths needed to be passed to the PSF measuring routines
    even if the background is turned off for the fitting in the 'a' and 'r'
    keys.  (6/11/97, Valdes)

images$tv/doc/display.hlp
    Added some more information about the colors.  (5/30/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/dspmmap.x
    Improved to allow different binning between masks and images.
    (5/21/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/zscale.x
    Fixed to work with 1D images.  (5/21/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/zscale.x
images$tv/display/dspmmap.x
    1. Now works with higher dimensional images (displays the first band)
       and with image sections.
    2. Now ignores error when the image has an unknown WCS type.  The
       WCS is mapped to determine the physical coordinate transformation
       for use with masks but this failed when someone imported an image
       with the CAR projection type. (4/30/97, Valdes)

images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Reversed the order of the version and task in the revisions section.
    (4/22/97, Valdes)

images$tv/tvmark/mkmark.x
    Made sure that object the label was set to "" in the call to the
    mk_onemark procedure inside the a keystroke command. The lack
    of initialization was causing tvmark to fail when the coordinates
    file did not exist at task startup time and the label parameter
    was set to "yes". (4/17, LED)

images$tv/imedit/epgsfit.x
    The earlier change failed to setup the x/y arrays for the surface fitting.
    This was fixed.  (4/15/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iejimexam.x
images$tv/imexamine/iecolon.x
images$tv/kimexam.par +
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
images$tv/tv.cl
    Added a pset for the 'k' key rather than sharing with the 'j' key.  This
    was confusing to users since it was the only key without it's own pset.
    Also there may be some reason to have the fitting parameters be
    different along lines and columns.  (4/11/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
images$doc/imexamine.hlp
    The log output for 'a' or 'r' has one line per measurement as in
    previous versions.  The standard output, however, uses two lines to
    print nicely on 80 column windows.  (4/1/97, Valdes)

images$tv/rimexam.par
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Changed the zero point of the magnitude scale from 30.0 to 25.0.
    (3/31/97, Davis)

images$tv/display/mkpkg
images$tv/doc/display.hlp
    1.  Improved the structure of DISPLAY.
    2.  Fixed coordinate system errors.
    3.  Added parameters to display bad pixel masks and overlay masks.
    4.  The z scaling sampling may use a pixel mask or image section.
    5.  The z scaling excludes bad pixels.
    (3/20/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/imdmapfr.x
images$tv/display/imdputwcs.x +
    Added two routines to hide knowledge of the channel structure and
    other details from the calling routines.  (12/11/96, Valdes)

images$tv/display/iishdr.x
images$tv/display/iisers.x
    Replaces SPP int -> short assignments by calls to achtiu because of
    overflow problems with some VMS fortran compilers.
    (12/6/96, Valdes as reported by Zarate)

images$tv/display/t_display.x
    1.  Fixed numerous problems with the coordinate system.
    2.  Fixed a bug in how ztrans=log was done.
    (12/5/96, Valdes)

images$tv/display/sigm2.x	+
    Added a version of the spatial interpolation routines that allows masks
    to interpolate the input across bad pixels. (12/5/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imedit/epgsfit.x
images$tv/imedit/epcolon.x
images$tv/doc/imedit.hlp
images$tv/imedit/imedit.par
    Added a median background if the xorder or yorder is zero.
    (11/22/96, Valdes)

wcslab$t_wcslab.x
doc$wcslab.hlp
    Added an "overplot" option to append to a plot but with a different
    viewport.  (11/06/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
    No change but the date got updated.  (10/14/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    Fixed bug in evaluation of enclosed flux profile in which the scaled
    radius was used for the gaussian subtraction stage instead of pixels.
    This does not currently affect IMEXAM because the scale is fixed
    at 1.  (8/29/96, Valdes)

images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Removed reference to pset for kimexam.  (5/31/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    Fixed incorrect datatype declaration "real np" -> "int np" in various
    related places.  (4/9/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imedit/epsearch.x
images$tv/imedit/epgcur.x
    1.  The search algorithm produced incorrect results if part of the aperture
    	was off the edge (negative image coordinates).
    2.  The rounding was incorrect when part of the aperture was off the
	edge (negative image coordinates).
    3.  A floating operand error occurs when a key is given without
	coordinates.

    The radial profile fitting and width measurements now have an option to
    use a Gaussian or Moffat profile model.  The model is selected by a
    new "fittype" parameter.  A new "beta" parameter may be specified as
    INDEF to be determined from the fit or have a fixed value.  The Moffat
    profile model does better in producing consistent FWHM values so
    this is the default.  There is also a new "iterations" parameter
    to allow iteratively adjusting the fitting radius.
    The STARFOCUS code used to compute other parameters was updated to
    use a Moffat model and a new method for measuring the FWHM directly
    from the radially average profile.  (3/22/96, Valdes)

    Changed the defaults to radius=5, buffer=5, width=5.  A related change

    New FWHM estimates based on the enclosed flux and a direct measurement
    were added to the 'a' and 'r' keys.  The weights for the Gaussian

    1.	The "label" parameter was incorrectly attributed to the surface plot
	instead of the contour plot.
    2.  The "axes" parameter for the surface plot was missing in the code
	though noted in the help.
    3.	Updated the help and key file to show the label parameter belongs

    Replaced a seek to EOF call with a flush call in the the tvmark task add
    object procedure. On SunOS systems the seek to EOF was apparently forcing
    the flush while on Solaris systems it was not, resulting in the added
    objects never being written to the coordinate file.

    for list of previous revisions to these tasks.

    The IIS dependent tasks BLINK, CV, CVL, ERASE, FRAME, LUMATCH,
    MONOCHROME, PSEUDOCOLOR, RGB, WINDOW and ZOOM were removed from
    the TV package and placed in the new subpackage TV.IIS.

    The directory structure of the IIS package was modified.

    Valdes, June 6, 1990
    The fixpix format input was selecting interpolation across the longer
    dimension instead of the shorter.  This meant that complete columns
    or lines did not work at all.

====
V2.8

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 29, 1990
    Even when use_display=no the task was trying to check the image display
    for the name.  This was fixed by adding a check for this flag in the
    relevant if statement.

noao$proto/imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 22, 1990
    The pset was being closed without indicating this in the data structure.
    The clcpset statement was removed.

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 15, 1990
    The EOF condition was being screwed up for two keystroke commands leading
    to a possible infinite loop when using a cursor file input.  The fix
    is to change the "nitems=nitems+clgcur" incrementing to simply
    "nitems=clgcur".

    1. The surfit pointer was incorrectly declared as real in ep_bg causing the
    'b' key to do nothing.  This appears to be SPARC dependent.
    2. Fixed some more problems with cursor strings having missing coordinates
    causing floating overflow errors.

noao$proto/imexamine/iecolon.x

    1. Fixed typo in prompt string for y background order.
    2. Wrong datatype in clput for order parameters resulting in setting
       the user parameter file value to 0.
    3. Bug fix in epmask.  The following is the correct line:
       line 130:    call amovi (Memi[line], Memi[ptr2+i*EP_NX(ep)], EP_NX(ep))

noao$proto/imedit/epdisplay.x
    Valdes, Jan 7, 1990
    Added initialization to the zoom state.  Without the intialization
    starting IMEDIT without display and then turning display on followed by

    1. Tvmark has been modified to permit deletion as well as addition of
    objects to the coordinate file. Objects to be deleted are marked
    with the cursor and must be within a given tolerance of an
    object in the coordinate list to be deleted.
    2. The help screen no longer comes up in the text window when the task
    is invoked for the sake of uniformity with all other IRAF tasks.
    3. The coordinate file is opened read_only in batch mode. In interactive
    mode a warning message is issued if the user tries to append or delete
    objects from a file which does not have write permission and no action
    is taken.

    1. There was no check against INDEF cursor coordinates.  Such coordinates
    will occur when reading a previous logfile output and cursor input

       user's changes if an error occurs.
    2. If no background points are found an error message is now printed
       instead of aborting.

noao$proto/tvmark/mkbmark.x
    Davis, Aug 4, 1989
    Modified tvmark so that drawing to the frame buffer is more efficient
    in batch mode. This involved removing a number of imflush calls
    which were unnecessarily flushing the output buffer to disk and
    recoding the basic routines which draw concentric circles and rectangles.
