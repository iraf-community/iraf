images$tv/imexamine/iepos.x
     Added missing argument in fprintf call.  (8/29/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/dspmmap.x
     There was a bug in the code which gives "Warning: PLIO: reference out
     of bounds on mask".  This was introduced with the changes to allow
     masks and images to have different binning.  (8/21/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ieqrimexam.x	+
images$tv/imexamine/t_imexam.x
images$tv/imexamine/iegcur.x
images$tv/imexamine/iecolon.x
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
lib/scr/imexamine.key
    Added two new keystrokes, ',' and '.', that do what 'a' and 'r' do
    except they don't do the enclosed flux and direct FWHM measurements nor
    iterate on the fitting radius.  Also the output format is the same as
    the previous version of IMEXAM.  (6/12/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    1.  The background is now set to zero if there are no background points.
    2.  Fixed an error recovery bug (attempting to free a pointer which
	was not set).
    (6/11/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
    The background widths needed to be passed to the PSF measuring routines
    even if the background is turned off for the fitting in the 'a' and 'r'
    keys.  (6/11/97, Valdes)

images$tv/doc/display.hlp
    Added some more information about the colors.  (5/30/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/dspmmap.x
    Improved to allow different binning between masks and images.
    (5/21/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/zscale.x
    Fixed to work with 1D images.  (5/21/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/zscale.x
images$tv/display/dspmmap.x
    1. Now works with higher dimensional images (displays the first band)
       and with image sections.
    2. Now ignores error when the image has an unknown WCS type.  The
       WCS is mapped to determine the physical coordinate transformation
       for use with masks but this failed when someone imported an image
       with the CAR projection type. (4/30/97, Valdes)

images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Reversed the order of the version and task in the revisions section.
    (4/22/97, Valdes)

images$tv/tvmark/mkmark.x
    Made sure that object the label was set to "" in the call to the
    mk_onemark procedure inside the a keystroke command. The lack
    of initialization was causing tvmark to fail when the coordinates
    file did not exist at task startup time and the label parameter
    was set to "yes". (4/17, LED)

images$tv/imedit/epgsfit.x
    The earlier change failed to setup the x/y arrays for the surface fitting.
    This was fixed.  (4/15/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iejimexam.x
images$tv/imexamine/iecolon.x
images$tv/kimexam.par +
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
images$tv/tv.cl
    Added a pset for the 'k' key rather than sharing with the 'j' key.  This
    was confusing to users since it was the only key without it's own pset.
    Also there may be some reason to have the fitting parameters be
    different along lines and columns.  (4/11/97, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
images$doc/imexamine.hlp
    The log output for 'a' or 'r' has one line per measurement as in
    previous versions.  The standard output, however, uses two lines to
    print nicely on 80 column windows.  (4/1/97, Valdes)

images$tv/rimexam.par
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Changed the zero point of the magnitude scale from 30.0 to 25.0.

    1.  Improved the structure of DISPLAY.
    2.  Fixed coordinate system errors.
    3.  Added parameters to display bad pixel masks and overlay masks.
    4.  The z scaling sampling may use a pixel mask or image section.
    5.  The z scaling excludes bad pixels.
    (3/20/97, Valdes)

images$tv/display/imdmapfr.x
images$tv/display/imdputwcs.x +
    Added two routines to hide knowledge of the channel structure and
    other details from the calling routines.  (12/11/96, Valdes)

images$tv/display/iishdr.x
images$tv/display/iisers.x
    Replaces SPP int -> short assignments by calls to achtiu because of
    overflow problems with some VMS fortran compilers.
    (12/6/96, Valdes as reported by Zarate)

images$tv/display/t_display.x
    1.  Fixed numerous problems with the coordinate system.
    2.  Fixed a bug in how ztrans=log was done.
    (12/5/96, Valdes)

images$tv/display/sigm2.x	+
    Added a version of the spatial interpolation routines that allows masks
    to interpolate the input across bad pixels. (12/5/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imedit/epgsfit.x
images$tv/imedit/epcolon.x
images$tv/doc/imedit.hlp
images$tv/imedit/imedit.par
    Added a median background if the xorder or yorder is zero.
    (11/22/96, Valdes)

wcslab$t_wcslab.x
doc$wcslab.hlp
    Added an "overplot" option to append to a plot but with a different
    viewport.  (11/06/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
    No change but the date got updated.  (10/14/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    Fixed bug in evaluation of enclosed flux profile in which the scaled
    radius was used for the gaussian subtraction stage instead of pixels.
    This does not currently affect IMEXAM because the scale is fixed
    at 1.  (8/29/96, Valdes)

images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Removed reference to pset for kimexam.  (5/31/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
images$tv/imexamine/stfmeasure.x
    Fixed incorrect datatype declaration "real np" -> "int np" in various
    related places.  (4/9/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imedit/epsearch.x
images$tv/imedit/epgcur.x
    1.  The search algorithm produced incorrect results if part of the aperture
    	was off the edge (negative image coordinates).
    2.  The rounding was incorrect when part of the aperture was off the
	edge (negative image coordinates).
    3.  A floating operand error occurs when a key is given without
	coordinates.
    (3/26/96, Valdes)

lib$scr/imexamine.key
    The radial profile fitting and width measurements now have an option to
    use a Gaussian or Moffat profile model.  The model is selected by a
    new "fittype" parameter.  A new "beta" parameter may be specified as
    INDEF to be determined from the fit or have a fixed value.  The Moffat
    profile model does better in producing consistent FWHM values so
    this is the default.  There is also a new "iterations" parameter
    to allow iteratively adjusting the fitting radius.
    The STARFOCUS code used to compute other parameters was updated to
    use a Moffat model and a new method for measuring the FWHM directly
    from the radially average profile.  (3/22/96, Valdes)

images$tv/rimexam.par
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Changed the defaults to radius=5, buffer=5, width=5.  A related change
    is being made to STARFOCUS, PSFMEASURE, KPNOFOCUS to attempt to
    produce similar values by default.  (3/13/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iejimexam.x
images$tv/jimexam.par
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    Bug 330: There were several errors in this which only show up when
    using a world WCS.  The parameter prompt and help now indicate the
    initial sigma value is in pixels even when fitting in world
    coordinates.  (2/27/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iemw.x
    The inverse WCS function was incorrect and is fixed.  (2/27/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x

images$tv/imexamine/starfocus.h +
images$tv/imexamine/mkpkg
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
lib$src/imexamine.key
    New FWHM estimates based on the enclosed flux and a direct measurement
    were added to the 'a' and 'r' keys.  The weights for the Gaussian
    fit were modified to reduce the influence of pixels outside the
    half-maximum radius.  The ? help and help page were revised to
    described the new output and algorithms.  (11/9/95+12/8/95+3/14/96, Valdes)

images$tv/imedit/t_imedit.x
images$doc/imedit.hlp
    The 'j', 'k', 'n', and 'u' keys were added to those recorded in the
    logfile.  (4/11/95, Valdes)

images$doc/imexamine.hlp
    Fixed a typo in the equation for ellipticity.  (4/10/95, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iejimexam.x
    Fixed a pointer addressing error found by Zarate.  (2/16/95, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/iecolon.x
images$tv/doc/imexamine.imh
lib$src/imexamine.key
    1.	The "label" parameter was incorrectly attributed to the surface plot
	instead of the contour plot.
    2.  The "axes" parameter for the surface plot was missing in the code
	though noted in the help.
    3.	Updated the help and key file to show the label parameter belongs
	to the e plot and to show the axes parameter.
    (11/8/94, Valdes)

images$tv/tvmark/mkmark.x
    Replaced a seek to EOF call with a flush call in the the tvmark task add
    object procedure. On SunOS systems the seek to EOF was apparently forcing
    the flush while on Solaris systems it was not, resulting in the added
    objects never being written to the coordinate file.
    (10/3/94, Davis)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
    World coordinates printed in the 'r' profile graph are now formated.
    (8/2/94, Valdes)

images$tv/wcslab/wcslab.x
    Fixed an initialization bug in wcslab that was causing the axis labels
    of the plot to be drawn incorrectly the first time wcslab was run. 
    This was only a bug under 2.10.3
    (26/7/94 Davis)

images$tv/imexamine/iestatistics.x
    Changed the statistics routine to compute quantities in double precision.
    (3/10/93, Valdes)

images$tv/imexamine/ierimexam.x
images$tv/doc/imexamine.hlp
    The simple gaussian fitting was inadequate and gave biased answers.
    Replaced this algorithm with NLFIT version.  It is still just a two
    parameter fit with the center and sky being determined and then fixed
    as before.  (3/2/93, Valdes)

images$tv/wcslab/wcslab.h
images$tv/wcslab/wcs_desc.h
images$tv/wcslab/wcslab.x
images$tv/wcslab/wlwcslab.x
    Removed a dependency on the file gio.h from the wcslab task.
		(2/11/93 LED)

images$tv/wcslab/wcs_desc.h
images$tv/wcslab/wcslab.h
images$tv/wcslab/wcslab.x
images$tv/wcslab/wlwcslab.x
    Removed several dependences on the file gio.h which were no longer
    required. There is still one remaining dependency. (2/11/93, Davis)

images$tv/wcslab/wcslab.x
    Fixed a bug in the axis mapping code in wcslab which was causing the
    task to fail in some circumstances if the input image was a section
    of a higher dimensioned parent image. (1/28/93, Davis)

=======
V2.10.2
=======

images$imexamine/iejimexam.x
    Changed aint to nint.  (8/10/92, Valdes)

images$imexamine/iegdata.x
    For some reason (typo?) the test for out-of-bounds pixels was such that
    a single column or line at the edge of the image was considered out of
    bounds.  The >= test was changed to >.  (7/31/92, Valdes)

images$*imexam.par
images$imexamine/*
images$doc/imexamine.e
    Made modifications to use coordinate formating in graphs and in
    cursor readback.  Also the WCS label will be used if label="wcslabel".
    Two paramters were added to the main PSET, xformat and yformat.
    (4/10/92, Valdes)

images$tv/wcslab.x
    Wcslab was failing if an image larger than the frame buffer was
    displayed with fill=no.
    (3/25/92, Davis)

images$tv/imexamine/iemw.x
    The logical coordinate of an excluded axis is 1 and not axval+1.
    (3/9/92, Valdes)

images$tv/wcslab/wlwcslab.x
    Replaced the routine wl_unused_wcs which searched for an unused wcs
    with some code to save and replace the current wcs.

    (2/18/92, Davis)

images$tv/
    Moved all the .keys files from the noao$lib/scr/ and proto$tvmark/ 
    directories to the iraf$lib/scr/ directory.

    (1/29/92, Davis)

images$tv/wcslab/
    Added the new task WCSLAB developed at ST by Jonathan Eisenhammer
    and modified at NOAO to the TV package.

    (1/24/92, Davis)

images$tv/
    
    New version of the TV package created.

    The IMEDIT, IMEXAMINE, and TVMARK tasks were removed from the old
    NOAO.PROTO package and added to the IMAGES.TV package. See below
    for list of previous revisions to these tasks.

    The IIS dependent tasks BLINK, CV, CVL, ERASE, FRAME, LUMATCH,
    MONOCHROME, PSEUDOCOLOR, RGB, WINDOW and ZOOM were removed from
    the TV package and placed in the new subpackage TV.IIS.

    The directory structure of the IIS package was modified.

noao$proto/
proto$imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Corrected an error in the column limits computation in the routine
    ie_get_vector that caused occasional glitches in vectors plotted
    using the 'v' key. This bug may also explain occasional unrepeatable
    bus errors which occurred after using the 'v' key. (12/11/91, Davis)

proto$imedit/epcolon.x
    Two calls to pargr changed to pargi.  (11/13/91, Valdes)

proto$tvmark/t_tvmark.x
proto$tvmark/mkcolon.x
    Removed extra argument to mk_sets() calls. (11/13/91, Davis)

    Modified IMEXAMINE to use WCS information in axis labels and coordinate
    readback.  (8/13/91, Valdes)

proto$tvmark/mkonemark.x
    Moved the two salloc routines to the top of the mk_onemark routine
    where they cannot be called more than once.
    (7/22/91, Davis)

proto$tvmark.par
    Modified the description of the pointsize parameter.
    (7/17/91, Davis)

proto$imexamine/iesimexam.x
    Add code for checking and warning if data is all constant, all above the
    specified ceiling, or all below the specified floor when making surface
    plots.  (10/3/90, Valdes)

proto$imedit/epmask.x
    Added some protective changes so that if a radius of zero with a circular
    aperture is used then round off will be less likely to cause missing
    the pixel.  (9/23/90, Valdes)

proto$tvmark/tvmark.key
proto$tvmark/mkmark.x
proto$tvmark/doc/tvmark.hlp
    At user request changed the 'd' keystroke command  which marks an object
    with a dot to the '.' and the 'u' keystroke command which deletes a
    point to 'd'. (9/14/90 Davis)

====
V2.9
====

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, June 6, 1990
    The fixpix format input was selecting interpolation across the longer
    dimension instead of the shorter.  This meant that complete columns
    or lines did not work at all.

====
V2.8
====

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 29, 1990
    Even when use_display=no the task was trying to check the image display
    for the name.  This was fixed by adding a check for this flag in the
    relevant if statement.

noao$proto/imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 22, 1990
    The pset was being closed without indicating this in the data structure.
    The clcpset statement was removed.

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 15, 1990
    The EOF condition was being screwed up for two keystroke commands leading
    to a possible infinite loop when using a cursor file input.  The fix
    is to change the "nitems=nitems+clgcur" incrementing to simply
    "nitems=clgcur".

noao$proto/imedit/epbackground.x
noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 9, 1990
    1. The surfit pointer was incorrectly declared as real in ep_bg causing the
    'b' key to do nothing.  This appears to be SPARC dependent.
    2. Fixed some more problems with cursor strings having missing coordinates
    causing floating overflow errors.

noao$proto/imexamine/iecolon.x
    Valdes, Feb 16, 1990
    Fixed a mistake in the the datatype of a parg call.

noao$proto/imedit.par
noao$proto/imedit/epcolon.x
noao$proto/imedit/epmask.x
    Valdes, Jan 17, 1990
    1. Fixed typo in prompt string for y background order.
    2. Wrong datatype in clput for order parameters resulting in setting
       the user parameter file value to 0.
    3. Bug fix in epmask.  The following is the correct line:
       line 130:    call amovi (Memi[line], Memi[ptr2+i*EP_NX(ep)], EP_NX(ep))

noao$proto/imedit/epdisplay.x
    Valdes, Jan 7, 1990
    Added initialization to the zoom state.  Without the intialization
    starting IMEDIT without display and then turning display on followed by
    a 'r' would cause an error (very obscure but found in a demo).

    Davis, Dec 12, 1989
    1. Tvmark has been modified to permit deletion as well as addition of
    objects to the coordinate file. Objects to be deleted are marked
    with the cursor and must be within a given tolerance of an
    object in the coordinate list to be deleted.
    2. The help screen no longer comes up in the text window when the task
    is invoked for the sake of uniformity with all other IRAF tasks.
    3. The coordinate file is opened read_only in batch mode. In interactive
    mode a warning message is issued if the user tries to append or delete
    objects from a file which does not have write permission and no action
    is taken.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
noao$proto/imexamine/iegimage.x
    Valdes, Nov 30, 1989
    The default display frame when not using an input list was changed from
    0 to 1.

noao$proto/imeidt/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Oct 30, 1989
    1. There was no check against INDEF cursor coordinates.  Such coordinates
    will occur when reading a previous logfile output and cursor input
    where the shorthand ":command" is used.  The actual error occured when
    attempting to add 0.5 to INDEF.

    Valdes, Aug 17, 1989
    1. Added errchk to main cursor loop to try and prevent loss of the
       user's changes if an error occurs.
    2. If no background points are found an error message is now printed
       instead of aborting.

noao$proto/tvmark/mkbmark.x
    Davis, Aug 4, 1989
    Modified tvmark so that drawing to the frame buffer is more efficient
    in batch mode. This involved removing a number of imflush calls
    which were unnecessarily flushing the output buffer to disk and
    recoding the basic routines which draw concentric circles and rectangles.
