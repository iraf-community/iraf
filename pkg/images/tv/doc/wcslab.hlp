NAME
wcslab -- overlay a labeled world coordinate grid on an image

.ih
USAGE
wcslab image

.ih
PARAMETERS

.ls image 
The name of the image to be labeled. If image is "", the parameters
in wcspars will be used to draw a labeled coordinate grid.
.le
.ls frame
The display frame buffer displaying the image to be labeled.
.le
.ls usewcs = no
Use the world coordinate system specified by the parameters in the wcspars
parameter set in place of the image world coordinate system  or if
image is "" ?
.le
.ls wcspars = ""
The name of the parameter set defining the world coordinate system
to be used if image is "" or if usewcs = "yes".  The wcspars parameters
are described in more detail below.
.le
.ls wlpars = "" 
The name of the parameter set which controls the
detailed appearance of the plot. The wlpars parameters are described
in more detail below.
.le
.ls fill = yes
If fill is no, wcslab tries to
create a square viewport with a maximum size dictated by the viewport
parameters.  If fill is yes, then wcslab
uses the viewport exactly as specified.
.le
.ls vl = INDEF, vr = INDEF, vb = INDEF, vt = INDEF
The left, right, bottom, and top edges of the viewport in NDC (0-1)
coordinates. If any of vl, vr, vb, or vt are  INDEF,
wcslab computes a default value. To overlay the plot
with a displayed image, vl, vr, vb, and vt must use the same viewport used
by the display task to load the image into the frame buffer.
.le
.ls overplot = no
Overplot to an existing plot?  If yes, wcslab will not erase the
current plot.  This differs from append in that a new viewport
may be defined.  Append has priority if both
append and overwrite are yes.
.le
.ls append = no
Append to an existing plot?  If no, wcslab resets the
graphics to a new viewport/wcs for each new plot.  Otherwise, it uses
the scaling from a previous plot. If append=yes but no plot was drawn, it
will behave as if append=no.   This differs from overplot in that
the same viewport is used.  Append has priority if both
append and overwrite are yes.
.le
.ls device = "imd"
The graphics device. To create an overlay plot, device must be set
to one of the imdkern devices listed in dev$graphcap. To create a 
plot of the coordinate grid in the
graphics window, device should be set to "stdgraph".
.le

DESCRIPTION

WCSLAB draws a labeled world coordinate grid on the graphics device
\fIdevice\fR using world coordinate system (WCS)
information stored in the header of the IRAF image \fIimage\fR if
\fIusewcs\fR is "no", or
in \fIwcspars\fR if \fIusewcs\fR is "yes" or \fIimage\fR is "".
WCSLAB currently supports the following coordinate system types 1)
the tangent plane, sin, and arc sky projections in right ascension
and declination and 2) any linear coordinate system.

By default WCSLAB draws on the image display device, displacing
the currently loaded image pixels with graphics pixels. Therefore in order
to register the coordinate grid plot with the image, the image must
loaded into the image display with the DISPLAY task, prior to
running WCSLAB.

If the viewport parameters \fIvl\fR, \fIvr\fR, \fIvb\fR, and
\fIvt\fR are left undefined, WCSLAB will try to match the viewport
of the coordinate grid plot with the viewport of the currently
displayed image in the selected frame \fIframe\fR. 
This scheme works well in the case where \fIimage\fR is smaller
than the display frame buffer, and in the case where \fIimage\fR is
actually a subsection of the image currently loaded into the display frame
buffer.  In the case where \fIimage\fR
fills or overflows the image display frame buffer, WCSLAB 
draws the appropriate coordinate grid but is not able to draw the
titles and labels which would normally appear outside the plot.
In this case the user must, either adjust the DISPLAY parameters
\fIxmag\fR, and \fIymag\fR so that the image will fit in the frame
buffer,  or change the DISPLAY viewport parameters \fIxsize\fR and
\fIysize\fR so as to display only a fraction of the image.

WCSLAB can create a new plot each time it is run, \fIappend\fR = no
and \fIoverplot\fR = no,  add a new graph to an existing plot
if \fIoverplot\fR = yes and \fIappend\fR=no,
or append to an existing plot if \fIappend\fR = yes. 
For new or overplots WCSLAB computes the viewport and window, otherwise it
uses the viewport and window of a previously existing plot. If \fIdevice\fR
is "stdgraph", then WCSLAB will clear the screen between each new plot.
This is not possible if \fIdevice\fR is one of the "imd" devices
since the image display graphics kernel writes directly into the display
frame buffer. In this case the user must redisplay the image and rerun
WCSLAB for each new plot.

The parameters controlling the detailed appearance of the plot
are contained in the parameter set specified by \fIwlpars\fR.

.ih
THE USER-DEFINED WCS

The parameters in WCSPARS are used to define the world
coordinate system  only if,  1) the parameter \fIusewcs\fR is "yes"
or, 2) the input image is undefined.
This user-defined WCS specifies the transformation from the logical coordinate
system, e.g.  pixel units, to a world system, e.g. ra and dec.

Currently IRAF supports two types of world coordinate systems:
1) linear, which provides a linear mapping from pixel units to
the world coordinate system 2) and the sky projections which provide
a mapping from pixel units to ra and dec.  The parameters
\fIctype1\fR and \fIctype2\fR define which coordinate system will be in
effect.  If a linear system is
desired, both \fIctype1\fR and \fIctype2\fR must be "linear".
If the tangent plane sky projection is desired,
and the first axis is ra and the
second axis is dec, then \fIcypte1\fR and \fIctype2\fR
must be "ra---tan" and "dec--tan" respectively.
To obtain the sin or arc projections "tan" is replaced with "sin" or
"arc" respectively.

The scale factor and rotation between the logical and world coordinate
system is described by the CD matrix.  Using matrix
multiplication, the logical coordinates are multiplied by the CD
matrix to produce the world coordinates.  The CD matrix is represented in
the parameters as follows:

.nf

                |---------------|
                | cd1_1  cd1_2  |
                |               |
                | cd2_1  cd2_2  |
                |---------------|

.fi

To construct a typical CD matrix, the following definitions of the
individual matrix elements may be used:

.nf

        cd1_1 =  xscale * cos (ROT)
        cd1_2 = -yscale * sin (ROT)
        cd2_1 =  xscale * sin (ROT)
        cd2_2 =  yscale * cos (ROT)

.fi

where xscale and yscale are the scale factors from the logical to world
systems, e.g. degrees per pixel, and ROT is the angle of rotation between
the two systems, where positive rotations are counter-clockwise.

The ra/dec transformation is a special case.  Since by convention ra
increases "to the left", opposite of standard convention, the first axis
transformation needs to be multiplied by -1.  This results in the
following formulas: 

.nf

        cd1_1 = -xscale * cos (ROT)
        cd1_2 =  yscale * sin (ROT)
        cd2_1 =  xscale * sin (ROT)
        cd2_2 =  yscale * cos (ROT)

.fi

Finally, the origins of the logical and world systems must be defined.
The parameters \fIcrpix1\fR and \fIcrpix2\fR define the coordinate in
the logical space that corresponds to the coordinate in world space
defined by the parameters \fIcrval1\fR and \fIcrval2\fR. The coordinates
(crpix1, crpix2) in logical space, when transformed to world space,
become (crval1, crval2).

The last set of parameters, log_x1, log_x2, log_y1, log_y2, define the
region in the logical space, e.g. in pixels,  over which the transformation
is valid.

.ih
AXIS SPECIFICATION

For all \fIlinear\fR transformations axis 1 and axis 2 specify which axis in
the image is being referred to.
For example in a 2-dimensional image, the FITS image header keywords
CTYPE1, CRPIX1, CRVAL1, CDELT1,
CD1_1, and CD1_2 define the world coordinate transformation for axis 1.
Similarly the FITS image header keywords
CTYPE2, CRPIX2, CRVAL2, CDELT2,
CD2_1, CD2_2, define the world coordinate transformation for axis 2.

THIS RULE DOES NOT APPLY TO THE TANGENT PLANE, SIN, and ARC SKY
PROJECTION WCS'S.
For this type of WCS axis 1 and axis 2 
always refer to right ascension and declination respectively,
and WCSLAB assumes that all axis 1 parameters refer to right
ascension and all axis 2 parameters refer to declination, regardless of
which axis in the image WCS actually specifies right ascension and declination.

.ih
GRID DRAWING 

There are two types of grid lines / tick marks, "major" and
"minor".  The major grid lines / tick marks are the lines / ticks
that will be labeled.  The minor grid lines / tick marks are plotted
between the major marks.  Whether lines or tick marks are drawn is
determined by the boolean parameters \fImajor_grid\fR and \fIminor_grid\fR.
If yes, lines are drawn; if no, tick marks are drawn.  How the lines
appear is controlled by the parameters \fImajor_line\fR and \fIminor_line\fR.

The spacing of minor marks is controlled by the parameters \fIaxis1_minor\fR
and \fIaxis2_minor\fR. These parameters specify the number of minor marks
that will appear between the major marks along the axis 1
and axis 2 axes.

Spacing of major marks is more complicated.  WCSLAB tries to
present major marks only along "significant values" in the
coordinate system.  For example, if the graph spans several hours of
right ascension,  the interval between major marks will in general be an
hour and the major marks will appear at whole hours within the graph.
If what WCSLAB chooses is unacceptable, the interval and range can
be modified by the parameters \fIaxis1_int\fR, \fIaxis1_beg\fR,
\fIaxis1_end\fR for the axis 1, and \fIaxis2_int\fR, \fIaxis2_beg\fR,
and \fIaxis2_end\fR for axis 2. All three parameters must be specified for
each axis in order for the new values to take affect

.ih
GRAPH APPEARANCE

WCSLAB supports three types of graph: normal, polar, and near_polar.

A normal graph is the usual Cartesian graph where lines of constant
axis 1 or 2 values cross at least two different sides of the graph.
WCSLAB will by default plot a normal type graph for any image 1)
which has no defined WCS 2) which has a linear WCS 3) where the sky
projection WCS approximates a Cartesian system.

A polar graph is one in which the north or south pole of the
coordinate system actually appears on the graph.
Lines of constant declination are no longer approximately
straight lines, but are circles which may not intersect any
of the edges of the graph. In this type of graph, axis 1 values
are labeled all the way around the graph. 
Axis 2 values are labeled within the graph
next to each circle.  An attempt is made to label as many circles as
possible.  However, if the WCSLAB's defaults are not agreeable,
the parameters, \fIaxis2_dir\fR and \fIjustify\fR, can be modified
to control how this labeling is done.
\fIAxis2_dir\fR specifies along which axis 1 value the
axis 2 labels should be written.  \fIJustify\fR specifies on which side of
this value the label should appear.

The near_polar graph is a cross between the normal graph and the polar
graph.  In this case the pole is not on the graph, but is close enough
to significantly affect the appearance of the plot.  The near_polar graph
is handled like a polar graph.

The parameter \fIgraph_type\fR can be used to force WCSLAB
to plot a graph of the type specified, although in this case it
may be necessary to modify the values of other WLPARS parameters to
obtain pleasing results. For example trying to plot a polar graph as
Cartesian may producing a strange appearing graph.

.ih
GRAPH LABELING

Due to the variety of graph types that can be plotted (see above), and
the arbitrary rotation that any WCS can have, the task of labeling
the major grid lines in a coherent and pleasing manner is not trivial.

The basic model used is the Cartesian or normal graph.  Labels
normally appear on the left and bottom edges of the graph with a side
devoted solely to one of the WCS coordinate axis.  For example, right
ascension might be labeled only along the bottom edge of the graph
and declination only along the left edge, or vice versa. 

If the defaults chosen by WCSLAB are unacceptable, the
parameters \fIaxis1_side\fR and \fIaxis2_side\fR, can be used to specify which
side (or sides) the labels for axis 1 and axis 2 will appear.
Either a single side or a list of sides can be specified for either
axis.  If a list is specified, labels will appear on each side listed,
even if the same side appears in both of the parameters.  In this way,
labels can be made to appear on the same side of the graph.

.ih
LABEL APPEARANCE

Due to coordinate rotations, lines of constant axis 1 or axis 2 value
may not intersect the edges
of the graph perpendicularly.  To help clarify which line belongs to
which label, the labels will be drawn at an angle equal to that of the
line which is being labeled.  If this is not desired, 
the parameter \fIrotate\fR may be set to no, and labels will always appear
"normal", i.e.  the text will not be rotated in any way.

By default, all labels will be shortened to the smallest unit
needed to indicate the value of the labeled line.  For example, if the
graph spans about 30 seconds of declination, the interval between the
labels will be approximately 5 or 10 seconds. The first label will contain the
full specification, i.e. -22:32:20.  But the rest of the labels will
only be the seconds, i.e. 30, 40, 50.  However, at the change in
minutes, the full format would be used again, -22:33:00, but then
again afterwards only seconds will be displayed, i.e. 10, 20, etc.
If this shortening of labels is undesirable, it
can be turned off by setting the parameter \fIfull_label\fR to yes.  This
forces every label to use the full specification.

Finally, the parameter \fIlabel_size\fR can be used to adjust the size of the
characters used in the axis labels.

.ih
TITLES

A graph title may specified using the parameter \fItitle\fR. If \fItitle\fR
= "imtitle" a default title constructed from the image name and title
is used. The location and size of the graph title are controlled by
the parameters \fItitle_side\fR and \fItitle_size\fR.
Similarly the content, placement and size of the axis titles are
controlled by the parameters \fIaxis1_title\fR, \fIaxis2_title\fR,
\fIaxis1_title_side\fR, \fIaxis2_title_side\fR,  and
\fIaxis_title_size\fR.

.ih
OUTPUT FORMATS

If \fIremember\fR = yes, the coordinates are output to the parameter set
WLPARS in a form suitable for the type of system the coordinates
represent.  For example right
ascensions are output in HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds) and
declinations are output in DD:MM:SS (degrees:minutes:seconds).
If the input parameters are changed, for example axis1_int, their values
must be input in the same format.
If the WCS is linear, then the parameters will not be formatted in any special
way; i.e. no assumptions are made about units, etc.

EXAMPLES

1. Display the 512 pixel square IRAF test image dev$pix in an 800 square
display window and overlay it with a labeled coordinate grid.  Since
dev$pix  does not have a defined WCS a pixel coordinate grid will appear.

.nf
	cl> display  dev$pix 1

	    ... display the image in frame 1

	cl> wcslab dev$pix 1

	    ... the coordinate grid in green will be plotted on the display
.fi

2. Redisplay the previous image and by overlay the labeled
coordinate grid on the inner 100 by 400 pixels in x and y.

.nf
	cl> display dev$pix 1

	    ... erase the graphics by redisplaying the image

	cl> wcslab dev$pix[100:400,100:400] 1
.fi

3. Display an 800 square image which has a defined linear WCS in an 800 square
display window and overlay it with the coordinate grid. Reduce
the display viewport in order to leave space around the edge of the
displayed image for the labels and titles.

.nf
	cl> display image 1 xsize=0.8 ysize=0.8 fill+
	cl> wcslab image 1 vl=.1 vr=.9 vb=.1 vt=.9
.fi

4. Repeat the previous example using a different combination of display
and wcslab parameters to achieve the same goal.

.nf
	cl> display image 1 xmag=0.8 ymag=0.8
	cl> wcslab image 1
.fi

5. Display a section of the previous image and overlay it with a
coordinate grid. Note that the same section should be specified in
both cases.

.nf
	cl> display image[101:700,101:700] 1
	cl> wcslab image[101:700,101:700] 1
.fi

6. Display a 512 square image with a defined tangent plane sky projection
in an 800 square frame buffer and overlay the labeled coordinate grid. The 
standard FITS keywords shown below define the WCS. This WCS is
approximately correct for the IRAF test image dev$pix.
