NAME
bpmedit -- examine and edit bad pixel masks associated with images
.ih
USAGE
bpmedit images
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
List of images whose bad pixel masks are to be edit.  The images must
contain the keyword BPM whose value is an existing bad pixel mask to
be edit.  If the keyword is missing or the mask does not exit a warning
is issued and the task proceeds to the next image.
.le
.ls bpmkey = "BPM"
The mask to be edited is defined by the value of this keyword.
.le
.ls frame = 1
The display frame where the image with the mask overlay is shown.
.le
.ls refframe = 2
The display frame with the image without the mask is shown.
.le
.ls command = "display ..."
Command for displaying and updating the mask overlay.  This is the
command used with \fBimedit\fR.  This should be changed with care.
In the string the following changes are made:

.nf
    $image -- substitute the image
     $mask -- substitute the mask being edited
    $frame -- substitute the value of the frame parameter
    $erase -- substituted by imedit
.fi
.le

.ls display = yes
Use the task interactively with the display?  This sets the behavior
of \fBimedit\fR as described for the parameter of the same name.
.le
.ls cursor = ""
Image cursor input.  This is normally either a null string for interactive
display editing or the value of a file with cursor commands to edit
non-interactively.  See the help for \fBimedit\fR for more information.
.le

.ih
ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS

This task calls \fBdisplay\fR to load the image display and \fBimedit\fR
to do the editing.  The current default parameters are used from those
tasks except the image names, frames, and the display command are set by
this task.  Also the search radius is set to zero (i.e. no centering).
Also the \fIdisplay\fR and \fIcursor\fR parameters override the
values of the parameters of the same name in \fBimedit\fR.  Of particular
note is the default value for imedit.value which defines the mask value to
be set initially.  This value may be changed interactively in \fBimedit\fR.
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fBBpmedit\fR is a variant of \fBimedit\fR.  It displays the input images
with the masks overlaid.  The mask is defined
by the value of the keyword keywords specified by the \fIbpmkey\fR
parameter.  The editing commands apply to the mask overlay and not the
image pixels.  In this application the edited values should be integer mask
values.  In the usual case where zero indicates good pixels and non-zero
indicates bad pixels one can set and unset values by changing current
replacement value with ":value".  Two useful parameters, ":minvalue"
and ":maxvalue", are useful in this context to allow editing only
specific ranges of mask values.  Note that many of the imedit options are
not useful for mask editing.  The '?' keystroke prints a list of the
useful cursor and colon commands.  This list is also shown below.

Because it is common to want to see the image pixels to which the
mask values apply this task loads two image display frames.  In one the
mask is overlaid and changes to the mask are updated with the
redisplay options of imedit (note the options to turn on and off
automatic redisplay).  In the second the image without the mask is
displayed.  The editing commands may be given in either frame but the
mask updates will appear only in the mask overlay frame.

This task also provides the parameters \fIdisplay\fR and \fIcursor\fR
to use \fBimedit\fR in a non-interactive manner as described for that
task.  Because only the setting and clearing of rectangles, circles,
or vectors makes sense with this task this may not be of great use.
Also there are many other tasks that can be used to edit masks
non-interactively.

Please read the help for \fBimedit\fR for details of the editing
process.

.nf
		BPMEDIT CURSOR KEYSTROKE COMMANDS

    The following are the useful commands for BPMEDIT.  Note all
    the commands for IMEDIT are available but only those shown
    here should be used for editing pixel masks.
     
	?	Print help
	:	Colon commands (see below)
	i	Initialize (start over without saving changes)
	q	Quit and save changes
	r	Redraw image display
	+	Increase radius by one
	-	Decrease radius by one
	I	Interrupt task immediately
	Q	Quit without saving changes

    The following editing options are available.  Rectangular
    and vector regions are specified with two positions and
    aperture regions are specified by one position.  The current
    aperture type (circular or square) is used in the latter
    case.  All the following substitute the new value set for
    the "value" parameter (see :value).  Some replace all pixels
    within the mask that have the same pixel value as the value
    at the cursor position.

	d 	Set rectangle to "value"
	e 	Set aperture to "value"
	u	Undo last change (see also 'i', 'j', and 'k')
	v       Set vector to "value"
	=	Replace pixels = to "cursor value" to "value"
	<	Replace pixels < or = to "cursor value" to "value"
	>	Replace pixels > than or = to "cursor value" to "value"


		BPMEDIT COLON COMMANDS

    The colon either print the current value of a parameter when
    there is no value or set the parameter to the specified
    value.

    aperture [type]	 Aperture type (circular|square)
    autodisplay [yes|no] Automatic image display?
    command [string]	 Display command
    display [yes|no]	 Display image?
    eparam		 Edit parameters
    radius [value]	 Aperture radius
    value [value]	 Constant substitution value
    minvalue [value]	 Minimum value for modification (INDEF=minimum)
    maxvalue [value]	 Maximum value for modification (INDEF=maximum)
    write [name]	 Write changes to name
