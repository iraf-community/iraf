NAME
imexamine -- examine images using image display, plots, and text
.ih
USAGE
imexamine [input [frame]]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Optional list of images to be examined.  If specified, images are examined
in turn, displaying them automatically.  If no images are specified the
images currently loaded into the image display are examined.
.le
.ls output = ""
Rootname for output images created with the 't' key.  If no name is specified
then the name of the input image is used.  A three digit number is appended
to the rootname, such as ".001", starting with 1 until no image is found with
that name.  Thus, successive output images with the same rootname will be
numbered sequentially.
.le
.ls ncoutput = 101, nloutput = 101
Size of the output image created with the 't' key which is centered on the
position of the cursor.
.le
.ls frame = 1
During program execution, a query parameter specifying the frame to be loaded.
May also be specified on the command line when \fIimexamine\fR is used as a
task to display a new image, to specify the frame to be loaded.
.le
.ls image
Query parameter for selecting images to be loaded.
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Logfile filename in which to record output of the commands producing text.
If no filename is given then no logfile will be kept.
.le
.ls keeplog = no
Log output results initially?  Logging can be toggled interactively during
program execution.
.le
.ls defkey = "a"
Default key for cursor x-y input list.  This key is applied to input
cursor lists which do not have a cursor key specified.  It is used
to repetitively apply a cursor command to a list of positions typically
obtained from another task.
.le
.ls autoredraw = yes
Automatically redraw graphs after a parameter change?  If no then graphs
are only drawn when a graph or redraw command is given.
If yes then colon commands which modify a parameter of the last graph
will automatically redraw the graph.  A common example of this would
be changing the graph limits.
.le
.ls allframes = yes
Use all frames for displaying images?  If set, images from the input list
are loaded cycling through the available frames.  If not set the last frame
loaded is reused.
.le
.ls nframes = 0
Number of display frames.  When automatically loading images from the input
list only this number of frames will be used.  This should, of course,
not exceed the number of frames provided by the display device.
If the number of frames is set to 0 then the task will query the display
device to determine how many frames are currently allocated.  New frames may
be allocated during program execution by displaying images with the 'd' key.
.le
.ls ncstat = 5, nlstat = 5
The statistics command computes values from a box centered on the
specified cursor position with the number of columns and lines
given by these parameters.
.le
.ls graphcur = ""
Graphics cursor input.  If null the standard graphics cursor is used whenever
graphics cursor input is requested.  A cursor file in the appropriate
format may be substituted by specifying the name of the file.
.le
.ls imagecur = ""
Image display cursor input.  If null the standard image display cursor is
used whenever image cursor input is requested.  A cursor file in the
appropriate format may be substituted by specifying the name of the file.
Also the image cursor may be changed to query the graphics device or
the terminal by setting the environment parameter "stdimcur"
to "stdgraph" or "text" respectively.
.le
.ls wcs = "logical"
The world coordinate system (\fIwcs\fR) to be used for axis labeling when
input is from images.
The following standard world systems are predefined.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are image pixel coordinates relative to the image currently
being displayed.
.le
.ls physical
The physical coordinate system is invariant with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image matrix.  For example, if the reference
image was created by extracting a section of another image, the physical
coordinates of an object in the reference image will be the pixel coordinates
of the same object in the original image.  The physical coordinate system
thus provides a consistent coordinate system (a given object always has the
same coordinates) for all images, regardless of whether any user world
coordinate systems have been defined.
.le
.ls world
The "world" coordinate system is the \fIcurrent default WCS\fR.
The default world system is the system named by the environment variable
\fIdefwcs\fR if defined in the user environment and present in the reference
image WCS description, else it is the first user WCS defined for the image
(if any), else physical coordinates are returned.
.le
.ls xformat = "", yformat = ""
The numerical format for the world coordinate labels in the line and column
plots and the format for printing world coordinates.  The values may be ""
(an empty string), %f for decimal format, %h and %H for xx:xx:xx format, and
%m and %M for xx:xx.x format.  The upper case %H and %M convert degrees
to hours.  Images sometimes include recommended coordinate formats as
WCS attributes.  These are used if the format specified by these parameters
is "".  Any other value will override the image attribute.
.le

In addition to these three reserved WCS names, the name of any user WCS
defined for the reference image may be given.  A user world coordinate system
may be any linear or nonlinear world system.
.le
.ls graphics = "stdgraph"
Graphics output device.  Normally this is the standard graphics device
specified by the environment variable "stdgraph".
.le
.ls display = "display(image='$1',frame=$2)"
Command template used to display an image.  The image to be displayed is
substituted for argument $1 and the frame for argument $2.  Any display task
may be used for image display by modifying this template.
.le
.ls use_display = yes
Use the image display?  Set to no to disable all interaction with the
display device, e.g., when working at a terminal that does not provide image
display capabilities.
.le
.ih
ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
The various graphs and the aperture sum command have parameters defined in
additional parameter sets.  The parameter sets are hidden tasks with
the first character being the cursor command graph key that uses the

DESCRIPTION
Images are examined using an image display, various types of plots, and
text output.  Commands are given using the image display cursor and/or
graphics cursor.  This task brings together many of the features of the
IRAF image display and graphics facilities with some simple image
analysis capabilities.

IMAGE DISPLAY

If \fIuse_display\fR is yes the image display is used to examine images.
When no input list is specified images may be loaded with the 'd' key,
frames selected with 'n', 'p', and ":select", and the scaled contents
of the display frame buffer examined if the image itself is not available.

When an input list is specified the 'n', 'p', and ":select" allow
moving about the list and new images may be added to the end of the
list with 'd'.  Images are automatically loaded as they are selected if
not currently loaded.  Two parameters control how the frames are
loaded.  The \fInframes\fR parameter determines which frames are
available.  Within the available frames images may be loaded by cycling
through them if \fIallframes\fR is yes or in the last loaded frame
(initially frame 1) if it is no.

When reading the image cursor the frame and the name of the image in
the frame are determined.  Therefore images may also be selected
by changing the frame externally or if the image cursor input is
changed from the standard image display to text or file input.

The 'd' command displays an image using the template CL command given
by parameter \fIdisplay\fR.  Usually this is the standard
IRAF \fBtv.display\fR command though in some circumstances other commands
like \fBplot.contour\fR may be used.  This command may be used to
display an image even if \fIuse_display\fR is no.

This task is generally intended for interactive use with an image
display.  However it is possible to disable use of the image display
and change the image cursor input to a graphics cursor, a file,
or typed in by the user.  In this case an input image list is most
appropriate but if one is missing, a query will be issued each time
a command requiring an image is given.

CURSOR INPUT

Commands are given using cursor input.  Generally the image cursor is
used to select points in the images to be examined and the key typed
selects a particular operation.  In addition to the image cursor the
graphics cursor is sometimes useful.  First, it gives access to the
graphics cursor mode commands (see \fBcursors\fR) such as annotating,
saving or printing a graph, expanding and roaming, and printing cursor
positions.  Second, it can give a better perspective on the data for
cursor positions than the image cursor.  And lastly, it may be needed
when an image display is not available.  The commands 'g' and 'i'
select between the graphics and image cursors.  Initially the image
cursor is read.

Interpretation of the graph coordinate in terms of an image coordinate
depends on the type of graph as described below.

.ls contour plot
This gives image coordinates directly and both the x and y cursor values
are used.
.le
.ls column plot
The x cursor position gives the line coordinate and the column coordinate
used for the plot (that specified before averaging) gives the column
coordinate.
.le
.ls line plot
The x cursor position gives the column coordinate and the line coordinate
used for the plot (that specified before averaging) gives the line
coordinate.
.le
.ls vector plot
The x cursor position defines a column and line coordinate along the vector
plotted.
.le
.ls surface plot
No cursor information is available in this plot and the cursor position
used to make the surface plot (the center of the surface) is used again.
.le
.ls histogram plot
No cursor information is available in this plot and the cursor position
used to make the histogram (the center of the box) is used again.
.le
.ls radial profile plot
No cursor information is available in this plot and the cursor position
used to define the center is used again.
.le

There are some special features associated with cursor input in IRAF
which might be useful in some circumstances.  The image display cursor
can be reset to be a text cursor, graphics cursor, or image cursor by
setting the environment variable "stdimcur" to "text", "stdgraph",
or "stdimage" respectively.  Text cursor input consists of the x and
y coordinates, a frame number, and the key or colon command.  Another
form of text input is to set the value of the cursor input parameter
to a file containing cursor commands.  There are two special features
dealing with text cursor input.  If only x and y are entered the default
key parameter \fIdefkey\fR determines the command.  This is particularly
useful if one has a list of pixel positions prepared by some other
program.  The second feature is that for commands not requiring coordinates
they may be left out and the command key or colon command entered.

TEXT OUTPUT

The following commands produce text output which may also be appended to
a logfile.

.ls a, ','
Circular aperture photometry is performed at the position of the cursor.
If the centering option is selected the cursor position is used as the
initial point for computing the central moments of the marginal
distributions in x and y.  The marginal distributions are obtained from a
square aperture with edge dimensions of twice the aperture radius
parameter.  Only the pixels above the mean are used in computing the
central moments.  If the central moments are in a different pixel than that
used for extracting the marginal distributions the computation is repeated
using the new center.

The radius of the photometry and fitting aperture is specified by the
\fIradius\fR parameter and the \fIiteration\fR parameter.  Iteration of the
fitting radius and printing of the final radius is only done for the 'a'
key.  If the number of iterations is one then the radius is not adjusted.
If it is greater than one then the direct FWHM (described) below is used to
adjust the radius.  At each iteration the new radius is set to three times
the direct FWHM (which is six times the radius at half-maximum).  The
radius is printed as part of the output.

If the background subtraction option is selected a concentric circular
annulus is defined.  The inner edge is separated from the object
aperture by a specified buffer distance and the outer edge is defined
by a width for the annulus.  The type of background used is determined
by the parameters \fIxorder\fR and \fIyorder\fR.  If either parameter
is zero then a median of the background annulus is determined.
If 1 or greater a polynomial surface of the specified number of terms
is fit.  Typically the orders are 1 for a constant or 2 for a plane.
The median or fitted surface values within the object aperture are then
subtracted.

The flux within the circular aperture is computed by simply summing the
pixel values with centers within the specified radius of the center
position.  No partial pixel adjustments are made.  If the flux is
positive a magnitude is computed as

	magnitude = magzero - 2.5 * log10 (flux)

where the magnitude zero point is a user defined parameter.

In addition to the flux, the second intensity moments are used to compute
an ellipticity and position angle.  The equations defining the moments and
related parameters are:

.nf
	Mxx = sum (x * x * I) / sum (I)
	Myy = sum (y * y * I) / sum (I)
	Mxy = sum (x * y * I) / sum (I)
	e = sqrt ((Mxx - Myy) ** 2 + (2 * Mxy) ** 2) / (Mxx + Myy)
	pa = 0.5 * atan (2 * Mxy / (Mxx - Myy))
.fi

A nonlinear least squares profile of fixed center and zero background is
fit to the radius and flux values of the background subtracted pixels to
determine a peak intensity and FWHM.  The profile type is set by the
\fIfittype\fR parameter.  The choices are "gaussian" and "moffat".  If the
profile type is "moffat" there is an additional parameter "beta".  This
value may be specified to fix it or given as INDEF to also be determined.
The profile equations are:

.nf
	I = Ic exp (-0.5 * (r / sigma)**2)	(fittype = "gaussian")
	I = Ic (1 + (r / alpha)**2)**(-beta)	(fittype = "moffat")
.fi

where Ic is the peak value, r is the radius, and the parameters are
sigma, alpha, and beta.  The sigma and alpha values are converted to
FWHM in the reported results.

Weights which are the inverse square of the pixel radius are used.  This
has the effect of giving equal weight to all parts of the profile instead
of being overwhelmed by the larger number of pixels are larger radii.  An
additional weighting factor is used for pixels outside the half-maximum
radius (as determined using the algorithm described below).  The weights
are

.nf
	wt = exp (-(r/rhalf - 1)**2)  for r/rhalf > 1
.fi

where rhalf is the radius at half-maximum.  This has the effect
of reducing the contribution of the profile wings.

The above fit is done to the individual pixel values with a radius measured
to the center of the pixel.  For the 'a' key two additional measurements
are made on a azimuthally averaged radial profile with a finer sampling of
the radial bins.  This uses the same algorithms for centering, background
estimation, and FWHM measurement as in the task \fBpsfmeasure\fR.  The
centering is essentially the same as described above but the background
estimation is a mode of the sky annulus pixels.  Note that the centering
and background subtraction are done for these measurements regardless of
the the \fIcenter\fR and \fIbackground\fR parameters which apply only to
the photometry and profile fitting to the individual pixel values.

To form the radially smoothed profile an image interpolator function is fit
to the region containing the object.  The enclosed flux profile (total flux
within a particular radius) is computed.  The sampling is done at a much
finer resolution than individual pixels.  The subsampling scheme is that
described in \fBpsfmeasure\fR and is such that the center of the profile is
more finely sampled than the edges of the profile.

Because the image interpolator function may not be very good for narrow
profiles a second iteration is done if the radius enclosing half the flux
is less than two pixels.  In this second iteration an analytic, radially
symmetric Gaussian profile is subtracted from the image raster and the
interpolation function is fit to the residuals.  Subpixel values are then
computed by evaluating the analytic function plus the interpolated residual
value.

There are two FWHM measurements computed using the enclosed flux
radial profile.  One is to fit a Gaussian or Moffat profile to the
enclosed flux profile.  The type is selected by the same \fIfittype\fR
parameter used to select the profile to fit to the individual pixel
values.  As with the direct fit the Moffat beta value may be fixed or
included in the fit.  The FWHM of the fit is then printed on the
status line, terminal output, and log file.

The other FWHM measurement directly measure the FWHM independent of a
profile model.  The derivative of the enclosed flux profile is computed.
This derivative is the azimuthally averaged radial profile with the radial
bin sampling mentioned above.  The peak of this profile is found and the
FWHM is twice the radius of the profile at half the peak value.  This
"direct FWHM" is part of the output and is also used for the iterative
adjustment of the fitting radius as noted above.

.ls a
The output consists of the image line and column, the coordinates, the
final radius used for the photometry and fitting, magnitude, flux, mean
background, peak value of the profile fit, e, pa (in degrees between -90
and +90 with 0 along the x axis), the Moffat beta value if a Moffat profile
is fit, and three measures of the FWHM.  The coordinates are those
specified by the \fIwcs\fR and formatted by the format parameters.  For the
logical wcs the coordinates will be the same as the column and line
values.  If a value is numerically undefined then INDEF is printed.  The
FWHM values are, in order, the profile fit to the enclosed flux, the
profile fit to the individual pixels, and the direct measurement from the
derivative of the enclosed flux profile.  Note that except for the direct
method, the other estimates are not really measurements of the FWHM but are
quantities which give the correct FWHM for the specified profile type.
.le
.ls ','
The output consists of the image line and column, magnitude, flux, number
of pixels within the aperture, mean background, r (moment FWHM), e, pa (in
degrees between -90 and +90 with 0 along the x axis), and the peak value
and FWHM of the profile fit.  The label GFWHM indicates a Gaussian fit
while the label MFWHM indicates a Moffat profile fit.  If a quantity is
numerically undefined then INDEF is printed.
.le

This aperture photometry and FWHM tool is intended only for general image
analysis and quick look measurements.  The background fitting, photometry,
and FWHM techniques used are not intended for serious astronomical
photometry; other packages, e.g., \fInoao.digiphot.apphot\fR, should be
used if precise results are desired.
.le
.ls b
The integer pixel coordinates defining a region of the image are printed.
Two cursor positions are used to select the range of columns and lines.
The output format consists of the starting and ending column
coordinates and the starting and ending line coordinates.  This format is
used as input by some tasks and can be used to generate image sections if
desired.
.le
.ls j, k
The fitted gaussian center, peak, sigma, full width at half maximum, and
background at the center is computed and printed.
.le
.ls m
Statistics of a rectangular region centered on the cursor position are
computed and printed.  The size of the statistics box is set by the
parameters \fIncstat\fR and \fInlstat\fR.  The output format consists
of the image section, the number of pixels, the mean, the median, the
standard deviation, the minimum, and the maximum.
.le
.ls x, y
The cursor x and y coordinates and the pixel value nearest this position
are printed.  The 'y' key may be used define a relative origin.  If
an origin is defined (is not 0,0) then additional quantities are printed.
These quantities are origin coordinates, the delta x and delta y distances,
the radial distance, and the position angle (in degrees counterclockwise from
the x axis).
.le
.ls z
A 10x10 grid of pixel values is printed.  The integer coordinates are
also printed around the grid.
.le

.ls r, '.'
A radial profile plot is made.  As with 'a'/',' there are options for centering
and background subtraction.  There are also graphics option to set the
radius to be plotted (\fIrplot\fR) and to overplot the profile fit
(\fIfitplot\fR).  The measurement algorithms are those described for the
'a'/',' key and the output is the same except that there is no header line and
the object center is given in the graph title rather than on the graphics
status line.  The aperture sum and graph options are specified by the
parameters from the \fBrimexam\fR parameter set.
.le
.ls s
A surface plot of a region centered on the cursor is made.  The size
of the region and various surface and labeling options are
specified by the parameters from the \fBsimexam\fR parameter set.
.le
.ls u, v
A plot of a vector defined by two cursor positions is made.  The 'u'
plot uses the first cursor position to define the center of the vector
and the second position to define the endpoint.  The vector is extended
an equal distance in the opposite direction and the graph x coordinates
are the radial distance from the center position.  The 'v' plot
uses the two cursor positions as endpoints and the coordinates are
the radial distance from the first cursor position.  The vector may
be averaged over a specified number of parallel vectors.  The
averaging number and various graph options are specified by the parameters
from the \fBvimexam\fR parameter set.
.le

MISCELLANEOUS COMMANDS

The following commands control useful features of the task.

.ls d
The display command given by the parameter \fIdisplay\fR is given
with appropriate image name.  By default this loads the image
display using the \fBtv.display\fR task.  When using an input image
list this operation also appends new images to the list for subsequent
'n' and 'p' commands.
.le
.ls f
Redraw the last graph.  If the \fIautoredraw\fR parameter is no then
this is used to redraw a graph after making parameter changes with
colon commands.  If the parameter is yes then any colon command which
affects the current plot will execute a redraw automatically.
.le
.ls g, i
Cursor input may be selected to be from the graphics cursor (g) or
image display cursor (i).
.le
.ls n, p
Go to the next or previous image in the image list or display frames.
.le
.ls o
Overplot the next graph.  This generally only makes sense with the
line, column, and histogram plots.
.le
.ls q
Quit the task.
.le
.ls t
Output an image centered on the cursor position with name and size set
by the \fIoutput\fR, \fIncoutput\fR and \fInloutput\fR parameters.
Note that the cursor input might be from a contour, surface, or other
plot as well as from the image display.
.le
.ls w
Toggle output to the logfile.  If no logfile is specified this has no
effect except to print a message.  If the logfile is specified a message
is printed indicating that the logfile has been opened or closed.
Every time the logfile is opened the current image name and title is
entered as well as when the image is changed.  The logfile name may
be set or changed by a colon command.
.le
.ls :select
Select an image.  If an input image list is used the specified index
number selects an image from the list.  If an input image list is not
used and the image display is used then the specified display frame
is selected.  If the new image is different from the previous image
an identification line is inserted in the logfile if it is open.
.le
.ls :eparam, :unlearn
These colon commands manipulate the various parameter sets as
described below.
.le
.ls :c<#>, :l<#>
Special colon commands to plot specific columns or lines, symbolically
shown as <#>, rather than use a cursor position.
.le
.ls :<column> <line> <key>
Special colon command syntax to explicitly give image coordinates for
a cursor command key.
.le

COLON COMMANDS

Sometimes one wants to explicitly enter the coordinates for a command.
This may be done with a colon command having the following syntax:

	:<column> <line> <key>

where column and line are the coordinates and key is the command.
If the line is not given then <column> = <line>.  For the frequently
used line and column plots there is also the simple syntax:

.nf
	:c<column> 	or	:l<line>
.fi

with no space, e.g., ":l64".

Every parameter except the input image list and the display command
may be queried or set by a
colon command.  In addition the parameter sets for the various graphs
and aperture sum algorithm may be edited using the \fBeparam\fR editor
and reinitialized to default values using the \fBunlearn\fR command.
There are a large number of parameters as well as many graph types /
parameter sets.  To achieve some consistency and order as well as
simplify the colon commands several things have been done.

Many parameters occur in more than one graph type.  This includes things
like graph labeling, tickmarks, and so forth.  When issuing a colon
command for one of these parameters the current graph type is assumed
to be the one affected.  If the graph type is wrong or no graph has
been made then a warning is given.

If the parameter only occurs in one parameter set then the colon command
may be used with any current graph.  However, if the parameter affects the
current graph and the automatic redraw option is set then the graph will
be redrawn.

The eparam and unlearn commands also apply by default to the parameters
for the current graph.  However, they may take the keystroke character
for the graph as an argument to override this.  If the current graph
parameters are changed and the automatic redraw option is set then
the graph will be redrawn.

The important colon commands 'x' and 'y' affect the x1, y1, x2, y2
parameters in most of the graphs.  They are frequently used to override
the automatic graph scaling.  If no arguments are given the window
limits are set to INDEF resulting in plotting the full range of the
data plus a buffer.  If two values are given then only that range of
the data will be plotted.

Colon Commands

Explicit image coordinates may be entered using the colon command syntax:

	:<column> <line> <key>

where column and line are the image coordinates and the key is one
of the cursor keys.  A special syntax for line or column plots is also
available as :c# or :l# where # is a column or line and no space is
allowed.

Other colon commands set or show parameters governing the plots and other
features of the task.  Each graph type has it's own set of parameters.
When a parameter applies to more than one graph the current graph is assumed.
If the current graph is not applicable then a warning is given.  The
"eparam" and "unlearn" commands may be used to change many parameters and
without an argument the current graph parameters are modified while with
the graph key as an argument the appropriate parameter set is modified.
In the list below the graph key(s) to which a parameter applies are shown.

BUGS
If an operation is interrupted, e.g., an image display or surface plot,
\fIimexamine\fR is terminated rather than the operation in progress.

When used on a workstation \fIimexamine\fR attempts to always position the
cursor to the window (text, image, or graphics) from which input is being
taken.  Moving the mouse manually while the program is also trying to move
it can cause the mouse to be positioned to the wrong window, requiring that
it be manually moved to the window from which input is currently being taken.

When entering a colon command in image cursor mode, if one types too fast
the characters typed before the mouse is moved to the input window
will be lost.  To avoid this, pause a moment after typing the colon, before
entering the command, and verify that the mouse has been moved to the correct
window.  In the future colon command input will be entered without moving
the mouse out of the image window, which will avoid the problem.

REVISIONS
.ls IMEXAMINE V2.11.4
('t'): A new cursor key to create an output image.
.le
.ls IMEXAMINE V2.11
('a' and 'r'): The fit to the radial profile points now includes both a
Gaussian and a Moffat profile.  The Moffat profile exponent parameter,
beta, may be fixed or left free to be fit.

('a' and 'r'): New estimates of the FWHM were added to the 'a' and 'r'
keys.  These include the Moffat profile fit noted above, a direct
measurement of the FWHM from the radially binned profile, and a Gaussian or
Moffat fit to the radial enclosed flux profile.  The output from these keys
was modified to include the new information.

('a' and 'r'): The direct FWHM may be used to iteratively adjust the
fitting radius to lessen the dependence on the initial fitting
radius value.

(',' and '.'): New keys to do the Gaussian or Moffat fitting without
iteration or the enclosed flux and direct measurements.  The output
format is the same as the previous version.

('k'): Added a kimexam parameter set.
