NAME
mode -- modal filter a list of images
.ih
USAGE
mode input output xwindow ywindow
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images.
.le
.ls output
List of filtered images. The number of input images must be the same as
the number of output images. If the input image name is the same as the
output image name the original image is replaced by the filtered image.
.le
.ls xwindow, ywindow
The size of the modal filter. Xwindow and ywindow are assumed to be
odd integers. Even values will be rounded up to the nearest odd integer.
.le
.ls zloreject = INDEF, zhireject = INDEF
The minimum and maximum good data values. Zloreject and zhireject default
to -MAX_REAL and MAX_REAL respectively.
.le
.ls boundary = "nearest"
The type of boundary extension. The options are:
.ls nearest
Use the value of the nearest boundary pixel.
.le
.ls constant
Use a constant value.
.le
.ls reflect
Reflect pixel values around the boundary.
.le
.ls wrap
Wrap pixel values around the boundary.
.le
.le
.ls constant = 0.
The value for constant value boundary extension.

DESCRIPTION

MODE takes a list of input images \fIinput\fR and produces a set of filtered
output images \fIoutput\fR. The modal filter consists of a sliding
rectangular window  of dimensions \fIxwindow\fR
by \fIywindow\fR. The center pixel of the window is replaced by the mode
of all the pixels in the window where the mode of a sequence of numbers
is defined below.

.nf
		mode = 3. * median - 2. * mean
.fi

The median of a sequence of pixels is defined as the value of the
(n + 1) / 2 number in the ordered sequence.
Out of bounds pixel references are handled by setting the parameter
\fIboundary\fR.

The \fIzloreject\fR and \fIzhireject\fR parameters may be used to reject
bad data from the modal filtering box.  If no good 
data is left in the filtering box, then the mode is set to zloreject
if the majority of the pixels are less than zloreject, or to zhireject
if the majority of pixels are greater than zhireject.

EXAMPLES

1. Modal filter an image using a 5 by 5 window and nearest pixel boundary
extension.

.nf
   im> mode m74 m74.5by5 5 5
.fi

2. Modal filter an image using a 3 by 3 window and constant boundary
extension.

.nf
   im> mode m74 m74.5by5 3 3 boun=const const=0.
.fi

3. Modal filter the test image, rejecting pixels < 5 and > 19935 from the
modal filter.

.nf
    im> mode dev$pix pix77 7 7 zlo=5 zhi=19935
.fi

TIME REQUIREMENTS

Mode requires approximately 11 and 19 CPU seconds to filter a 512 by
512 integer image using a 5 by 5 and 7 by 7 filter window respectively
(SPARCStation2).

BUGS

The sort routine for the smaller kernels has been optimized. It may be
desirable to optimize higher order kernels in future.

The IRAF task FMODE is significantly more efficient than MODE
and should be used if the data can be quantized.
