NAME
gradient -- convolve a list of images with the gradient filter
.ih
USAGE
gradient input output gradient
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of images for which gradient images are to be calculated.
.le
.ls output
List of output images. The number of output images must equal the number of
input images. If the input image name equals the output image name the
convolved image will replace the input image.
.le
.ls gradient
The gradient filters are a set of 8 three by three kernels identified by the
angle of maximum response as measured counter-clockwise to the x axis. The
kernels approximate the gradient operator, which is defined as the slope of
the intensity distribution in an image.  The eight supported gradient
operators are listed below.
.ls "0", "180"
Calculate the gradient image along a 0 or 180 degree angle.
These options approximate the d/dx operator.
Option "0" produces a maximum response for pixel values which
increase with increasing x, whereas option "180" produces a maximum
response for pixel values which decrease with increasing x. 
.le
.ls "90", "270"
Calculate the gradient image along a 90 or 270 degree angle.
These options approximate the d/dy operator.
Option "90" produces a maximum response for pixel values which
increase with increasing y, whereas option "270" produces a maximum
response for pixel values which decrease with increasing y.
.le
.ls "45", "225"
Calculate the gradient image along a 45 or 225 degree angle.
Option "45" produces a maximum response for pixel values which increase
along a line at 45 degrees counter-clockwise to the x axis.
Option "225" produces
a maximum response for pixel values which increase along a line at 225
degrees to the x axis.
.le
.ls "135", "315" 
Calculate the gradient image along a 135 or 315 degree angle.
Option "135" produces a maximum response for pixel values which increase
along a line at 135 degrees counter-clockwise to the x axis.
Option "315" produces
a maximum response for pixel values which increase along a line at 315
degrees to the x axis.
.le
.le
.ls boundary = "nearest"
The algorithm used to compute the values of out of bounds pixels. The 
options are:
.ls nearest
Use the value of the nearest boundary pixel.
.le
.ls constant
Use a constant value.
.le
.ls reflect
Generate a value by reflecting around the boundary.
.le
.ls wrap
Generate a value by wrapping around to the opposite side of the image.
.le
.le
.ls constant = 0.
The constant for constant-valued boundary extension.

DESCRIPTION

GRADIENT convolves the list of images specified by \fIinput\fR with one of
eight three by three gradient kernels specified by \fIgradient\fR 
and places the output images in \fIoutput\fR.
If the image names in \fIoutput\fR equal the image names in \fIinput\fR the
gradient operation is performed in place and the original images are
overwritten. Out of bounds pixels are computed using the algorithm
specified by \fIboundary\fR.

GRADIENT acts like a simple edge detector or high pass filter which is sensitive
to both the magnitude and direction of changes in intensity in an image.
For example, if an image's pixel values are specified by the sum of their
x and y coordinates (z = x + y) and boundary extension effects are ignored,
the "0", "45", "90", "135", "180", "225", "270", and "315" gradient kernels
will each produce a constant image containing the numbers 1, sqrt (2), 1, 0,
-1, -sqrt (2), -1, and 0 respectively. 

The eight gradient filters are listed below. The I[*,*] are the elements of
the input image and the O[*,*] are elements of the output image.
