NAME
laplace -- convolve a list of images with a Laplacian filter
.ih
USAGE
laplace input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of images to be convolved.
.le
.ls output
List of output images. The number of output images must equal the number of
input images. If the input image name equals the output image name the
convolved image will replace the input image.
.le
.ls laplace = "xycentral"
The Laplacian filters are a set of four three by three kernels which
approximate the Laplacian operator, where a Laplacian operator is defined
as the sum of the partial second derivatives in x and y.
The elements of the four Laplacian kernels are shown in detail below.
.ls xycentral
The elements of the central column and row of a 3 by 3 image subraster are
combined to estimate the Laplacian at the position of the central pixel.
.le
.ls diagonals
The elements of the two diagonals of a 3 by 3 image subraster are combined
to estimate the Laplacian at the position of the central pixel.
.le
.ls xyall
The three columns and rows of a three by three image subraster are averaged
to estimate the Laplacian at the position of the central pixel.
.le
.ls xydiagonals
The central row and column and the two diagonals of a three by three image
subraster are combined to estimate the Laplacian at the position of the
central pixel.
.le
.le
.ls boundary = "nearest"
The algorithm used to compute the values of the out of bounds pixels.
The options are:
.ls nearest
Use the value of the nearest boundary pixel.
.le
.ls constant
Use a constant value.
.le
.ls reflect
Generate a value by reflecting around the boundary.
.le
.ls wrap
Generate a value by wrapping around to the opposite side of the image.
.le
.le
.ls constant = 0.
The constant for constant-valued boundary extension.

DESCRIPTION

LAPLACE convolves the list of images specified by \fIinput\fR with one of
four 3 by 3 Laplacian kernels specified by \fIlaplace\fR
and places the convolved images in \fIoutput\fR. If the image names
in \fIoutput\fR equal the image names in \fIinput\fR the Laplacian
operation is performed in place and the original images are overwritten.
Out of bounds pixels are computed using the algorithm specified by
\fIboundary\fR.

The Laplacian filters are high-pass filters which act as a local edge detector.
A characteristic of the Laplacian is that it is zero at points where the
gradient is a maximum or a minimum. Therefore points detected as gradient
edges would generally not be detected as edge points with the Laplacian
filter. Another characteristic of Laplacian operators is that a single
grey level transition may produce two distinct peaks one positive and
one negative in the Laplacian which may be offset from the gradient location.

The four Laplacian filters are listed below. The I[*,*] are the elements of the
input image and the O[*,*] are the elements of the output image.
