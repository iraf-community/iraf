	Interactive Colon Commands

The parameters are listed or set with the following commands which may be
abbreviated.  To list the value of a parameter type the command alone.

:function [value]    Fitting function (chebyshev,legendre,polynomial)
:order	  [value]    X and Y fitting orders in x and y
:xxorder  [value]    X fitting function order in x
:xyorder  [value]    X fitting function order in y
:yxorder  [value]    Y fitting function order in x
:yyorder  [value]    Y fitting function order in y
:xxterms  [n/h/f]    X fit cross terms type
:yxterms  [n/h/f]    Y fit cross terms type
:maxiter  [value]    Maximum number of rejection iterations
:reject   [value]    K-sigma rejection threshold
