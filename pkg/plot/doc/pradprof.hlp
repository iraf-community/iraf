NAME
pradprof -- plot or list the radial profile of a stellar object
.ih
USAGE
pradprof input xinit yinit
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of images containing the object of interest.
.le
.ls xinit, yinit
The initial guess for the  x and y coordinates of the object whose
profile is to be computed.  If \fIcenter\fR
is yes, \fIxinit\fR and \fIyinit\fR are the initial input to the centering 
algorithm, otherwise \fIxinit\fR and \fIyinit\fR are passed directly to the
radial profiling algorithm.
.le
.ls radius = 11
The plotting radius in pixels.
.le
.ls az1 = 0., az2 = 360.
Azimuth limits for the profile points in degrees.  The azimuth is
measured from the x or first image axis towards the y or second image
axis.  Negative azimuths are allowed as are any multiples of 360.
.le
.ls center = yes 
Center the initial coordinates before computing the profile?
.le
.ls cboxsize = 5
The size of the extraction box of pixels to be used by the centering
algorithm.
.le
.ls list = no
Make a list of the radial profile, instead of a plot?
.le 
.ls graphics = "stdgraph"
The graphics device for plotting.
.le
.ls append = no
Append to an existing plot?
.le
.ls title = "imtitle"
The plot title. If title = "imtitle", the image name, \fIxinit\fR, and
\fIyinit\fR are
used to construct a default title, otherwise the user specified title is
used.
.le
.ls xlabel = "Radius", ylabel = "Intensity"
The default labels for the X and Y axes.
.le
.ls wx1 = INDEF, wx2 = INDEF, wy1 = INDEF, wy2 = INDEF
The range of user coordinates spanned by the plot. By default the data is
used to determine the range.
.le
.ls logx = no, logy = yes
Use log scaling on the x or y axes of the plot?
.le
.ls round = no
Round the axes minimum and maximum values up to "nice" values?
.le
.ls box = yes
Draw axes at the perimeter of the plotting window?
.le
.ls majrx = 5, minrx = 5, majry = 5, minry = 5
Number of major tick marks on each axis and number of minor tick marks between
major tick marks. These quantities are ignored if log scaling is in effect
for an axis.
.le
.ls ticklabels = yes
Label the tick marks?
.le
.ls fill = yes
Fill the output viewport regardless of the device aspect ratio ?
.le
.ls vx1 = 0.0, vx2 = 1.0, vy1 = 0.0, vy2 = 1.0
The NDC coordinates (0.0:1.0) of the device plotting viewport.
.le
.ls pointmode = yes
Plot points instead of lines?
.le
.ls marker = "plus"
Type of marker used in pointmode.
.le
.ls szmarker = 1.
Size of markers used in pointmode.
.le

DESCRIPTION

PRADPROF computes a radial profile of length \fIradius\fR pixels
with a range of azimuths (\fIaz1\fR to \fIaz2\fR),
for the object near (\fIxinit\fR, \fIyinit\fR) in the input image(s) 
\fIinput\fR, and plots it on the graphics device \fIgraphics\fR.
If the parameter \fIcenter\fR is
"yes", then pixels in a box \fIcboxwidth\fR wide around the initial
coordinates and a simple centroiding algorithm  are used to
compute a more accurate center, before the radial profile is computed.

The azimuths are measured from the first image axis towards the second
image axis.  The limits may be given in any multiple of 360 degrees
including negative azimuths.

If the parameter
\fIappend\fR is yes then the new plot will be appended to an existing plot,
otherwise the device is cleared and a new plot is made. The
remainder of the parameters control the details of how
the plot is displayed. If the parameter \fBlist\fR is "yes" 
the radial profile is listed on the standard output instead of plotted.

EXAMPLES
1. Plot the radial profile of a star near (123, 234).

    cl> pradprof m92red 123 234 

2. Plot the profile around (123, 234) with centering turned off.

    cl> pradprof m92red 123 234 center=no

3. List the radial profile and redirect it to a file.

    cl> pradprof m92red 123 234 list=yes > profile
