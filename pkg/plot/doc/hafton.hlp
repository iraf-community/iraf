NAME
hafton -- draw a half tone picture of an image
.ih
USAGE
hafton image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
Two dimensional image or image section to be plotted.
.le
.ls z1 = 0.0, z2 = 0.0
The minimum (z1) and maximum (z2) intensities to be mapped.  If left at the
default values of 0.0, the full intensity range will be mapped.
.le
.ls nlevels = 0
The number of intensities levels to be shown.  If \fBnlevels = 0\fR or \fB1\fR,
the maximum of 16 levels is used.
.le
.ls mapping_function = "linear"
A string specifying the image intensity to half tone mapping function.
The default is linear mapping between \fBz1\fR and \fBz2\fR.  For other
choices, see the description section below.
.le
.ls contrast = 0.25
Positive or negative contrast.  Negative contrast is indicated by setting
\fBcontrast\fR to a negative number.  The magnitude of \fBcontrast\fR is
not important unless \fBmapping_function = crtpict\fR.
.le
.ls perimeter = yes
Should a \fBcrtpict\fR perimeter with labeled tickmarks be drawn around 
the plot?
.le
.ls device="stdgraph"
Output device for plot.
.le
.ls title = "imtitle"
The title to be centered above the plot.  By default, the title string from
the image header is used.
.le
.ls xres = 64, yres = 64
The input image is block averaged or subsampled to this resolution.
.le
.ls preserve = yes
If \fBpreserve\fR = yes, the aspect ratio of the image is preserved when
achieving the resolution specified by \fBxres\fR and \fByres\fR.
.le
.ls subsample = no
Should the image be subsampled (as opposed to block averaged) to achieve the
specified resolution?
.le
.ls vx1 = 0.0, vx2 = 0.0, vy1 = 0.0, vy2 = 0.0
The device viewport, in normalized device coordinates (from 0.0 to 1.0
inclusive).  If not specified by the user, the plot is centered on the viewport.
.le
.ls fill = no
Should the plot fill the viewport regardless of the device aspect ratio?
.le
.ls append = no
Append to an existing plot?
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Task \fIhafton\fR draws a half tone picture of an IRAF image, where varying
intensities in the image are represented by areas of varying darkness on
the plot.  Six different mapping functions are available; the desired 
mapping function is selected with the \fBmapping_function\fR string.
The types of mapping are:

.nf
   linear
   exponential - emphasizes high intensity values.
   logarithmic - emphasizes low intensity values.
   sinusoidal  - emphasizes mid-range values.
   arcsine     - extreme values emphasized at the expense of mid-range.
   crtpict     - linear mapping centered on median intensity.  The slope of
		 the function is modified by \fBcontrast\fR.
.fi

To speed up the plotting, the resolution of the input image can be 
decreased to \fBxres\fR by \fByres\fR.  
When \fBpreserve\fR = yes, \fBhafton\fR automatically reduces the 
image in both directions by the same factor, which
is the larger of [ncolumns / xres or nlines / yres].  If the
aspect ratio is not being preserved, the x and y dimensions are independently
reduced to the specified resolution.
No reduction is done if
\fBxres\fR and \fByres\fR = 0, if the input image is an image section, or
if the image is smaller than \fBxres\fR by \fByres\fR.

If the device viewport is not set by the user, \fIhafton\fR automatically
sets a viewport centered on the output device.  The default value of
\fBfill=no\fR means the viewport will be adjusted so that equal
numbers of image pixels in x and y will occupy equal lengths when plotted.
That is, when \fBfill=no\fR, a unity aspect
ratio is enforced, and square images are represented as square plots
regardless of the device aspect ratio.
On devices with non square full device
viewports (e.g., the vt640), a square image will appear extended when
\fBfill=yes\fR.

EXAMPLES
1. Image "crab.6563" is plotted in negative contrast, with linear mapping
between the minimum and maximum image pixel.

.nf
    cl> hafton crab.6563 contrast=-1
.fi

2. The image is plotted in negative contrast using the same mapping
function as used by the \fIcrtpict\fR task.  The resulting plot is
in negative contrast.

.nf
    cl> hafton crab.6563 mapping_fun=crt contrast =-0.25
.fi

TIME REQUIREMENTS
To produce a \fIhafton\fR plot on the terminal takes just under 9 cpu
minutes.  If the output device is the imagen or versatec (or another
nspp device) the total cpu time is about an hour.  
.ih
BUGS
A large number of plotter instructions ( > 100,000 polylines) is generated 
per frame for square images.
