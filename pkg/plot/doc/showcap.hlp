NAME
showcap -- show and decode graphcap entries
.ih
USAGE
showcap

PARAMETERS
None

DESCRIPTION
\fBShowcap\fR is an interactive, parameterless task that prints and interprets
entries in the IRAF graphics device capability file dev$graphcap.  These
entries contain device dimensions, character sizes etc. plus information for 
encoding and decoding the ASCII control sequences sent to or returned by the
device.  \fBShowcap\fR is thus mainly used by IRAF programmers for debugging
new graphcap device entries.

At startup \fBshowcap\fR prints the following instructions to STDOUT, then
prompts with an asterisk.

.nf
	cmd :  `set' device
	    |  `*' (to dump full graphcap entry)
	    |  cc [arg1 [arg2 [arg3]]]
	    ;
	
	cc  :   a two character capcode (e.g., 'cm')
	    |   an encoder program (non alpha first char)
	    ;
	*
.fi

The user must first use `set' to tell \fBshowcap\fR which graphics device to
read from graphcap.  After a `set' or `*', the full graphcap entry for the
named device will be printed.  To view an individual capability, type the
two-character capability name.

Some device capability entries take up to three arguments, which may be 
listed on the same line after `cc', separated by whitespace.  \fBShowcap\fR
is particularly useful for decoding the binary encoder entries used by the
graphics kernels.  See the examples below.

EXAMPLES
1. Examine the graphcap entry for the Retrographics vt640.

.nf
	cl> showcap
	  * set vt640		(dumps vt640 entry)
.fi

2. Decode the sequence sent to the terminal for setting text height 2.

.nf
	  * TH 2
		    program:  ^[(1#47+.
		    encoding: ^[1
.fi

3. Decode the sequence sent to the terminal to set line type 3.

.nf
	  * LT 3
		    program:  LT=\E/(1$0)1d\E`($1-5)0d\E(1_+.$D)0d\E`($$:\
		    encoding: ^[/0d^[b
.fi

4. Set environment variable "graphcap" to your local test graphcap file, 
set device to vt240 and examine the write-cursor (WC) command for
x-coordinate 150, y-coordinate 350, and cursor 1.

.nf
	cl> set graphcap = "mytest.graphcap"
	cl> showcap
	  * set vt240		(dumps vt240 entry)
	  * WC 150 350 1
		    program:  P[(1)%d,(2)%d]
		    encoding: P[150,350]
.fi

5. Examine the scan-cursor function returned when the user types key `a'
from coordinate x=150, y=350 after a read-cursor request.

.nf
	  * SC a[150,350]
		    program:  (#0!1#0!2,!3,#0!8,#48-!99$0-91#10*9+!1#1!8
			      $$8#1=#-39;#0!8,#48-!99$0-92#10*9+!2#1!8
			      $$8#1=#-39;);
		    X(R1)=150 Y(R2)=350, key = a
.fi

BUGS
Diagnostics are mostly limited to a numeric status return when debugging
binary encoder entries that contain bugs.
