PARAMETERS
.ls input
The input metacode, which can be read from a list of files or
redirected from the standard input.
.le
.ls generic = no
The remaining parameters are ignored when \fBgeneric\fR = yes.
.le
.ls verbose = no
If \fBverbose\fR = yes, the elements of polylines, cell arrays, etc. will
be printed.
.le
.ls gkiunits = no
By default, coordinates are printed in NDC rather than GKI units.

DESCRIPTION
Task \fBgkidecode\fR is a debugging tool used to decode GKI metacode
files.  The plotting instructions are decoded and printed in readable 
form on the standard output.  The input metacode can be read from one
or more files or redirected from the standard input.

If \fBverbose\fR = yes, elements of polyline and cell array calls are
printed in addition to the default output.
Coordinates can be printed in either GKI (0 - 32767) or NDC (0.0 - 1.0)
units.

EXAMPLES
1. Decode the metacode instructions in file crtpict.mc in verbose mode.

    cl> gkidecode crtpict.mc verbose+

2. Print a shorter listing of the same file on the versatec.

    cl> gkidecode crtpict.mc | lprint dev=ver

3. Decode the third frame in metacode file "oned.mc".

    cl> gkiextract oned.mc 3 | gkidecode
