NAME
stdgraph -- draws a plot on the terminal
.ih
USAGE
stdgraph input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The input metacode, may be a list of files or redirected STDIN.
.le
.ls device = "stdgraph"
The terminal type.
.le
.ls generic = no
The remaining parameters are ignored if \fBgeneric\fR = yes.
.le
.ls debug = no
When \fBdebug\fR = yes, the decoded plotting instructions are printed
during processing.
.le
.ls verbose = no
If \fBverbose\fR = yes, elements of polylines and cell array calls are 
printed in debug mode.
.le
.ls gkiunits = no
In debug mode, coordinates can be printed in GKI rather than NDC units.
.le
.ls txquality = "normal"
The character drawing quality.
.le
.ls xres = 0, yres= 0
The number of resolution elements in x and y
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Task \fIstdgraph\fR translates GKI metacode and draws a plot on a
graphics terminal.  Input to
\fIstdgraph\fR is GKI metacode, which can be read from one or more 
metacode files or redirected from the standard input.  

Parameters 
\fBtxquality\fR, \fBxres\fR, and \fByres\fR are used to override the
values for text quality, and x and y resolution already in the metacode.
Values for \fBtxquality\fR are chosen from normal, low, medium or high.
High quality characters are software generated, and can be of any size.

If \fBdebug\fR is set to yes, the plotting instructions are printed in
readable form as the metacode is processed.  In debug mode, GKI 
instructions can be printed in verbose mode, where the elements of
polylines and cell arrays are printed in addition to the default output.
Coordinates can be printed in either GKI (0 - 32767) or NDC (0.0 - 1.0)
units.

EXAMPLES
1. Extract the fourth frame from metacode file "plots.mc" and plot it.

    cl> gkiextract plots.mc 4 | stdgraph

2. Process file "one.mc" in debug mode.

    cl> stdgraph oned.mc debug+

3. Plot file "oned.mc" with high quality text generation.

    cl> stdgraph oned.mc txquality=high
