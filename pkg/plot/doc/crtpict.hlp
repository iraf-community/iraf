NAME
crtpict -- make a hardcopy of an IRAF image
.ih
USAGE
crtpict input 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Input images to be processed.
.le
.ls device = "dicomed"
The output device.
.le
.ls auto_fill = yes
If set to yes, the image will be scaled to fit the device viewport.
The aspect ratio is always preserved when \fIauto_fill\fR = yes.
.le
.ls xmag = 1.0, ymag = 1.0
When \fIauto_fill\fR = no, the x and y magnification ratios are specified
by these parameters.
.le
.ls replicate = yes
The image pixels are block replicated to fit the device viewport when
\fIreplicate\fR = yes.  Otherwise, the pixels are linearly interpolated
to match the device pixels.
.le
.ls x_block_avg = 1, y_block_avg = 1
These parameters are used when \fIreplicate\fR = no to decrease the
effective output device resolution, and speed up the interpolation.  The
pixels are interpolated to the block averaged output device, then
block replicated to fill the device viewport.
.le
.ls ztrans = "auto"
This parameter specifies how the image intensities are mapped into the 
greyscale values of the output device.  Intensity z1 maps to black, z2 to white.
The 4 choices for \fIztrans\fR are:

.nf
	"auto"		- z1 and z2 centered on median of image
	"min_max"	- set z1 and z2 to specified intensities
	"none" 		- truncate intensities to fit output range
	"user"		- user supplies look up table of values
.fi
.le
.ls lutfile = ""
Name of text file containing the look up table when \fIztrans\fR = user. 
The table should contain two columns per line; column 1 contains the 
intensity, column 2 the desired greyscale output.  
.le
.ls contrast = 0.25
Used when automatically determining z1 and z2.  The slope of the transfer
function is divided by \fIcontrast\fR, so negative values of \fIcontrast\fR
result in a negative transfer function.
.le
.ls nsample_lines = 25
Used when automatically determining z1 and z2, this parameter sets the number 
of image lines to be sampled when determining the median.
.le
.ls z1 = 0.0, z2 = 0.0
These parameters are used when \fIztrans\fR = "min_max", to specify which
pixel values map to black and white.  
.le
.ls perimeter = yes
Draw annotated axes around the plot perimeter?
.le
.ls image_fraction = 0.70
The fraction of the vertical device viewport reserved for the image.
.le
.ls graphics_fraction = 0.20
The fraction of the vertical device viewport reserved for histogram
plots and id information. 
.le
.ls greyscale_fraction = 0.05
The fraction of the vertical device viewport reserved for the greyscale
step wedge.  
.le
.ls output = ""
Output metacode is appended to this file.
By naming an output file, the metacode can be "trapped", and the normal
spooling process intercepted.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Procedure \fBcrtpict\fR makes a photographic hardcopy plot of IRAF images.

The image can be automatically scaled to fill the output plotting window, with 
the aspect ratio preserved, by setting \fBauto_fill\fR = yes.  When 
\fBauto_fill\fR = no, magnification factors for the axes are entered as 
\fBxmag\fR and \fBymag\fR, where negative values (as well as fractional 
values < 1.0), indicate that the image is to be reduced.  By default, the
imaged is enlarged by block replication.  By setting \fBreplicate\fR = no,
the image will be linearly interpolated to fit the device area.  (In this
case, to speed things up, the \fBblock_avg\fR parameters can be set to
reduce the effective output resolution.)  In either case, if an image needs
to be reduced in size, it will be decimated.   

Four methods of determining the greyscale transformation are available.
When \fIztrans\fR = "none", no transformation between intensity and 
greyscale level occurs, the intensities are simply copied, which will most
likely result in truncation.  With this method, the lowest bits of each pixel, 
the lowest level variations, are always shown, regardless of the dynamic 
range of the image.

When \fIztrans\fR = "auto",
the greyscale levels are automatically centered on the median of the image 
pixels.  The window of intensities spanned by the greyscale is controlled 
by parameter \fIcontrast\fR, which is divided into the calculated slope of 
the transfer function. The larger the absolute value of \fIcontrast\fR, the 
higher the contrast in the output image.  A subset of the image pixels are 
used to determine the median; the number of lines sampled is 
\fInsample_lines\fR.

When \fBztrans\fR = "min_max", intensity \fBz1\fR maps to the minimum
greyscale level (black), \fBz2\fR maps to the maximum greyscale level
(white) and the transfer function is linear in between these two endpoints.
If \fIz1\fR = \fIz2\fR, the image min and max map to black and white, modified
by \fBcontrast\fR.  (NOTE:  When running \fIcrtpict\fR on an image created with 
\fIsnap\fR, \fBztrans\fR should be set to "min_max", with \fBz1\fR = 0 and
\fBz2\fR = 1023, the maximum output value possible from the IIS.)

When \fBztrans\fR = "user", a look up table of intensity values and their
corresponding greyscale levels is read from the file specified by the
\fBlutfile\fR parameter.  From this information, 
\fIcrtpict\fR constructs a piecewise linear look up table containing
4096 discrete values.  
The text format table contains two columns per line; 
column 1 contains the intensity, column 2 the desired greyscale output.  
The greyscale values specified by the user must match those available on
the output device.  Task \fBshowcap\fR can be used to determine the range
of acceptable greyscale levels.

EXAMPLES
1.  To subsample every 4th pixel of a large image, fill the output area and use
previously determined values of z1 and z2 for the greyscale transformation
the command would be:

.nf
    cl> crtpict sunpic[*:4,*:4] ztrans=min z1=0 z2=800
.fi

2.  To process every image with the root name ccdpic, using default values of
all parameters, the command would be:

.nf
    cl> crtpict ccdpic*
.fi

3.  To process images created with \fBsnap\fR, ztrans and z2 must be changed
from their default values:

.nf
    cl> crtpict iis.snap ztrans=min z2=1023
.fi

4.  Image `mypic' is processed using the look up table in file `mylut',

.nf
    cl> crtpict mypic ztrans=user lutfile=mylut
.fi

Where file `mylut' contains this information:

.nf
		10	40
		1500	100
		2500	100
		3500	200
		7500	255
.fi

TIMING
For a 512 x 512 real image, \fBcrtpict\fR takes about 40 cpu seconds with
\fBauto_fill\fR and \fBreplicate\fR = yes.  When \fBauto_fill\fR = yes
but \fBreplicate\fR = no, \fBcrtpict\fR requires almost 400 cpu seconds.
