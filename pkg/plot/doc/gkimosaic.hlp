NAME
gkimosaic -- condense metacode frames to fit on one page
.ih
USAGE
gkimosaic input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The metacode input, which can be redirected from STDIN or read from
one or more binary metacode files.
.le
.ls output = ""
If \fBoutput\fR is specified, the mosaiced metacode is spooled to this
file for later plotting.
.le
.ls device = "stdgraph"
Output plotting device.
.le
.ls nx = 2
The number of plots to draw in the x direction.
.le
.ls ny = 2
The number of plots to draw in the y direction.
.le
.ls fill = no
The plots are reduced by equal factors in x and y when \fBfill\fR = no. 
.le
.ls rotate = no
Output the mosaiced plots rotated by 90 degrees.
.le
.ls interactive = yes
If plotting to \fBstdgraph\fR, interactively examine each page of plots.
.le
.ls cursor = "stdgcur"
Source of cursor input.
.le

DESCRIPTION
Task \fBgkimosaic\fR condenses the plots in a metacode file to fit
on a single page.  The plots can be examined interactively after
each pageful.  The number of plots in x and y can be specified.  This
task is useful for browsing through a large metacode file, and for
compactly plotting a large number of metacode frames.

When \fBfill\fR = no, the plots will be
reduced by equal factors in x and y; the aspect ratio of the original 
plot is preserved.  When \fBfill\fR = yes, the transformations in x and
y are handled separately, meaning that the reduction factors will not
be equal unless \fBnx\fR = \fBny\fR.  

The mosaiced plots are drawn on the page rotated by 90 degrees
when \fBrotate\fR = yes.  This means the x axis of the plots can be
placed along either the page width or length.
The plots can be output to a plotting \fBdevice\fR,
or spooled in file \fBoutput\fR for later plotting.

If plotting to \fBstdgraph\fR, the plot can be interactively
examined after each page of output by setting \fBinteractive\fR = yes.
The world coordinate system information of the individual plots has 
been retained for cursor readback.
Standard cursor mode keystroke commands are available as well as the
\fIgkimosaic\fR specific commands listed below.  Colon commands :nx, :ny, 
:fill and :rotate take effect on the next page of output.  Command :skip
allows you to browse through a metacode file, skipping either forward or
backward by N input plots.

	:skip +/-N			skip forward/backward N plots

EXAMPLES
1. Plot every frame in the metacode file "oned.plots".  There will be 4 plots
to the page originally, but this can be overridden interactively.

    cl> gkimosaic oned.plots

2. Extract every third plot from the metacode file "oned.plots" with task
\fIgkiextract\fR and plot them four to a page.

    cl> gkiextract oned.plots 1-99x3 | gkimosaic

3. Plot all frames in every metacode file beginning with "mcode." and
condense them so 16 fit on a page.  The metacode is being spooled;
it will be plotted, perhaps, when the computer isn't so busy.  Interactive
mode is automatically disabled when not plotting to a graphics terminal.

    cl> gkimosaic mcode.* nx=4 ny=4 output=plt.spool

BUGS
Setting \fBdevice\fR to "stdvdm" does not work.  To produce an output file
of mosaiced metacode, use the \fIoutput\fR parameter or the ">G" graphics 
stream redirection feature of the cl.
