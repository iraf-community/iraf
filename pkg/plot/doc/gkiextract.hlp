DESCRIPTION
Task \fBgkiextract\fR will extract individual frames from a metacode file, 
writing a binary metacode output stream which can be piped to a kernel
for plotting or redirected to produce a new metacode file.  
Parameter \fIframes\fR specifies a list of frames to be
extracted from each input file.  If \fIverify\fR  = yes,
a \fBgkidir\fR style line will be printed for each specified frame 
and the user will be queried whether or not to extract the frame.

EXAMPLES
1. Extract frames 1, 3 and 5 from metacode file "mc_file" and
plot them on the device "vup":

    cl> gkiextract mc_file 1,3,5 | stdplot dev=vup

2. Print a directory of the first 99 frames in "mc_file", extract
those files requested by the user and write them to file "new_mc_file".

    cl> gkiextract mc_file 1-99 ver+ > new_mc_file
