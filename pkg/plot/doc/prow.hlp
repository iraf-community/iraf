NAME
prow -- plot an image row
.ih
USAGE
prow image row
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
Input image containing the row to be plotted.
.le
.ls row       
The row to be plotted.
.le
.ls wcs = "logical"
The world coordinate system (\fIwcs\fR) to be used for axis labeling when
input is f rom images.
The following standard world systems are predefined.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are image pixel coordinates relative to the image currently
being displayed.
.le
.ls physical
The physical coordinate system is invariant with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image matrix.  For example, if the reference
image was created by extracting a section of another image, the physical
coordinates of an object in the reference image will be the pixel coordinates
of the same object in the original image.  The physical coordinate system
thus provides a consistent coordinate system (a given object always has the
same coordinates) for all images, regardless of whether any user world
coordinate systems have been defined.
.le
.ls world
The "world" coordinate system is the \fIcurrent default WCS\fR.
The default world system is the system named by the environment variable
\fIdefwcs\fR if defined in the user environment and present in the reference
image WCS description, else it is the first user WCS defined for the image
(if any), else physical coordinates are returned.
.le
.ls wx1=0., wx2=0., wy1=0., wy2=0.
The range of window (user) coordinates to be included in the plot.  If
the range of values in x or y = 0, the plot is automatically scaled
from the minimum to maximum data values along the degenerate direction.
.le
.le
.ls vx1=0., vx2=0., vy1=0., vy2=0.
NDC coordinates (0-1) of the device plotting viewport.  If not set by
the user, a suitable viewport which allows sufficient room for all
labels is used.
.le
.ls pointmode = no
Plot individual points instead of a continuous line?
.le
.ls marker = "box"
Marker or line type to be drawn.  If \fBpointmode\fR = yes the markers are
"point", "box", "cross", "plus", "circle", "hebar", "vebar", "hline",
"vline" or "diamond".  Any other value defaults to "box".  If drawing lines,
\fBpointmode\fR = no, the values are "line", "lhist", "bhist".  Any other
value defaults to "line".  "bhist" (box histogram) draws lines to the
bottom of the graph while "lhist" does not.  In both cases the
horizontal histogram lines run between the half way points (reflected
at the ends).
.le
.ls szmarker = 0.005
The size of the marker drawn when \fBpointmode\fR = yes.
.le
.ls logx = no, logy = no
Draw the x or y axis in log units, versus linear?
.le
.ls xlabel = "wcslabel", ylabel = ""
Label for the X-axis or Y-axis.  if \fBxlabel\fR = "wcslabel"
the world coordinate system label in the image, if defined, is used.
.le
.ls xformat = "wcsformat"
The numerical format for the coordinate labels.  The values may be ""
(an empty string), %f for decimal format, %h and %H for xx:xx:xx format, and
%m and %M for xx:xx.x format.  The upper case %H and %M convert degrees
to hours.  Some images have a recommended x coordinate format defined as
a WCS attribute.  If the xformat value is "wcsformat" the WCS attribute
format will be used.  Any other value will override the image attribute.
.le
.ls title = "imtitle"
Title for plot.  If not changed from the default, the title string from the
image header, appended with the row being plotted, is used.
.le
.ls majrx=5, minrx=5, majry=5, minry=5
The number of major and minor divisions along the x or y axis.
.le
.ls round = no
Round axes up to nice values?
.le
.ls fill = yes
Fill plotting viewport regardless of device aspect ratio?
.le
.ls append = no
Append to an existing plot?
.le
.ls device="stdgraph"
Output device.
.le

DESCRIPTION
Plot a specified row from an image.  The user can control the
plot size and placement, the scaling and labeling of axes.  Rows can be
plotted as a continuous line or individual points with a specified marker.

If \fBappend\fR is enabled, previous values for \fBbox\fR,
\fBfill\fR, \fBround\fR, the plotting viewport (\fBvx1\fR, \fBvx2\fR, 
\fBvy1\fR, \fBvy2\fR), and the plotting window (\fBwx1\fR, \fBwx2\fR, 
\fBwy1\fR, \fBwy2\fR) are used.

If the plotting viewport was not set by the user, \fBprow\fR 
automatically sets a viewport centered on the device.  The default value
of \fBfill\fR = yes means the plot spans equal amounts of NDC space in
x and y.  Setting
the value of \fBfill\fR  to "no" means the viewport will be adjusted so 
that the square plot will span equal physical lengths in x and y
when plotted.  That is, when \fBfill = no\fR, a unity aspect ratio is 
enforced, and plots
appear square regardless of the device aspect ratio.  On devices with non 
square full device viewports (e.g., the vt640), a plot drawn by \fIprow\fR
appears extended in the x direction unless \fBfill\fR = no.

EXAMPLES
1. Plot row 128 of image crab.5009 with default parameters:

.nf
    cl> prow crab.5009 128
.fi

2. Overplot row 128 of crab.red using crosses to mark the added points:

.nf
    cl> prow crab.red 128 append+ pointmode+ marker=cross
.fi

3. Annotate the axes of a row plot:

.nf
    cl> prow crab.5009 64 xlabel="Column Number" ylabel=Intensity
.fi

TIME REQUIREMENTS
\fIprow\fR takes about 1 cp second to plot a row of a 512 square image.
