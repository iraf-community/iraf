DESCRIPTION
Implot is an interactive, cursor driven task for examining images by plotting
the lines and columns or the averages of lines and columns.  A single image
line is plotted when the task is first run, then cursor mode is entered and
keystrokes may be used to generate additional line and column plots.  Carriage
return is typed to exit cursor mode and Implot.

The following single character keystrokes are recognized by Implot.  Note that
numerous additional keystrokes are provided by "cursor mode" itself, i.e.,
by the graphics system.  These additional keystrokes provide such standard
facilities as stepwise cursor motion, plot expansion, movies, disposal to a
batch plotter or metafile, and plot annotation facilties.  Cursor mode is
documented elsewhere.

The single character keystroke commands use the position to the cursor to
determine what region of the image to plot.  If the plot is examined carefully
one will note an extra scale on the right hand edge.  This scale gives the
"other" axis of the image in units of pixels.  For example, if the current
plot is a line plot (rather than a column plot), the X axis of the plot
will correspond to the X axis of the image, and the right Y axis of the plot
will correspond the the Y axis of the image.  Both axes will be scaled
linearly in units of pixels.  The left Y axis is scaled in either linear or
logarithmic pixel intensity units.  In the case of a column plot the bottom
axis will correspond to image Y and the right axis to image X.

The 'l' and 'c' keystrokes, used to plot lines and columns, take image
coordinates from the bottom and right axes of the plot.  In the case of a
lineplot, the cursor would be positioned in Y and the key 'l' typed to
plot a new line.  Extrapolation of this convention to the other cases and
keystrokes is self evident.  The 'a' keystroke is used to mark an X or Y
region to be averaged and plotted.  This mode of averaging is independent
of the ':a' command discussed below.

Successive vectors may be overplotted by typing an 'o' and then any other
command.  A range of linetypes are used if the device supports them to
make the curves easier to distinguish.  The position of each line is marked
on the right axis with a small tick to document the coordinates of the
curves.

The 'j' and 'k' commands are used to step through an image in either the
upward (k) or downward (j) directions, relative to the current line or
column plot.  Each new vector is plotted in place of the previous one
without clearing the screen, making it easy to compare successive vectors.

In addition to the single keystroke commands, the following : escape
commands are provided:


.ks
.nf
	:a N		set number of lines or columns to average
	:c N [M]	plot column N [average of columns N to M]
	:i imagename	open a new image for input
	:l N [M]	plot line N [average of lines N to M]
	:o		overplot
	:log+		log scale in Y
	:log-		turn off log scale in Y
	:step N		set step size for j,k
	:solid		overplot with solid, not dashed, lines
	:x x1 x2	fix range in X (call with no args to unfix)
	:y y1 y2	fix range in Y (call with no args to unfix)
.fi
.ke


The 'c' and 'l' commands are identical to the keystroke commands except
that the column or line position is explicitly entered rather than taken
from the cursor.  An averaging factor entered with 'a' will apply to all
subsequent line and column plots, as well as plots generated by 'j' and 'k'.
The input image may be changed at any time using the 'i' command; only one
image may be open at a time.  Log scaling on the Y axis may be turned on
and off with the 'log' commands.  The default step size of 1/10 the height
of the image may be changed with the 'step' command.  Finally, the 'solid'
command may be used to draw all overplotted curves using solid, rather than
dashed, line segments.

The 'x' and 'y' commands may be used to fix the plotting scale in either
X or Y, i.e., to disable autoscaling.  Once the scale is fixed on an axis
it remains fixed until either the fix scale command is repeated without
any arguments, or the 'e' option is used to expand the plot (this causes
the fixed scale to be lost).  Plotting different lines or columns or even
changing images does not cause loss of fixed scaling.  If the X scale is
fixed to a range less than an entire line or column Y autoscaling, if enabled,
will only pertain to the displayed range in X.

EXAMPLES
1. Enter cursor mode, plotting line 240 of the 300x480 image 'crab':

.nf
	cl> implot crab
	(plot appears)
.fi

Type '?' to get the list of recognized keystrokes.  Move the cursor and
type 'l' to plot the line at the Y position of the cursor.  Try typing 'c'
to plot a column (note that a column plot will take longer than a line
plot since the entire image must be read).  Go back to a line plot and
try several 'k' keystrokes to step up through the image.  Try a cursor
mode 'E' to playback a movie of a small region, then type 0 (zero) to
restore the original plot.

BUGS
It should be possible to use the image display cursor to mark the lines or
columns to be plotted.  This capability will be added when the image display
is interfaced to GIO (the IRAF graphics subsystem).
