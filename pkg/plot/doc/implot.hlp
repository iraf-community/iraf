NAME
implot -- plot lines and columns of images
.ih
USAGE
implot image [line]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
List of images to be plotted.  If more than one image is in the list then
the 'm' and 'n' keys are used proceed to the previous and next image.
.le
.ls line
If given, the number of the image line to be plotted, otherwise the central
line is plotted.
.le
.ls wcs = "logical"
The world coordinate system (\fIwcs\fR) to be used for axis labeling.
The following standard world systems are predefined.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are image pixel coordinates relative to the image currently
being displayed.
.le
.ls physical
The physical coordinate system is invariant with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image matrix.  For example, if the reference
image was created by extracting a section of another image, the physical
coordinates of an object in the reference image will be the pixel coordinates
of the same object in the original image.  The physical coordinate system
thus provides a consistent coordinate system (a given object always has the
same coordinates) for all images, regardless of whether any user world
coordinate systems have been defined.
.le
.ls world
The "world" coordinate system is the \fIcurrent default WCS\fR.
The default world system is the system named by the environment variable
\fIdefwcs\fR if defined in the user environment and present in the reference
image WCS description, else it is the first user WCS defined for the image
(if any), else physical coordinates are returned.
.le

In addition to these three reserved WCS names, the name of any user WCS
defined for the reference image may be given.  A user world coordinate system
may be any linear or nonlinear world system.
.le
.ls step = 0
Step size for stepping through lines or columns in an image with the
'j' and 'k' keys.  If zero or INDEF the step defaults to ~10% of the
image axis length.  This parameter may be changed interactively with
a colon command.

DESCRIPTION
Implot is an interactive, cursor driven task for examining images by plotting
the lines and columns or the averages of lines and columns.  An image
line is plotted when the task is first run, then cursor mode is entered and
keystrokes may be used to generate additional line and column plots.  'q'
is typed to exit cursor mode and implot and 'n' is typed to proceed to
the next image in the input image list.

The following single character keystrokes are recognized by Implot.  Note that
numerous additional keystrokes are provided by "cursor mode" itself, i.e.,
by the graphics system.  These additional keystrokes provide such standard
facilities as stepwise cursor motion, plot expansion, movies, disposal to a
batch plotter or metafile, and plot annotation facilities.  Cursor mode is
documented elsewhere.

The single character keystroke commands use the position to the cursor to
determine what region of the image to plot.  If the plot is examined carefully
one will note an extra scale on the right hand edge.  This scale gives the
"other" axis of the image in units of pixels.  For example, if the current
plot is a line plot (rather than a column plot), the X axis of the plot
will correspond to the X axis of the image, and the right Y axis of the plot
will correspond to the Y axis of the image.  Both axes will be scaled
linearly in units of pixels.  The left Y axis is scaled in either linear or
logarithmic pixel intensity units.  In the case of a column plot the bottom
axis will correspond to image Y and the right axis to image X.

The 'l' and 'c' keystrokes, used to plot lines and columns, take image
coordinates from the bottom and right axes of the plot.  In the case of a
lineplot, the cursor would be positioned in Y and the key 'l' typed to
plot a new line.  Extrapolation of this convention to the other cases and
keystrokes is self evident.  The 'a' keystroke is used to mark an X or Y
region to be averaged and plotted.  This mode of averaging is independent
of the ':a' command discussed below.

Successive vectors may be overplotted by typing an 'o' and then any other
command.  A range of linetypes are used if the device supports them to
make the curves easier to distinguish.  The position of each line is marked
on the right axis with a small tick to document the coordinates of the
curves.

The 'j' and 'k' commands are used to step through an image in either the
upward (k) or downward (j) directions, relative to the current line or
column plot.  Each new vector is plotted in place of the previous one
without clearing the screen, making it easy to compare successive vectors.
The step between vectors may be defined by a task parameter and
changed by a colon command.

The 'm' and 'n' commands are used to step through the input image list.
This is the same as using the 'i' key to switch images and the 'l' key
to plot the same line or column as the previous image.

There are three keys which print various quantities of interest.
The space bar key will read the cursor position, find the nearest pixel,
and report the image line and column, the coordinate along the current
axis, and the pixel value.  The line and column are in logical pixels
(that is the coordinates in the current image section) and the
coordinates are in the selected world coordinate system and printed
in the current coordinate format.  If the selected world coordinate
system is "logical" then the coordinate will be the same as the line
or column.

The 's' key requires two cursor positions and then computes statistics of
the region.  The values are the median, mean, sigma, sum, and number of
pixels.  The 'p' key also requires two cursor positions with the x
positions defining a region and the y positions defining a linear
background.  Within the defined region the peak departure from the
background (either above or below the background) is found and the full
width at half maximum of this peak is measured.  The linear background, the
peak position and distance from the background and the widths at half the
peak value are overplotted on the data.  In addition to the profile
quantities the moments of the background subtracted data are measured.  The
moments computed are the centroid, the integral (or flux), the width, and
the normalized asymmetry.  The width reported is the square root of the
second central moment multiplied by 2.35482.  For a gaussian profile this
corresponds to the full width at half maximum which can be compared with
the direct measure of the profile width.  The normalized asymmetry is the
third central moment divided by the 3/2 power of the second central
moment.  The various measurements are printed on the status line.  There
are multiple lines of results which are scrolled using the '/' key.

In addition to the single keystroke commands, the following : escape
commands are provided:


.ks
.nf
	:a N		set number of lines or columns to average
	:c N [M]	plot column N [average of columns N to M]
	:f format	set the x coordinate numerical format
	:i imagename	open a new image for input
	:l N [M]	plot line N [average of lines N to M]
	:o		overplot
	:log+		log scale in Y
	:log-		turn off log scale in Y
	:step N		set step size for j,k
	:solid		overplot with solid, not dashed, lines
	:w wcsname	change world coordinate systems
	:x x1 x2	fix range in X (call with no args to unfix)
	:y y1 y2	fix range in Y (call with no args to unfix)
.fi
.ke


The 'c' and 'l' commands are identical to the keystroke commands except
that the column or line position is explicitly entered rather than taken
from the cursor.  An averaging factor entered with 'a' will apply to all
subsequent line and column plots, as well as plots generated by 'j' and 'k'.
The input image may be changed at any time using the 'i' command; only one
image may be open at a time.  Log scaling on the Y axis may be turned on
and off with the 'log' commands.  The default step size of 1/10 the height
of the image may be changed with the 'step' command.  Finally, the 'solid'
command may be used to draw all overplotted curves using solid, rather than
dashed, line segments.

The 'x' and 'y' commands may be used to fix the plotting scale in either
X or Y, i.e., to disable autoscaling.  Once the scale is fixed on an axis
it remains fixed until either the fix scale command is repeated without
any arguments, or the 'e' option is used to expand the plot (this causes
the fixed scale to be lost).  Plotting different lines or columns or even
changing images does not cause loss of fixed scaling.  If the X scale is
fixed to a range less than an entire line or column Y autoscaling, if enabled,
will only pertain to the displayed range in X.

The numerical format for the coordinate labels are set with the 'f'
command.  The values may be "" (an empty string), %f for decimal format, %h
and %H for xx:xx:xx format, and %m and %M for xx:xx.x format.  The upper
case %H and %M convert degrees to hours.  Some images have a recommended x
coordinate format defined as a WCS attribute.  If the format value is ""
(the default) the WCS attribute format will be used.  Any other value will
override the image attribute.

EXAMPLES
1. Enter cursor mode, plotting line 240 of the 300x480 image 'crab':

.nf
	cl> implot crab
	(plot appears)
.fi

Type '?' to get the list of recognized keystrokes.  Move the cursor and
type 'l' to plot the line at the Y position of the cursor.  Try typing 'c'
to plot a column (note that a column plot will take longer than a line
plot since the entire image must be read).  Go back to a line plot and
try several 'k' keystrokes to step up through the image.  Try a cursor
mode 'E' to playback a movie of a small region, then type 0 (zero) to
restore the original plot.

BUGS
It should be possible to use the image display cursor to mark the lines or
columns to be plotted.  This capability will be added when the image display
is interfaced to GIO (the IRAF graphics subsystem).
