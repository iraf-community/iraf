DESCRIPTION
Task \fIsgikern\fR translates GKI metacode into a much simpler format and
then calls up a host system task to dispose of the intermediate file to a
plotter device.  The SGI kernel can generate as output either an SGI metacode
file, used to drive laser plotters and pen plotters, or a bitmap file, used
to drive raster graphics devices.  Both types of files have a very simple
format, making it straightforward to implement interfaces for new devices.

The SGI/SGK \fBmetacode format\fR is a sequence of 16 bit integer values encoded
in the machine independent MII format (twos complement, most significant byte
first).  The SGI kernel reduces all IRAF plotting instructions to only four
SGK metacode instructions, i.e.:

.ks
.nf
	opcode  arguments                description

	   1      0    0		start a new frame
	   2      X    Y                move to (x,y)
	   3      X    Y                draw to (x,y)
	   4      W    0                set line width (>= 1)
.fi
.ke

All coordinates are specified in GKI NDC units in the range 0-32767.  Note that
all metacode instructions are the same length.  All text generation, line type
emulation, mark drawing, etc., is done in the higher level IRAF software.
The metacode file is a standard IRAF random access (non record structured)
binary file.

The \fBbitmap format\fR written by the SGK is even simpler than the metacode
format.  Output consists either of a single binary raster file containing one
or more bitmaps with no embedded header information, or a set of binary files
with the same root name and the extensions .1, .2, etc., each of which contains
a single bitmap.  All bitmaps the same size.  The size is specified in the
graphcap entry for the device and may be passed to the host dispose task on
the foreign task command line if desired.  Page offsets may also be passed on
the command line, e.g., to position the plot on the plotter page.

The following graphcap fields apply to both metacode and bitmap devices.

.ks
.nf
	DD	host command to dispose of metacode file ($F)
	DB	have the kernel print debug messages during execution
	RM	boolean; if present, SGK will delete metacode file
	MF	multiframe count (max frames per job)
	NF	store each frame in a new file (one frame/file)
	RO	rotate plot (swap x and y)
	YF	y-flip plot (flip y axis) (done after rotate)
.fi
.ke

The following additional fields are defined for bitmap devices.

.ks
.nf
	BI	boolean; presence indicates a bitmapped or raster device
	LO	width in device pixels of a line of size 1.0
	LS	difference in device pixels between line sizes
	PX	physical x size of bitmap as stored in memory, bits
	PY	physical y size of bitmap, i.e., number of lines in bitmap
	XO,YO	origin of plotting window in device pixels
	XW,YW	width of plotting window in device pixels
	NB	number of bits to be set in each 8 bit byte output
	BF	bit-flip each byte in bitmap (easier here than later)
	BS	byte swap the bitmap when output (swap every two bytes)
	WS	word swap the bitmap when output (swap every four bytes)
.fi
.ke

The multiframe count (MF) limits the number of frames per job, where a job
refers to the dispose command submitted to the host to process the frames.
If the new file flag (NF) is absent, all frames will be stored in the same
physical file (this holds for both metacode and bitmap frames).  If the new
file flag (NF) is set, each frame will be stored in a separate file, with
the N files having the names $F.1, $F.2, ... $F.N, where $F is the unique
(root) filename generated from the template given in the DD string.  The $F
is replaced by the root filename, rather than by a list of all the filenames,
to keep the OS command to a reasonable length and to permit the use of host
file templates to perform operate upon the full set of files (and to avoid
having to choose between spaces and commas to delimit the filenames).
For example, if MF=8 and NF=yes, then "$F.[1-8]" will match the file set
on a UNIX host.  The template "$F.*" is less precise but would also work.

The values of graphcap device capability fields may also be substituted
symbolically when building up the dispose command.  If the sequence
$(\fICC\fR) is encountered in the dispose command template, the string
value of the capability \fICC\fR will be substituted.  For example, given
the sequence "-w $(xr)" and the graphcap capability entry ":xr#1024:",
the output sequence would be "-w 1024".  This feature is particularly
useful when several high level device entries include (via "tc=device")
a generic device entry.  The DD string in the generic entry may substitute
the values of device parameters defined differently in the high level
entries; this avoids the need to duplicate an almost identical DD string
in several device entries.

The output raster will consist of PY lines each of length PX bits.  If PX is
chosen to be a multiple of 8, there will be PX/8 bytes per line of the output
raster.  Note that the values of PX and PY are arbitrary and should be chosen
to simplify the code of the translator and maximize efficiency.  In particular,
PX and PY do not in general define the maximum physical resolution of the
device, although if NB=8 the value of PX will typically approximate the
physical resolution in X.  If there are multiple bitmap frames per file,
each frame will occupy an integral number of SPP char units of storage in the
output file, with the values of any extra bits at the end of the bitmap being
undefined (a char is 16 bits on most IRAF host machines).

The plot will be rasterized in a logical window XW one-bit pixels wide and YW
pixels high.  The first YO lines of the output raster will be zero, with the
plotting window beginning at line YO+1.  The first XO bits of each output line
will be zeroed, with the plotting window beginning at bit XO+1.  The bytes in
each output line may be bit-flipped if desired, and all of the bits in each
output byte need not be used for pixel data.  If the bit packing factor NB is
set to 8 the plotting window will map into XW bits of storage of each output
line.  If fewer than 8 bits are used in each output byte more than XW physical
bits of storage will be used, e.g., if NB=4, XW*2 bits of storage are required
for a line of the plotting window.  The unused bits are set to zero.  The
translator can later "or" a mask into the zeroed bits, flip the data bits,
or perform any other bytewise operation using simple lookup table mapping
techniques.

The DD entry consists of three fields delimited by commas, i.e., the device
name, including node name (not used at present for this kernel), the VOS
root filename to be used to make a temporary file to contain the output (note
that this is NOT a host filename), and lastly the command to be sent to the
host system to dispose of the output metacode file or bitmap file to the
plotter device.

EXAMPLES
1. Convert the GIO/GKI metacode file "dev$mc" into an SGI format metacode file.

2. The same GIO/GKI metacode file read in the previous example ("dev$mc") can
be plotted on the SGI device "qms_sgi".
