NAME
nsppkern -- draw metacode on an NSPP interfaced plotter device
.ih
USAGE
nsppkern input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input metacode files.
.le
.ls device = "nsppdefault"
The NSPP interfaced plotting device output is to be directed to.
.le
.ls generic = no
The remaining parameters are ignored when \fBgeneric\fR = yes.
.le
.ls debug = no
If \fBdebug\fR = yes, the graphics instructions are decoded and printed
during processing.
.le
.ls verbose = no
If \fBverbose\fR = yes, the elements of polylines, cell arrays, etc. will
be printed in debug mode.
.le
.ls gkiunits = no
By default, coordinates are printed in NDC rather than GKI units.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Task \fInsppkern\fR translates metacode and draws it on a plotting
device.
Input is GKI metacode, which can be read from one or more binary
files or redirected from the standard input.

If \fBdebug\fR is set to yes, the plotting instructions are printed in
readable form during processing.
If \fBverbose\fR = yes, elements of polyline and cell array calls are
printed in addition to the default debug output.
Coordinates can be printed in either GKI (0 - 32767) or NDC (0.0 - 1.0)
units.

EXAMPLES
1. Extract the fourth frame from metacode file "oned.mc" and plot it.

.nf
    cl> gkiextract oned.mc 4 | nsppkern
.fi

2. Plot metacode frame "contour.demo" in debug mode, so the plotting
instructions can be read as they are processed.

.nf
    cl> nsppkern contour.demo debug+
.fi
