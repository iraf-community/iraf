USAGE

.nf
scan  (p1, p2, p3 ... pn)
fscan (param, p1, p2, p3, ... pn)
scanf  (format, p1, p2, p3 ... pn)
fscanf (param, format, p1, p2, p3, ... pn)

PARAMETERS
.ls pN
The name of an output parameter, to receive a scanned value.
.le
.ls param
The name of the input parameter whose \fIvalue\fR is to be scanned to
produce the output values.
.le
.ls format
A C-like format specification string containing plain characters, which 
which must match exactly what's on the input stream, and conversion 
specifications,
each of which causes conversion and scanning of zero or more \fIargs\fR.

DESCRIPTION
\fIScan\fR, \fIscanf\fR, \fIfscan\fR,
and \fIfscanf\fR permit the user to read in values from the
standard input, a file, or a parameter and assign them to the listed parameters.
\fIFscan\fR or \fIfscanf\fR may also be used to read a string already in core.
It is useful to consider these functions as performing two disjoint actions:
acquiring a string, where \fIscan/scanf\fR and \fIfscan/fscanf\fR differ; 
and parsing the string, where they are identical.

\fIScan/scanf\fR acquires its string by reading exactly one 
line from the standard
input.  The action of \fIfscan/fscanf\fR depends on \fIparam\fR.  
If \fIparam\fR is
a string, or a struct, then the string is simply the value of \fIparam\fR.
If, however, \fIparam\fR is a list-directed struct, a call to \fIfscanfscanf\fR
will get the next line from the file pointed to by \fIparam\fR.
The file can be rewound by assigning a file name to \fIparam\fR.
If either scan or fscan reach an EOF, they return with the value EOF and
do not change any parameters.

Once the string has been acquired it is parsed into segments delimited by
spaces or tabs in the case of \fIscan\fR or \fIfscan\fR, or when using
\fIscanf\fR and \fIfscanf\fR with no field width specification for the
field formats.
\fIScan\fR and \fIfscan\fR do not recognize quoted strings, nor do they
view ',' as a delimiter.  The formatted scan functions scanf and fscanf
recognize ',' as a delimiter in the case of numeric conversion only.
Each token is then assigned in turn to p1 through
pn.  If there are too many tokens they are discarded, if there are too
few, the corresponding parameters are not affected by the call.
Any conversion error terminates the scan, but parameters already scanned
retain their new values.  An assignment to a struct terminates the scan
because the entire unscanned portion of the string is assigned to the
struct.  Thus any struct should be the last parameter in a scan or
fscan call.

Scan/scanf and fscan/fscanf are intrinsic functions returning either EOF 
if end of 
file on the input list is sensed, or the number of parameters successfully
scanned.  The function \fInscan\fR also returns the number of parameters
successfully scanned in the last call to scan or fscan.

A field format specification has the form "%[*][W][lh]C", where '*' indicates
the field should be skipped, W is  the  field width,
'l' indicates longword output, 'h' indicates halfword output, and
C is the format code.  The format codes C are as follows:

.nf
       c    single character (c or '\c' or '\0nnn')
       d    decimal integer
       e    exponential format
       f    fixed format
       g    general format
       o    octal integer
       s    string
       x    hexadecimal integer
.fi

The W (field width) specification indicates the exact number of characters
to assign to the given argument, e.g. "%2s" would assign two characters of
an input string to a string variable even though the actual string might
contain more before a delimiting whitespace.  For numeric input, only W
digits, decimal points, or exponentiation characters are assigned, e.g.
"%3f" used on the string "1.23456" would result in a value of "1.2",
"%2d" used on the string "12345" would result in a value of "12", and so
on.  If no field width is specified all characters up to a delimiting
whitespace are used in the conversion, in the case of numeric data and a
numeric format characters up to a whitespace or non-numeric (including
decimal points and an 'e' or 'd' exponentiation character) are used.

EXAMPLES
1. Print a list of radii, given a list of coordinates.

.nf
	list = coords
	while (fscan (list, x, y) != EOF)
	    print (sqrt (x**2 + y**2))
.fi

2. Use a formatted scan of the standard input.

.nf
     cl> print ("1.234 5 7.34abc") | scanf ("%g %d %f %s", x, i, y, s1)
     cl> =x
     1.234
     cl> =i
     5
     cl> =y
     7.34
     cl> =s1
     abc
.fi

3. Use a formatted scan from a "list" parameter.

        fscanf (list, "%g %d %f %s", x, i, y, s1)

BUGS
The syntax of scan and fscan is peculiar, in that they are the only
functions where parameters are effectively passed by reference rather than by
value.  Thus p1, ... pn must be parameters whereas in similar contexts an
arbitrary expression can be used wherever a parameter can.
