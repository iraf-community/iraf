NAME
package -- define a new package
.ih
USAGE
package	pkgname
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls pkgname
The name of the new package to be created.  If called with no arguments,
\fIpackage\fR lists the currently defined packages in task search order.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIpackage\fR task creates a new package.
The newly defined package becomes the current package, and the prompt
is changed to use the first two characters of the package name.
The package command does not define any tasks within the package, that
is done by subsequent \fItask\fR declarations.  Subsequent \fItask\fR
declarations will add tasks to the task list for the new package.

The new package remains the "current package" until another \fIpackage\fR
command is entered, or until the task in which the package command was
entered is terminated.
Normally \fIpackage\fR will be used at the beginning of a script to define
the package name.  It will be followed by one or more task definitions,
and then by a \fIcl\fR or \fIclbye\fR to interpret user commands,
until the command \fIbye\fR is entered by the user, at which time the
package script task terminates, discarding the package and any associated
definitions.

EXAMPLES
1. The use of \fIpackage\fR in a package script task.

.nf
	package lists

	set	lists		= "pkg$lists/"

	task	table,
		tokens,
		unique,
		lintran,
		columns,
		words		= "lists$x_lists.e"

	task	$gcursor	= "lists$gcursor.cl"
	task	$imcursor	= "lists$imcursor.cl"
	task	average		= "lists$average.cl"

	clbye()
.fi

2. List the currently defined packages in the order in which they will
be searched for tasks.

.nf
	cl> pack
	clpackage
	language
	user
	system
.fi

.ih
BUGS
All active packages must have unique names.  To eliminate the possibility
of parameter file name collisions in UPARM, the three character string
formed by concatenating the first two and final characters of the package
name should be unique.
