DESCRIPTION
The CL maintains a list of environment variables, each of which consists
of a keyword = value pair.  The \fIset\fR and \fIreset\fR operators are used
to define new environment variables, or to set new values for old environment
variables.  The two operators are equivalent with the exception that if the
named environment variable is already defined, \fIset\fR will push a new,
temporary value for the variable, whereas \fIreset\fR will overwrite the most
recent definition of the variable.  Environment variables may be examined
using the \fIshow\fR task or the \fIenvget\fR intrinsic function.

A particular use for the environment variables is in the definition
of IRAF logical names for directories.  If an environment variable is set to
a string corresponding to a system-dependent directory name,
then the environment variable may then be used within the CL to
refer to that directory.

For example,

.nf
	set	testdir = "/usr/iraf/testdir"		# Unix
	set	testdir = "dua2:[iraf.testdir]"		# VMS
	task	tst1 = testdir$tst1.cl
.fi

New IRAF logicals may be defined in terms or existing IRAF logical names,
i.e., logical names are recursively expanded.

.nf
	set	subdir1 = testdir$subdir1/
	task	tst2 = subdir1$tst2.e
.fi

If the \fIset\fR command is entered without any arguments the current
environment list is printed in the reverse of the order in which the
definitions were made.  If a variable has been redefined both the
final and original definition are shown.   The \fIshow\fR command can be
used to show only the current value.

EXAMPLES
1. Define the data directory "dd" on a remote node, and call \fIimplot\fR
to make plots of an image which resides in the remote directory.

.nf
	cl> set dd = lyra!/u2/me/data
	cl> implot dd$picture
.fi

2. Temporarily change the value of the variable \fIprinter\fR.  The new
value is discarded when the \fIbye\fR is entered.

.nf
	cl> cl
	cl> set printer = qms
		...
	cl> bye
.fi
