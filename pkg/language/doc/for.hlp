DESCRIPTION
The \fIfor\fR statement provides a looping mechanism similar to the C-language
for loop.  \fIAssign1\fR and \fIassign2\fR are assignment statements using
one of the operators '=', '+=', '-=', '/=', '*='.  Any of the elements of
the \fIfor\fR loop may be omitted, except the parenthesis and colon field
delimiters.

EXAMPLES
1. For I equals zero to 10 in steps of 2, increment TOTAL by the value of
array element I.

.nf
	for (i=0;  i <= 10;  i += 2)
	    total += array[i]
.fi

2. Print the first eight powers of two.

.nf
	j = 1
	for (i=1;  i <= 8;  i += 1) {
	     print (i, j)
	     j *= 2
	}
.fi

BUGS
A simple assignment of the form i++ will not work.
Only one assignment statement is permitted in the first and third fields.
