ELEMENTS
.ls vartype
One of the legal variable types, i.e.:

	int, bool, char, real, gcur, imcur, struct, file
.le
.ls varname
The name of the variable or parameter.  The name must begin with
an alphabetic character or '_' and should be fewer than 64 characters
in length.  If the name is preceded by a '*', then the variable
is 'list-directed', meaning that a new value is taken from a list
each time the parameter is read.
.le
.ls index_list
The index_list consists of a series of ranges enclosed in square brackets.
A range may be a single integer in which case the range is from 1 to
that integer, or two integers separated by a colon.  The second integer
must be larger than the first.  Ranges are separated by commas. In
the special case that no ranges are specified by the user, the variable
is assumed to be a one-dimensional array with a  range from 1 to the
number of elements in the initialization list.
.le
.ls init_value
The initialization value is a single value for scalar parameters but
may be a list for array.  A repetition count may be specified in the form

	rep_count (value)

which is equivalent to value repeated the rep_count times.
The values in the initialization list are separated by commas.
.le
.ls options
.br
Options define certain characteristics of the variables.  Each
options has the form opt_name=value where value is a constant.
The current options are:
.ls mode
Determines whether the parameter is queried for and whether
it is learned after task execution.  The default mode for parameters
declared in the argument list of a CL procedure is "a", and "h" otherwise.
.le
.ls min
The minimum allowable value for the parameter.  If omitted, no min checking
is performed.
.le
.ls max
The maximum allowable value for the parameter.  If omitted, no max checking
is performed.
.le
.ls prompt
.br
The prompt to be used when the parameter is queried for.
.le
.ls enum
The set of allowable string values for a string valued parameter.
The character '|' delimits successive enumerated strings.
.le
.ls filetype
For a \fIfile\fR type parameter, a string containing characters giving
file characteristics to be checked for when the file parameter is used.
.ls
.nf
r	file exists and is readable
w	file exists and is writable
n	file does not exist
b	file is a binary file
t	file is a text file
.fi
.le
.le
.ls length
For a string type parameter, the number of characters of storage to
allocate for the string.  If the actual length of a string later exceeds
the allocated value the string will be silently truncated.
.le

Note that all string constants in an options list must be enclosed in
quotes.

DESCRIPTION
Declaration statements are used for inline declaration of parameters and
local variables.   A declaration after the begin statement of a procedure
script is a declaration of a local variable, but any other declaration
defines a parameter.  Parameters are generally saved between invocations
of a script while local variables are not.

Parameter and variable declarations should always precede executable
statements with a script.  Certain functions are legal before
declarations, but this depends upon certain hidden aspects of
declarations which are not obvious to the user.

EXAMPLES

.nf
real	x
int	ii=32
int	y {min=0, max=14}
char	z="abc" {enum="abc|def|ghi", mode="q"}

bool	isotest {YES, mode="ql",
	    prompt="Do you want to test for isotropy?"}

int	ii=1 {min=0,max=10, prompt="Number of images", mode="h"}
file	infile="testfile" {filetype="r"}
struct	line {length=80, mode="h"}

real	array[10]
int	iarray[15]=1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15 {min=0, max=100}
int	jarray[15] { 5(0), 5(2), 5(4), min=0, max=400}
char	carray[5]= 5("Junk")
bool	flags[4,-3:3] = 28(NO) {mode="h", prompt="Value set"}
file	inp_files[3]= "fil1.inp", "fil2.inp", "fil3.inp"

int	karray[3]=1	# (note second and third elements are undefined)
struct	*list="inputfile.list" {mode="q"}
int	*ilist="infile.inp" {mode="h", min=0, max=100}

BUGS

.nf
Options are only permitted for parameters, not local variables.
The filetype options are recognized but are not implemented internally.
