NAME
service -- respond to a parameter request from a bkg job
.ih
USAGE
service [job]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls job
A background job number (defaults to 1).
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
When a background job requires input from the terminal (e.g. if it queries
for a parameter), the job enters a stopped state, and a message is
displayed on the terminal.  At the user's convenience, he should respond
with a \fIservice\fR command specifying the appropriate job number.  The
\fIjobs\fR command can also be used to see what jobs require attention.

After entering the \fIservice\fR command, any prompt sent by the background
job is displayed, and the user may return a single line
of input to the background task.  Should more lines be needed several
\fIservice\fR calls may be necessary.  The user may service jobs in
any order, regardless of how the requests from the background jobs were
received.

EXAMPLE
1. Respond to a parameter request from job 3.

.nf
	cl> service 3
.fi

BUGS
If one never responds to a request for service from a background job, the job
will eventually time out and abort.  In principle it is possible to service
queued background jobs as well as interactive (subprocess) background jobs,
but in practice the request for service never reaches the terminal (and thus
the user), hence all parameters should be specified before submitting a job
to execute in a queue.
