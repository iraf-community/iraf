DESCRIPTION
\fIChdir\fR is used to change the current working directory.
When called without any arguments, \fIchdir\fR sets the default directory
to "home$", the users home directory.
The new directory can be specified as an IRAF logical name,
as a sub-directory of the current directory,
as a path from either a logical directory or the current directory,
or as an operating system dependent name.

The names \fIchdir\fR and \fIcd\fR are synonyms.  Note that the command
\fIback\fR may be called after a \fIchdir\fR to return to the previous
directory without typing its name.

.fi

4. From "dataio", go back up to "pkg" and down into "images".
