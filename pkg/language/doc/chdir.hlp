DESCRIPTION
\fIChdir\fR is used to change the current working directory.
When called without any arguments, \fIchdir\fR sets the default directory
to "home$", the users home directory.
The new directory can be specified as an IRAF logical name,
as a sub-directory of the current directory,
as a path from either a logical directory or the current directory,
or as an operating system dependent name.

The names \fIchdir\fR and \fIcd\fR are synonyms.  Note that the command
\fIback\fR may be called after a \fIchdir\fR to return to the previous
directory without typing its name.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Return to our home directory.

	cl> cd

2. Go to the package logical directory "pkg$".

	cl> chdir pkg

3. Go down one level to the directory "dataio", a subdirectory of "pkg".

	cl> cd dataio

4. From "dataio", go back up to "pkg" and down into "images".

	cl> cd ../images

5. Go to the "tv" directory, a subdirectory of "images", regardless of the
current directory

	cl> cd pkg$images/tv

6. On a VMS system, define a new logical directory on a different disk device
and go there.  Note that the character $ is not permitted in host file or
directory names.
