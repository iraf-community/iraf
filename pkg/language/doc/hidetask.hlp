NAME
hidetask -- hide a task from the user
.ih
USAGE
hidetask task,[task,...]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls task
The name of a task to be made hidden.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
If a task is only to be called from other tasks, and is not normally
invoked directly by the user, then it may be useful to `hide' the task,
i.e., omit it from the list of tasks listed in the "?" and "??" commands.
The \fIhidetask\fR command performs this function.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Define the task "_rew" and hide it from the user.  The purpose of the
leading underscore (not required) is to ensure that the user does not
accidentally run the task.

.nf
cl> task $_rew = "home$rew.e"
cl> hide _rew
.fi

2. Display the contents of the \fIlanguage\fR package, including all
hidden tasks (the _ does the trick).

.nf
cl> ?_ lan
    language:
