NAME
stty -- set/show terminal characteristics
.ih
USAGE
stty [terminal]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls terminal
The logical name of the terminal to be used, i.e., the name of the device
given in the \fIdev$termcap\fR file.
.le
.ls baud = 9600
Set to some nonzero value to inform the VOS of the baud rate; the software
does not automatically sense the baud rate.  The baud rate must be known to
accurately generate delays.
.le
.ls ncols = 80
The logical width of the screen in characters; may be set to some value less
than the physical width to produce more readable output on very high resolution
terminals.
.le
.ls nlines = 24
The logical height of the screen in characters.
.le
.ls show = no
Show the current terminal driver settings.  The \fIshow\fR function is
automatically enabled if \fIstty\fR is called with no arguments.
.le
.ls all = no
Show all terminal driver settings, including those which are not currently
in use.  Setting \fIall\fR automatically sets \fIshow\fR.
.le
.ls reset = no
Reset the terminal driver settings to their default (login time) values.
Note that the terminal driver is not a task in the normal sense but is always
active, and once a parameter is set the new value is retained indefinitely.
.le
.ls resize = no
Recompute the terminal screen size parameters, \fBttyncols\fR and
\fBttynlines\fR, and update their values in the environment.
If the terminal supports runtime querying of the screen size it will be
queried (allowing the screen size to change dynamically at runtime),
otherwise the values from the termcap entry for the terminal will be used.
.le
.ls clear = no
Clear the function(s) which follow on the command line, e.g.,
"clear ucasein ucaseout" is equivalent to "ucasein=no ucaseout=no".
.le
.ls ucasein = no
Map terminal input to lower case, e.g., when working on an old monocase
terminal, or on a modern terminal with the shiftlock key on.
.le
.ls ucaseout = no
Map terminal output to upper case.
.le
.ls login = "home$ttyin.log" [off]
Log all input from the terminal to the named text file.
.le
.ls logio = "home$ttyio.log" [off]
Log all terminal i/o to the named text file.  May not be used if either
\fIlogin\fR or \fIlogout\fR mode is in effect, and vice versa.
.le
.ls logout = "home$ttyout.log" [off]
Log all output to the terminal to the named text file.
.le
.ls playback = "home$ttyin.log" [off]
Divert terminal driver input to the named "stty login" style text file,
i.e., take input from a file instead of from the terminal.  The effect is
to exactly repeat a previous terminal session executed with \fIlogin\fR
mode in effect, e.g., to test or demo software.
.le
.ls verify = no
If \fIverify\fR is enabled during \fIplayback\fR mode the terminal driver
will read a key from the keyboard before executing each command in the
logfile.  Tap the space bar to execute the command, \fIq\fR to terminate
playback mode, or \fIg\fR to continue execution with \fIverify\fR mode
disabled.  Typing any other key causes a help line to be printed.
.le
.ls delay = 500 (msec)
If \fIverify\fR is disabled during \fIplayback\fR mode the terminal driver
will pause for \fIdelay\fR milliseconds before executing each logfile command.
.le

DESCRIPTION
The \fIstty\fR task is used to set or display the terminal device
characteristics and VOS terminal driver options.
Without arguments, \fIstty\fR prints the current characteristics of the
terminal.  The default terminal type can be changed by setting \fIttyname\fR.
The terminal characteristics \fIncols\fR, \fInlines\fR or \fIbaud\fR,
may be changed by typing new values explicitly on the command line.

The most common use of \fIstty\fR is to inform IRAF of the type of terminal
being used, e.g.,

.nf
	cl> stty vt100
.fi

would set the terminal type to "vt100".  An error message will be printed
unless an entry for the named terminal is present in the \fBtermcap\fR file;
if the named terminal is a graphics terminal, there must also be an entry
in the \fBgraphcap\fR file.

To find out about the current terminal settings, type

.ks
.nf
	cl> stty
.fi

or

.nf
	cl> stty all
.fi
.ke

A limited number of terminal driver options may also be set.  In particular,
the VOS terminal driver (not to be confused with the host operating system
terminal driver, a lower level facility) implements facilities for case
conversion upon input or output, and for logging all i/o to the terminal
and playing back a terminal session logged in a file.

.ih 4 1
Case Conversions
The \fBucasein\fR option, if set,
will cause all upper case terminal input to be mapped to lower
case (e.g., when working from an old monocase terminal).  In this mode,
individual upper case characters may be input by preceding them with the
escape character ^, e.g., "^MAKEFILE" equates to "Makefile".  The full set
of ^ escapes is summarized below.  The option \fBucaseout\fR will cause all
terminal output to be mapped to upper case.  Preceding either or both of
these option keywords by \fBclear\fR causes the options to be cleared.

.ks
.nf
	^	shift next character to upper case
	^+	shift lock (caps lock)
	^-	clear shift lock
	^^	the character ^
.fi
.ke

Case shifting is disabled in raw mode, e.g., while in cursor mode, and in
\fBeparam\fR.  All standard IRAF software, however, will sense that ucase
mode is set before entering raw mode, and will behave as expected.  Ucase mode
is also disabled by the STDGRAPH kernel whenever the graphics workstation is
activated.

Note that ^ is also the history meta-character, hence ^^ must be used when
in \fIucasein\fR mode to pass a single ^ to the CL history mechanism.
In cursor mode, upper case keystrokes are intercepted by cursor mode unless
escaped with a backslash.  Escaped keystrokes are mapped to lower case by
cursor mode if \fIucasein\fR mode is in effect, terminating cursor mode and
returning a lowercase key to the applications program.

.ih
Recording Terminal I/O
The terminal driver options \fBlogio\fR, \fBlogout\fR, and \fBlogin\fR
may be used to log, respectively, all terminal i/o, all output to the terminal,
or all input from the terminal.  The logfile names are "home$ttyin.log",
"home$ttyout.log", or "home$ttyio.log", unless a different logfile name is
specified by the user.  All logfiles are standard textfiles containing only
printable characters.

Terminal i/o logging is especially useful for debugging \fItermcap\fR and
\fIgraphcap\fR entries for new terminals.  All IRAF terminal i/o is logged,
including raw mode i/o and graphics output.  Terminal i/o from foreign tasks
or OS escapes is not logged since these tasks bypass the VOS to talk directly
to the user terminal.

Each sequence of characters read from or written to the terminal (via a zgettt
or zputtt call to the driver) appears as one logical line of text in the
logfile, delimited by the data character \n (newline).
When reading from a terminal in raw mode, each input character will appear
on a separate line in the logfile with no newline, since only a single
data character is read at a time during raw mode input.
All control characters embedded in the data, including newline terminators,
are rendered into printable form.  Long lines are broken near the right margin,
adding an escaped newline and indenting continuation lines 4 spaces.

Terminal i/o logging is intended primarily for debugging purposes, rather
than for logging user commands; the IRAF command language provides a more
user friendly facility for command logging (see the \fIlanguage.logging\fR
manpage for further information on the CL command logging facilities).
All unprintable ASCII codes are rendered in the logfile in a printable form
intended to eliminate any ambiguity regarding the exact sequence of characters
sent to or received from the terminal.  In addition to the standard escape
sequences \n, \t, \r, etc., the following special escape sequences are used:

.ks
.nf
	\\		\
	\^		^
	^@		NUL (ascii 000)
	^[A-Z]		ctrl/a - ctrl/z (ascii 001 - 032)
	^[		ESC (ascii 033)
	^\		FS  (ascii 034)
	^]		GS  (ascii 035)
	^^		RS  (ascii 036)
	^_		US  (ascii 037)
	\s		blank (ascii 040)
	\<newline>	long i/o record continued on next line
.fi
.ke

These special escape sequences, plus any ordinary characters, constitute the
\fIdata\fR recorded in the logfile.  The following additional escape
sequences are used to record information about the logging session itself in
the logfile.

.ks
.nf
	\#		rest of line is a comment
	\T		terminal device name at log time
	\G		stdgraph device name at log time
	\O		timestamp written at start of log session
.fi
.ke

Any whitespace (unescaped blanks, tabs, or newlines) appearing
in the logfile is put there only to make the file more readable, and is not
considered data.  Blocks of text may be enclosed in a logfile delimited by
escaped curly brackets, i.e., "\{ ... \}".  This is used for the \fBplayback\fR
facility described in the next section.  

.ih
Playback of Terminal Sessions
The terminal driver has the capability not only of recording terminal i/o
in a file, but of taking input from a logfile to repeat a sequence of commands
previously entered by the user with terminal input logging enabled.
Note that we are not talking about simply playing back recorded output,
but of actually executing an arbitrary sequence of commands formerly entered
by the user.  This is different from executing a sequence of commands entered
into, for example, a CL script, because \fIall\fR input is recorded,
including not only the commands, but also all responses to parameter queries,
all rawmode keystroke input, and all graphics cursor input occurring
interactively during execution of the recorded commands.
These \fBplayback scripts\fR are useful for preparing automated demos or
tutorials of complex software, and for preparing scripts to be used to
automatically test software.

The basic sequence used to record and later playback a terminal session is as
follows:

.ks
.nf
	cl> stty login [= logfilename]
		<execute an arbitrary sequence of commands>
	cl> stty clear login			# or stty reset
	cl> stty playback [= logfilename]
.fi
.ke

Naturally, the playback script must be executed in the same context as when
the script was generated, i.e., one must ensure that all necessary packages
have been loaded, that the current directory has been set to the proper
value if it matters, and so on.  It is not necessary to execute a playback
script on the same type of video terminal or graphics terminal as was
used when the script was recorded; since only the terminal input is being
recorded, playback scripts are device independent and may be played back on
any terminal.

If desired the commands necessary to establish the starting context may be
recorded as part of the script.  If the script is going to be repeatedly
executed it may also be desirable to include commands at the end of the
recording session to clean up, e.g., deleting any temporary files created
during the recording session.  If anything has changed which causes a command
to abort during execution of a playback script, normal terminal input is
automatically restored, aborting the script.   Note that if the "stty playback"
command gets into the playback script for some reason, e.g., because the
"stty reset" (or "stty login=no" etc.) was omitted, then the script will
repeat indefinitely.  This may or may not be what was desired.

Two \fBstty\fR command line arguments are provided for controlling the
execution of a playback script.  By default, when a script is played back
the terminal driver will pause for \fBdelay\fR milliseconds after echoing
the command to be executed, to give the user watching the playback a chance
to read the command.  Aside from this programmed delay, execution is fully
automated.  For example,

.nf
	cl> stty play=filename delay=2000
.fi

would playback the file "filename", with a delay of 2 seconds following echo
of each line of recorded input text.

Alternatively, the user may request that the driver pause and wait for the
user to type a key before executing each logged command (i.e., before
returning each input line of text to the application).  This is called the
\fBverify\fR option.  In verify mode, the following keystrokes may be
entered to continue execution:

.ks
.nf
	space, return		continue execution
	'g'			go: turn verify mode off and continue
	'q'			quit: terminate playback mode
.fi
.ke

Verify mode is automatically disabled during raw mode input since the input
consists of single characters and an inordinate number of verification
keystrokes would be required from the user.  Either of the \fBverify\fR or
\fBdelay\fR options may be overridden by control directives embedded in the
playback text, as we shall see in the next section.

.ih
Customizing Playback Scripts
Although playback scripts may be and often are generated and played back
without ever looking at or modifying the actual playback script, there are
cases where it may be desirable to do so.  For example, when generating a
script to be used as a demo or tutorial, it may be desirable to insert
explanatory text into the script to be printed out on the terminal when
the script is played back, to explain to the person running the script what
is going on.  Likewise, it may be desirable to control the verify and delay
options at a granularity finer than the entire script.

Explanatory text and/or playback control directives may be inserted into the
script using the following construct:

	"\{" [<control_directives>] [<text>] "\}"

where \fBcontrol_directive\fR refers to one of the following:

.ks
.nf
	%V+		turn verify on
	%V-		turn verify off
	%NNN		set \fBdelay\fR to NNN milliseconds
.fi
.ke

For example,

.ks
.nf
	dir\{%5000
	[list the current directory]\}\n
.fi
.ke

would cause the following to be output, followed after a 5 second delay by a 
listing of the current directory (the "<>" is not printed, but shows where
the cursor will be during the 5 second pause):

.ks
.nf
	cl> dir
	[list the current directory]<>
.fi
.ke

Note that the newline following the "\{%5000" in the above example is textual
data, and will be output to the terminal along with whatever follows, up until
the closing brace, i.e., "\}".  The amount of text to be output may be
arbitrarily large; there is a builtin limit (currently 4096 characters),
but it is unlikely that this limit will ever be exceedd, since no more than
one pageful of text should ever be output in a single call.

Normally, a %V or %NNN control directive refers only to the input record
with which the enclosing \{...\} control block is associated.  The global
value of \fIverify\fR or \fIdelay\fR is temporarily overridden for the
current record.  If desired, the global value may instead be permanently
modified by adding a ! after the %, e.g.,

	\{%!V-%3000...\}

would permanently disable \fIverify\fR (unless a %V+ or %!V+ directive
follows later in the script) then output the text "..." followed by a 3
second delay.

To know where to insert the control directives into a script, it is
important to understand that input from the script is \fBrecord oriented\fR,
and that a control directive refers to the input record with which it is
associated.  An input record is a single \fIlogical\fR line of text in the
input file.  Note that a logical line of text may span multiple physical lines,
if the newlines are escaped or present as textual data within a control
directive.  The position of the control directive within the input record
determines where the explanatory text will be positioned relative to the
input text, when both are echoed to the terminal.  Any programmed delay or
pause will always occur after echoing the full record on the terminal.

.ih
Raw Mode Playback
When a program is executing which reads from the terminal in raw mode,
each character is read from the terminal as soon as it is typed, and
input characters are not echoed to the terminal unless the application
explicitly does the echoing.  Examples of programs which use raw mode input are
\fIeparam\fR and \fIpage\fR, which are keystroke driven, and any program
which reads the \fBgraphics cursor\fR, since a graphics cursor read uses raw
mode input.

Playback works much the same for raw input mode as for line input mode,
except that during raw mode input the input records normally consist of
single characters, rather than entire lines of text.  By default, \fBverify\fR
is turned off while reading from the terminal in raw mode, to avoid having
the user verify each individual character.  Also, the terminal driver will not
echo text read from the playback file in raw mode, since the text would not
have been echoed if playback were not in effect.

.ih
Cursor Reads in Playback Mode
A typical Tektronix style cursor read will look something like the following,
as recorded in an \fBstty login\fR script file following a recording session:

.ks
.nf
	K
	3
	)
	'
	*
	\r
.fi
.ke

This six character sequence consists of the key value of the cursor read (K),
followed by the [x,y] cursor coordinate encoded as four ascii characters
("3)'*" in this case), followed by the "GIN mode terminator" character or
characters, normally a single CR (\r).  Of course, if the terminal is not a
Tektronix compatible terminal (e.g., DEC-Regis), the details will differ
from this example.

The single character per line format of a cursor read reflects the fact that
each input record is a single character when reading from the terminal in
raw mode.  For the purposes of playback, however, such a sequence may be
reformatted on a single line if desired, to improve the readability of a
script (the extra whitespace in the second example is ignored, since if a
space were data it would appear as \s).

.ks
.nf
	K3)'*\r
or
	K 3 ) ' * \r
or
	K
	3)'*
	\r
etc.
.fi
.ke

To set the values of the \fIverify\fR or \fIdelay\fR parameters for a cursor
read one may insert the \{...\} sequence anywhere before the \r delimiter
is returned to the application, e.g.,

	K3)'*\r\{%V+\}

would do, since the sequence shown forms one logical input record in the
playback file, and the control directive included will be processed before
any input data characters from the record are returned to the application.
If the multi-line form of a cursor read is used, the control directive may
be tacked onto any of the records K through \r in the example.

Output of explanatory text in an interactive graphics session is a little
more tricky, since if one is not careful the text will come out while in
graphics mode, causing it to be rendered as random lines drawn all over the
screen.  A safe technique for outputting comments during playback of a
graphics session is to output the text to the \fBstatus line\fR,
taking care of course to output only a single line of text at once
(since multiple lines written to the status line would rapidly flash by,
leaving only the last line visible on the screen).  We can do this by taking
advantage of the : command sequence, which can be used to put the terminal
temporarily into status line output mode.

.ks
.nf
	:####\r
	\{%5000
	This is a status line comment\}
	^U\177
.fi
.ke

For example, insertion of the above sequence between any two cursor reads
in a recorded interactive graphics session would cause the text
"This is a status line comment" to be written to the status line,
with normal execution of the script occurring after a 5 second delay
followed by erasure of the status line and exit from status line mode
(due to the ctrl/u and rubout inserted as data after the colon cursor read).

While executing an interactive graphics session via playback, cursor values
are read from the playback script instead of from the terminal, hence the
user never sees the actual cursor crosshairs on the screen.  To give the
user some idea of what is going on, the key values of successive cursor mode
keystrokes are echoed in ascii down the left side of the screen, starting at
the upper left.  The keystroke value is also echoed at the position of the
cursor, to indicate where the cursor crosshairs would have been in an actual
interactive session.

.ih
Sample Playback Script
We conclude with an example of a complete playback script which can be
entered into a file and played back to demonstrate some of the features of
the \fIimplot\fR task in the PLOT package (the PLOT package must already
be loaded).

.ih
BUGS
1. Note that, when working with a terminal which supports runtime querying
of the screen size, the screen size is queried when the \fBstty resize\fR
command is executed, rather than when the terminal screen actually changes size.
Hence, the screen size parameters printed by a command such as \fBstty show\fR
will not necessarily reflect the actual screen size.  \fBstty resize show\fR
queries the terminal for the screen size, hence should always be correct.
The screen size is automatically queried whenever the \fIpage\fR or \fIhelp\fR
tasks are run.

2. The terminal screen size is determined by querying the terminal for the
screen size, and reading the response back (this technique has the advantage
that it works remotely over IPC and network connections, and is host system
independent).  If the terminal does not respond for some reason, e.g.,
because the terminal type has been set improperly and the terminal does not
support the query function, then \fBstty\fR will hang.  Typing a carriage
return causes execution to resume, after which the error should be corrected.
