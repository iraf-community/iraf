NAME
tdelete -- Delete a table.
.ih
USAGE
tdelete table
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task deletes tables.
The input may be a general filename template,
including wildcard characters, or the name of a list file
(preceded by the "@" character) containing table names.

The task checks that the file to be deleted really is a table
before deleting it.
In order to protect against accidental deletion of files other than tables,
text tables may be deleted using 'tdelete' only if 'verify = yes'.
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls table [file name template]
A list of one or more tables to be deleted.
.le
.ls (verify = no) [boolean]
Prompt for confirmation before deleting?  It is possible to delete
text tables using 'tdelete' if 'verify' is set to "yes".
.le
.ls (default_action = yes) [boolean]
Default action for the verify query.  If 'default_action = yes', then the
prompt will come back with "yes?" and striking return will proceed with
the delete.
.le
.ls go_ahead = yes [boolean]
This is a copy of 'default_action' used for prompting if 'verify = yes'.
This parameter is set by the task, it copies the value of 'default_action',
but cannot be directly set by the user.

EXAMPLES
1. Delete a single table.

.nf
	cl> tdelete table
.fi

2. Delete several tables.

.nf
	cl> tdelete table1,table2,tab67
	cl> tdelete *.tab,a,b,c

.fi
In the latter case, the extension is given explicitly because there may be
other files beginning with "tab" that are not tables.

3. Delete a list of tables using verify.

.nf
	cl> tdelete fits*.tab ver+
	cl> delete table `fits1.tab' ? (yes): yes
	cl> delete table `fits2.tab' ? (yes): yes
	cl> delete table `fits3.tab' ? (yes): yes
.fi
.ih
BUGS
Text tables cannot be deleted by 'tdelete' unless 'verify' is set to yes.
