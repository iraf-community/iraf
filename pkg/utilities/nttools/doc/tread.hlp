NAME
tread -- View a table (read only).

USAGE

DESCRIPTION
The 'tread' task is a read-only version of 'tedit', the screen editor for STSDAS
tables.  'tread' lets you view a table by moving the cursor around the
screen with the cursor keys.  The screen scrolls both sideways and up
and down as you move the cursor, so all elements of the table can be
reached. Other editing commands are entered on the command line. To
switch from table editing mode to command line mode, you press the
exit key (generally bound to Control-Z, though this can be changed).  
When your 
command is completed, the editor returns to table editing mode, unless
the command exits the editor. The most important commands in command
mode are `help' and `exit'. The `help' command displays all the
editing key bindings and the command line commands. The `exit' command
will get you out of the editor.

Some editing commands are entered from the command line in command
mode. To get to command line mode, press the exit key (Control-Z). 
If you enter a 
blank line, the editor will
return to table editing mode. Some commands take arguments. They can
be included when the command is entered, or if they are omitted, the
editor will prompt you for their values. If the argument has embedded
blanks, the argument should be enclosed in quotes if passed on the
command line. No quotes should be used if the argument is entered
interactively. When the editor interactively prompts you for a command
argument it will also display a default value for the argument.
Pressing the return key gets the default value. Some command names are 
two
words long, for example, "find forward". Usually the second word is
optional and modifies the meaning of the first.  If the second word is
not optional and you omit it, the editor will prompt you for it. All
command names can be abbreviated to one or more letters. If the
command name is two words long, both words can be abbreviated to one
or more letters.

The following commands are used by 'tread':
.ls exit
Exit the table editor.
.le
.ls find <expression>
Find the next row in the table which makes <expression> true and move
the cursor to that row. The expression has the same syntax as an
expression in a Fortran if statement.  The variables in the expression
are column names. For more information on the syntax of the
expression, read the help for the 'tselect' task. The direction of the search 
depends 
upon previous find commands. By default the search direction is forward;
however, if a "find backwards" command has been executed previously, 
searches will be done in a backwards direction until a "find forward"
command is executed.
.le
.ls find forward <expression>
Find the next row in the table which makes <expression> true and move the
cursor to that row. The search is done in the forwards direction.
.le
.ls find backwards <expression>
Find the next row in the table which makes <expression> true and move the
cursor to that row. The search is done in the backwards direction.
.le
.ls goto <row> <column>
Move the cursor to <row> and <column>.
.le
.ls help
Display online help information for the table editor. The help includes 
a brief description of each command line command and the key bindings 
for table editing commands.
.le
.ls next
Repeat the previous find command, using the same expression and search 
direction that was used with it.
.le
.ls next forward
Repeat the previous find command, changing the search direction to 
forwards.
.le
.ls next backwards
Repeat the previous find command, changing the search direction to 
backwards.
.le
.ls quit
Exit the table editor.
.le

The bindings to the table editing keys are read from the edcap file.
This is the file that defines key bindings for the
parameter editor and history editor. The edcap file defines key
bindings that resemble those of commonly used text editors. Three
edcap files are distributed with IRAF. They define key bindings which
resemble EDT, Emacs, and vi. These edcap files are located in the 'dev$'
directory and have the extension '.ed'. The appropriate file is chosen
according to the value of the environment variable 'EDITOR'. If you
want to customize the key bindings of the table editor, copy the
appropriate edcap file from the 'dev$' directory to your 'home$' directory
and edit the second column. The table editor searches your
home directory first for the edcap file and if it does not find it,
searches the 'dev$' directory.

The table editor also uses the termcap file to determine the screen
size and the escape sequences used to modify the screen. There are
entries in the termcap file for almost all terminal types. The proper
entry is selected according to the environment variable terminal. To
change your terminal type or the screen size, use the IRAF 'stty'
command.

PARAMETERS
.ls table [string]
Name of the table to be edited. The editor checks for the
existence of the table and its access mode before editing. The table
must exist in order to edit it with 'tread'.
.le
.ls (columns = "") [string]
Names of the columns to be edited.
A null or blank string means edit all columns.
A column template consists of a list of either
column names or column patterns containing the usual pattern matching
meta-characters.  The names or patterns are separated by commas or
white space.  The list can be placed in a file and the name of the
file preceded by an "@" character.
If the first character in the column template is a bang (!),
all columns NOT named will be displayed.

The 'tlcol' task (with the 'nlist' parameter set to 1) may be used to generate a 
list of
column names so there is no question about spelling.  This list may be
edited to rearrange (or delete) the names, and then pass the list to this task 
by preceding the its file name with an "@", for example,  

.nf
tt> tedit junk columns=@colnames.lis
.fi
.le
.ls (silent = no) [boolean]
Turn off the bell indicating warning messages?
.le
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Display only the columns 'SHARP' and 'ROUND' from the table 'm12b.tab':
 
.nf
tt> tread m12b columns="SHARP,ROUND"
.fi
