NAME
tproduct -- Form the Cartesian product of two tables.
.ih
USAGE
tproduct intable1 intable2 outtable
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task creates an output table which is the Cartesian product of two input
tables. This Cartesian product consists of every possible combination of the
rows of the two input tables. Therefore, the number of rows in the output table
is the product of the number of rows in the two input tables. The output table
will contain all the columns from both input tables. If a column name in the
first input table is the same as a column name in the second input table, this
task tries to create a unique name by appending "_1" to the first name and "_2"
to the second name. If the task cannot create a unique name in this way, it
stops with an error.
