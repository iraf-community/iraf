NAME
pltpar -- Edit the parameter set that describes plot attributes.
.ih
USAGE
pltpar
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The 'pltpar' parameters specify the attributes of plots drawn by the
'sgraph' task.

Note that this is a pset, not an executable task;  it defines a set of 
parameters used by other tasks.  Invoking the pset by name runs
'eparam' on the parameter set, allowing the user to modify the
parameters.  Alternatively, the parameters may be modified on the
command line by specifying the pset name and parameter name, for
example, you can type "pltpar.pointmode=yes" to set only the
'pointmode' parameter.  Parameters can also be edited by using
'eparam' on the calling task (e.g., by typing "eparam sgraph"), in 
which case, 'pltpar' will appear as one of the task parameters; the
'pltpar' parameters may then be edited by positioning the cursor on
the line containing the pset name and typing ":e".  After editing
the pset parameters, press Control-Z to return to the main task parameter menu.

PARAMETERS
.ls (stack = no) [boolean]
Stack multiple curves on separate vertical axes?  

If this is set to
"no", all curves will be scaled together and plotted on a single set of
axes.  Otherwise a separate set of axes will be drawn, joined into a
single vertical column.
.le
.ls (axis = 1) [integer, min = 1, max = 7]
Axis along which projection is to be taken.  If the input image has
more than one dimension, the data will be projected to a single
dimension.  This parameter specifies the axis along which projection
will occur.  The default is one, i.e., project along the X axis.
.le
.ls (pointmode = no) [boolean]
Plot points only?  

If set to "no", the task will plot connected curves.  Note that to
plot error bars, you must set 'pointmode = no' and 'erraxis = 1' or 'erraxis =
2'.  See the descriptions of  'marker' and 'szmarker'.
.le
.ls (marker = box) [string, allowed values: point | box | plus |
cross | circle | diamond | hline | vline | hebar | vebar]

The marker style for each plotted point if 'pointmode=yes'.  See also
'szmarker'.
.le
.ls (szmarker = 0.005) [real]
The size of the markers if 'pointmode = yes'.  If 'szmarker > 0', use
this value as the size in normalized device coordinates (NDC) .  If
'szmarker < 0', use the absolute value as the size in world coordinates
(WCS).  If 'szmarker = 0' and the input comes from a text file, use the
third column in the input data as the marker size.  If data are from an
image or a table, then 'szmarker' specifies the same size of every point.
.le
.ls (erraxis = 0) [integer, min = 0, max = 2]
Plot the data as error bars?  If 'erraxis = 0', plot the data as values
rather than error bars;  if 'erraxis = 1', plot the data as errors
parallel to the X axis; if 'erraxis =2', plot the data as errors
parallel to the Y axis.  Note that the value of 'erraxis' is ignored if
'pointmode = yes' and error bars will not be drawn.
.le
.ls (errtype = bartck) [string, allowed values: tckbar | bar | tick |
limit]

The style of error bars (if 'erraxis' is not zero).
.le
.ls (pattern = solid) [string, allowed values: solid | dashed | 
dotted | dotdash]

The line pattern style for the curve or the first of multiple curves.
.le
.ls (crvstyle = straight) [string, allowed values: straight | pseudohist 
| fullhist]

The curve style.  'straight' means line segments will connect data
points, 'pseudohist' means that horizontal segments will be placed at
each value and vertical segments will connect these, 'fullhist' means a
bar graph, or horizontal segments at each value with vertical lines
connecting the value with the bottom axis.
.le
.ls (rejectlog = yes) [boolean]
Replace invalid logarithmic values with 'INDEF'?  

Invalid values will
be ignored in scaling and plotting.
.le
.ls (box = yes) [boolean]
Draw the box containing the axes and labels around the edge of the
window?
.le
.ls (sysid = yes) [boolean]
Include standard system information in the plot title?  

If the 'sysid'
parameter is "yes", then a string including the user's name, date, host
name, etc. is included in the plot title.
.le
.sp
.ls (barpat ="hollow") [string, allowed values: hollow, solid, ahatch,
bhatch, chatch, dhatch]

Fill pattern for bar plot.  The nature of the pattern depends on the
device and graphics kernel (driver) used to plot.  Many kernels do not
support fill patterns.
.le
.sp
.ls (crvcolor = INDEF) [integer, min = 1]
Color index of data curve(s).  This color applies only to plotted data
curves.  The color of any axes, labels, etc., is specified by
the `color' parameter.  Note that the actual, drawn color will depend
on the device and graphics kernel (driver) used to plot.  Many kernels
do not support color at all.  The usual interpretation of the color
index is:
.nf

    1 -- Black
    2 -- White
    3 -- Red
    4 -- Green
    5 -- Blue
    6 -- Yellow
    7 -- Cyan (blue/green)
    8 -- Magenta (red/blue)
.fi
.le
.ls (color = INDEF) [integer, min = 1]
Color index of axis and labels.  The color of the data curve(s) is
specified by the `crvcolor' parameter.  Note that the actual, drawn
color will depend on the device and graphics kernel (driver) used to
plot.  Most kernels do not support color.
.le
.ls (cycolor = no) [boolean]
Cycle colors instead of line style for multiple curves?  

If multiple curves are plotted on the same viewport (axes), i.e.,
'stack=no', then use the color specified by the 'crvcolor' parameter
for the first curve, and the next available color for each subsequent
curve.  There are eight available colors, as described in the
description of the 'crvcolor' parameter.
.le
.sp
.ls (version = 17August92) [string]
Date that the task was installed.  This parameter should not be changed by
the user.
