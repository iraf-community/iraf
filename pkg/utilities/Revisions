    Renamed files, added help page for BASES task. (10/24/11)


=======
V2.12.2
=======

utilities$urand.x
    Modified method based on clktime for generating a new seed when
    the users specifies it as INDEF so that it doesn't have a 1 second
    granularity.  (8/7/03, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

utilities$mkpkg
    Added missing dependencies.  (10/11/99, Valdes)

utilities$curfit.gx
utilities$curfit.x
    Removed an unneccessay include file statmenet. (9/22/99, Davis)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

utilities$surfit.par
utilities$t_surfit.x
utilities$doc/surfit.hlp
    Added support for the half cross-terms option to the surfit task. This
    involved changing the type of the xterms parameter from boolen (yes/no)
    to string (none,half,full) but involved no other interface changes.
    (7/6/99, Davis)

utilities$doc/surfit.hlp
    Fixed minor formating problem.  (4/22/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.1
=======

utilities$urand.x
utilities$doc/urand.hlp
    If the "seed" parameter is set to INDEF then the clock time (integer
    seconds since 1980) will be used as the seed.  This allows different
    executions to produce different random numbers.
    (9/23/97, Valdes)

===========
V2.11export
===========

utilities$curfit.gx
    Removed repeated output and added a comment character to the table
    header line.  (2/29/95, Valdes)

utilities$t_polyfit.x
    Revoved the dependent variable normalization which was not doing anything
    to improve the numerical statbility of the routine and which was causing
    problems in the computation of the reduced chi-squared and standard
    deviation statistics.
    (7/11/94 LED)

utilities$t_polyfit.x
utilities$pfregres.f
    Added a trap for rmul values < 0.0 and > 1.0 to the polyfit routine
    to avoid floating operand errors caused by trying to take the square
    route of a negative number.
    (6/20/94 LED)

utilities$curfit.gx
    Removed the graph limit setting so that the graph will be automatically
    drawn with the default buffer distance from the end of the data.
    Previously the end datapoints would fall right on the axes.
    (5/10/94, Valdes)

utilities$utilities.cl
utilities$utilities.men
utilities$utilities.hd
    A task for fitting a 2D function or "surface" to an irregularly
    sampled set of x, y, and z points has been added.  (7/6/93, Valdes)

utilities$curfit/t_curfit.x,curfit.gx
    Curfit was failing if the input file list contained more than one
    file or image. The problem was that ic_open was being called
    before the file loop but ic_close(rd) was being called after every
    fit leaving a null pointer in place for the second file.
    (7/30/90 LED)

utilities$doc/polyfit.hlp
    Added the missing "statistical" heading under the weighting section.
    (7/23/90 LED)
    
utilities$lcase.x
    Changed the default output file name extension from ".uc" to ".lc".
    (3/7/90 LED)

utilities$t_curfit.x
    For list input only, curfit now sorts the input array before fitting.
    Sorted data is required by the rg_ranges procedure (even in the
    default case of sample=*) or else data points will be ommitted from
    the fit.  (24/6/88 ShJ)

utilities$t_curfit.x,curfit.gx
    Davis, December 2, 1987
    1. Added a new parameter weighting to the curfit task. The four weighting
    options are uniform, user, statistical and instrumental. The weights in
    the four cases are 1.0, user input, 1/y and 1/sigmay ** 2. In the latter
    case the weight that the user supplies is interpreted as sigmay. All
    four options are available if input is from a list or STDIN. If input
    is from an image section only the uniform and statistical options are
    available.

utilities$t_polyfit.x
    Davis, November 23, 1987.
    1. Added a new parameter weighting to the polyfit task. The three
    weighting options are instrumental, uniform and statistical. The
    weights in the three cases are 1./sigy ** 2, 1.0 and 1/y consistent
    with the Bevington definitions. If the weighting is instrumental
    the user must supply the error in y as well as x and y.

    Valdes, February 17, 1987
    1.  Required GIO changes.

utilities$t_curfit.x, curfit.gx:  Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Modified CURFIT to use new ICFIT package.

________________________________________

From:  Valdes	Mar 14, 1986
Task:  Curfit

1.  The CURFIT task has been modified to allow switching between single
and double precision calculations.  Generally double precision is used
but this task provides a convenient test facility for testing changes
in the mathematical routines or which precision is appropriate for a
new task being developed.

2.  The help page was updated.

________________________________________

From:  Hammond	Jan 6, 1986
Task:  Curfit

1. A new task, Curfit, has been installed.  It is the cl interface to
   the curfit package and allows for interactive fitting of functions
   to list or image data.  The function types supported are Legendre
   or Chebyshev polynomials and linear or cubic splines.

__________________________________________

From:	Hammond	Dec 19, 1985
Task:	Polyfit

1.  Polyfit no longer gets a floating divide by zero when a linear fit
    has a correlation = 1.  The problem was in the error calculation (ftest)
    portion of the Bevington routine regres.  This problem was reported
    by ST.
