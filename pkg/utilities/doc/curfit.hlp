NAME
curfit -- fit a curve to a list or an image section
.ih
USAGE
curfit input 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The data to be fit.  May be an image section, STDIN or a list of file names.
.le
.ls function = legendre
The type of function with which to fit the data.  Choices are 
legendre, chebyshev, spline1 (linear spline) or spline3 (cubic spline).
.le
.ls order = 4
The order of the fit or number of spline pieces. 
.le
.ls weighting = uniform
The type of weighting for the fit. The options are:
.ls uniform
The weight w = 1.0.  This option may be used for both list input and image
input.
.le
.ls user
The weights are supplied by the user. This option may be used for list input
only.
.le
.ls statistical
The weight w = 1.0 / y. This option can be used for both list and image data.
.le
.ls instrumental
The user supplies the sigmay for each point and w = 1.0 / sigmay ** 2.
This option may be used for list input only.
.le
.le
.ls interactive = yes
If \fBinteractive\fR is set to yes, a plot of the fit is drawn and the
cursor is available for interactively examining and adjusting the fit.
.le
.ls axis = 1
If \fBinput\fR names an image or image section, this parameter specifies
the axis along which the image is projected for fitting.
.le
.ls listdata = no
If \fBlistdata\fR is set to yes, the only printed output will be the calculated 
values for the X,Y pairs. This is useful as input to \fIgraph\fR or some
other list oriented program.
.le
.ls verbose = no
If \fBverbose\fR is set to yes, the fitted (X,Y) pairs are listed in addition 
to the default output of filename, function type, order, rejection parameters, 
coefficients and their errors.
.le
.ls power = no
If \fBpower\fR is set to yes, the coefficients of the legendre or
chebyshev polynomials will be converted to power series coefficients.
.le
.ls calctype = "double"
Calculation datatype.  The two datatypes are "real" (single precision) and
"double" (double precision).
.le
.ls device = "stdgraph"
The output device for interactive graphics.
.le
.ls cursor = "stdgcur"
The source of graphics cursor input.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A curve is fit to data read from either an image section or a list.
The type of curve is set by the \fBfunction\fR parameter as either
a legendre polynomial, chebyshev polynomial, linear spline or cubic
spline, with the order of the fit (or number of spline pieces) set by
\fBorder\fR.  If data is read from an image, the \fBaxis\fR parameter
is used to reduce the dimensionality of the image; it specifies the
axis along which the image is projected.  For example, when \fBaxis\fR
= 1, the image is compressed to a column.  \fBAxis\fR = 2 would project
the image along a line; \fBaxis\fR = 3 indicates projection in the z
direction, etc.

The input data must be ordered in x because of a restriction in the
interactive plotting package.  If the input is from a list, the data
are sorted prior to fitting; image input data are assumed to be ordered
in x and are not explicitly sorted by \fIcurfit\fR.

If the input is from a list the user may specify a set of weights,
\fBweighting\fR = user or a set of errors, \fBweighting\fR =
instrumental. An additional weighting option \fBweighting\fR = statistical
can be used for both list and image data. The default is \fBweighting\fR =
uniform.

When \fBinteractive\fR = yes, the curve is plotted and cursor commands allow
for interactive examining and adjustment of the fit. 
The full range of interactive cursor commands is available
including those for changing the function type, order, and rejection criteria,
and examining the residuals.

The final fit parameters are written to STDOUT with the
format controlled by parameters \fBverbose\fR and \fBlistdata\fR.
By default, the function type, order, and resulting chi-square are 
printed as well as the coefficients and their standard deviations.  
If \fBverbose\fR is set to yes, a list of X, Y_calculated, Y_input,
and W_input is also printed.
If \fBlistdata\fR is set to yes, the only printed output will
be a listing of X, Yc, Y and W. This provides a list suitable as input to
\fBgraph\fR or any other list oriented utility.  Setting \fBlistdata\fR 
to yes overrides the verbose option.

When \fBpower\fR = yes, the coefficients are converted to power series
coefficients of the form a0 + a1*X + a2*X**2 +a3*X**3 ....
Only legendre and chebyshev coefficients are converted; a conversion
of spline coefficients is meaningless.  Also, errors in the coefficients
are not converted.

The user has a choice of single or double precision calculations.  Generally
double precisions is used since the calculation time is only slightly
longer.  The single precision calculation is used in many other tasks
which do many fits.  This task provides a test tool to compare the
results between the two levels of precision.

EXAMPLES

1.  The x,y pairs in file test.data are interactively fit with a fourth 
order legendre polynomial.  The printed output is shown.

.nf
	cl> curfit test.data 
	NOAO/IRAF V2.0 Hammond@lyra Fri 11:45:41 13-Dec-85
	file = test.data
	function = legendre
	grow = 0.
	naverage = 1
	order = 4
	low_reject = 0., high_reject = 0.
	niterate = 1
	sample = *
	total points = 8
	sample points = 8
	nrejected = 0
	deleted = 0
	square root of reduced chi square = 3.008706E-6
		coefficient	  error
 	1	   2.633E1	  1.098E-6
 	2	   3.150E1	  1.820E-6
 	3	   8.167E0	  1.896E-6
 	4	 -1.621E-6	  2.117E-6
.fi

2.  Fit a cubic spline to the last 12 columns of image "m74".

.nf
   cl> curfit m74[501:512,1:512] axis=2 func=spline3 order=5
.fi

3. Use \fIcurfit\fR as a filter to overplot a smoothed curve to an existing
plot of the data points.  The command line for \fBgraph\fR is shown as
well as the \fBcurfit\fR command.  Note the interactive flag for 
\fBcurfit\fR is turned off.

.nf
   cl> graph points.list point+ mark=box wx1=.13 xlab="X VALUES"\
   >>> ylab="Y VALUES" title="Legendre fit to points.list"
   cl> type points.list | curfit list+ inter- | graph append+
