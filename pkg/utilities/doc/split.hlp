NAME
split -- split a large file into smaller segments
.ih
USAGE
split input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The name of the input file (only a single file can be processed).
.le
.ls output
The root name of the output files.
.le
.ls nlines = 1000
The maximum number of lines per output segment file, if the input file
is a text file.
.le
.ls nbytes = 16384
The maximum number of bytes per output segment file, if the input file
is a binary file.
.le
.ls maxfiles = 999
Maximum number of output files.  Used to determine the amount of zero
padding needed for the filename extensions.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print the name and size of each output file as it is generated.

DESCRIPTION
The \fIsplit\fR task is used to break large files up into smaller segments,
e.g., when it is necessary to deal with an unmanageably large file.
Lacking any knowledge of the file structure, the segments are broken on
arbitrarily located but equally spaced boundaries.  The segments may
subsequently be reassembled into larger segments of the original file with
\fIconcatenate\fR or \fIcopy\fR (with output redirection), or \fIsplit\fR may
be applied again to break a large segment up into smaller segments without
losing any information.

EXAMPLES
1. Split a large text file into segments, each of which is the default size.

	cl> split textfile seg

2. Split a large \fItar\fR format archive file (10240 byte records) up into
a series of smaller files, each of which contains 10 records from the input
tar file.

	cl> split big.arc seg nb=(10240*10)
