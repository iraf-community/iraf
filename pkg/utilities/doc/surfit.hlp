NAME
surfit -- fit a surface, z=f(x,y), to a set of x, y, z points
.ih
USAGE
surfit input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Input text file containing the data to be fit.  The file consists of lines
with three or four whitespace separated values giving x, y, z, and
optionally a weight.
.le
.ls image = ""
Optional image name in which to create an evenly sampled image of the
fitted surface.  If no name is specified a image is not created.  If an
image name is specified then the x range in the input is evenly divided by
the specified number of image columns, the y range is evenly divided by the
specified number of lines, and the fitted surface values evaluated at the
sampled x and y points are written as the pixel values of the image.  A
linear world coordinate system based on the x and y values is also created
for the image.
.le
.ls coordinates = "", fit = ""
The first two columns of the text file specified by the coordinates parameter
are use to supply x and y values which are evaluated by the surface and
the resulting x, y, and z values are appended to the specified fit file.
If either parameter is not specified then this surface evaluation is
not done.  Note that the input data points are evaluated as part of
the standard output but one may, if desired, specify the input file
as the coordinate file to create a separate output.
.le

.ls function = "polynomial" (chebyshev|legendre|polynomial)
Surface function type to fit.  The choices are a chebyshev, legendre,
or simple power series bi-dimensional polynomial.
.le
.ls xorder = 2, yorder = 2
The polynomial orders in x and y.
.le
.ls xterms = "full"
The options are:
.ls none
The individual polynomial terms contain powers of x or powers of y but not
powers of both.
.le
.ls half
The individual polynomial terms contain powers of x and powers of y, whose
maximum combined power is max (xorder - 1, yorder - 1).
.le
.ls full
The individual polynomial terms contain powers of x and powers of y, whose
maximum combined power is max (xorder - 1 + yorder - 1).
.le
.le
.ls weighting = "user" (uniform|user|statistical|instrumental)
The type of weighting for the fit. The options are:
.ls uniform
All weights are 1.  Any input weights are ignored.
.le
.ls user
The weights in the fourth input column are used.  If no weight is given
a weight of 1 is supplied.
.le
.ls statistical
The reciprocal of the absolute value of z input data is used as the weight.
Any input weights are ignored.  Z values less than 1e-20 are set to 1e-20.
.le
.ls instrumental
The fourth input column is taken as a sigma and the weight is the
reciprocal of the sigma squared.  If no sigma is given a sigma of
1 is supplied.  Sigma values less than 1e-10 are set to 1e-10.
.le
.le
.ls xmin = INDEF, xmax = INDEF, ymin = INDEF, ymax = INDEF
These parameters define the range of input x and y data to be used and
also define the range over which the surface function is defined.  If
INDEF then the appropriate limit from the input data points is used.
If input data points lie outside these limits they are discarded.  The
range may be given larger than the range of the input data in order
to all evaluating coordinates outside input data; i.e. to
allow extrapolation.
.le
.ls zmin = INDEF, zmax = INDEF
These parameters apply threshold limits to the input data.  If INDEF
the appropriate limit from the input data points is used.  Input
data points with z values outside this range are discarded.
.le
.ls ncols = 100, nlines = 100
The number of columns and lines for the optional surface image.  These
parameters determine the size of the image and how finely the x and
y input data range is subdivided.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This task fits a surface, a function of two coordinates, to a set of
possibly irregularly sampled data points specified in a text file.
The input consists of a file with three or four columns.  The first
two columns define the two coordinates, called x and y, the third
column gives the value the function is supposed to fit, called z,
and the optional fourth column is a weight or sigma.  If a weight or
sigma is not specified it will have a unit weight or sigma.  The type
of weighting is selected by a task parameter.

The input data points may be restricted by use of the \fIxmin, xmax,
ymin, ymax, zmin, zmax\fR parameters.  If these parameters are INDEF
(the default) the full range of the input is used.  The surface function
is only defined within the specified x and y range.  In order to
extrapolate outside the range of the input data these limits must
be specified explicitly.

The functions which may be fit are legendre, chebyshev, or simple
power series bi-dimensional polynomials.  The user selects the
function type, the order in x and y, and whether to include
cross terms.  The orders are the number of coefficients which
is the highest polynomial power plus 1.  For example the default
values of 2 in each coordinate define a linear sloped plane.
All computations are done in double precision.

Several polynomial cross terms options are available. Options "none",
"half", and "full" are illustrated below for a quadratic polynomial in
x and y.

.nf
xterms = "none"
xorder = 3, yorder = 3

   z = a11 + a21 * x + a12 * y + a31 * x ** 2 + a13 * y ** 2

xterms = "half"
xorder = 3, yorder = 3

   z = a11 + a21 * x + a12 * y + a31 * x ** 2 + a22 * x * y + a13 * y ** 2

xterms = "full"
xorder = 3, yorder = 3

   z = a11 + a21 * x + a31 * x ** 2 +
         a12 * y + a22 * x * y +  a32 * x ** 2 * y +
         a13 * y ** 2 + a23 * x *  y ** 2 +
         a33 * x ** 2 * y ** 2
.fi

The fit results are written to the standard output; the terminal unless
redirected.  It consists of the input parameters, the coefficients and
errors, and the input data plus the fitted values and residuals.  The
coefficient lines contain four columns.  The first two columns are the x
and y polynomial powers and then the coefficient and error in the
coefficient are given.  The coefficients are determined based on a
normalized coordinate; the range of input x and y values, which is shown in
the output as xmin, xmax, ymin, and ymax, is mapped to the range -1 to 1.
The data portion gives the x, y, and z input values followed by the fitted
value and the residual (z - fit) and finally the weight.

There are two types of additional output which may be selected if desired.
One is a two dimensional image of the surface evenly sampled over the x and
y data range set by the xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax parameters.  This type of
output is selected by specifying an image name and the number of columns
and lines.  The number of columns and lines defines the size of the image
and also the sampling of the x and y values.  The first pixel in each
dimension is the minimum x or y value and the sample interval per pixel is
given by:

.nf
	dx = (xmax - xmin) / (ncols - 1)
	dy = (ymax - ymin) / (nlines - 1)
.fi

The fitted surface is evaluated at each pixel and written to the image.
The linear world coordinate system defining the x and y pixel sampling is
written to the image header.  This allows tasks such as \fBimplot\fR and
\fBlistpixels\fR to show the fitted values in the input x and y units.

The second type of output allows the surface to be evaluated at an
arbitrary set of x and y coordinates.  The coordinates are input
as a text file.  The first two columns are taken as the x and y values
and any other columns are ignored.  The x and y values and the fitted
values are appended to a specified text file.  This output is
optional and only occurs if both an input coordinate and output
fit file are specified.  Note that the input data points are
always evaluated as part of the standard output but the input
data file may also be used as a coordinate file if desired.
Also the output data file may be specified as "STDOUT" to merge
this output with the basic results output.
