NAME
urand -- uniform random number generator
.ih
USAGE
urand nlines ncols
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls nlines
The number of lines of output to be generated.
.le
.ls ncols
The number of random numbers per output line.
.le
.ls ndigits = 4
Number of digits of precision in each random number.
.le
.ls scale_factor = 1.0
Factor by which the numbers are to be scaled (multiplied).
.le
.ls seed = 1
Seed for the random number generator.  If the value is "INDEF" then
the clock time (integer seconds since 1980) is used as the seed
value giving different random numbers for different executions.

DESCRIPTION
The system random number generator is called to generate a sequence of
random numbers in list form.  By default, the random numbers will
be uniformly distributed over the range 0 to 1.  The number of lines
of output, number of columns (random numbers) per line, and number of
significant digits in each number may all be set by the caller.
.ih
EXAMPLES
Generate a sequence of 100 random numbers and graph them on the graphics
terminal in point plot mode.  Autoscaling is turned off so that the plot
will be scaled to the rand 0-1 (the \fBgraph\fR defaults) in both axes.
