NAME
mkttydata -- build a cache for graphcap/termcap device entries
.ih
USAGE
mkttydata devices termcap_file output_file
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls devlist
A comma delimited list of the devices whose termcap or graphcap entries
are to be compiled.
.le
.ls termcap_file
The name of the termcap or graphcap file be searched, e.g., "dev$termcap",
or "dev$graphcap".
.le
.ls output_file
The name of the output file to be written, an SPP include file containing
a number of declarations and data initialization statements.
This should be "dev$cachet.dat" if the standard termcap is being compiled,
and "dev$cacheg.dat" if the standard graphcap is being compiled.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Causes a message to be printed for each device entry compiled.

DESCRIPTION
The \fImkttydata\fR task is used by the IRAF system manager to precompile
the \fItermcap\fR or \fIgraphcap\fR entries for commonly used video or
graphics terminals.  This can be advantageous on slow systems since otherwise
the termcap or graphcap file must be searched at runtime every time the
screen is cleared or a graph is plotted, reducing the performance and
interactive response of the system.  Since each IRAF site will commonly use
a different set of devices, entries can only be cached by the local system
manager after the system is installed.  [NOTE, Jun 1990: the above is
still true, but with the addition of features such as shared libraries and
multiple architecture support to some versions of IRAF, relinking IRAF is
more difficult and it is easier to make mistakes.  Furthermore, modern
systems are getting very fast.  For most sites it will be easier, and safer,
to merely copy frequently referenced device entries to the head of the
termcap or graphcap file and skip the sysgen.]

The input to \fImkttydata\fR consists of a list of devices and a reference
to either the termcap or graphcap file.  The output is an SPP include file
which is referenced by the procedures in the TTY package.  After updating
the cache files, a full system sysgen is required to recompile the affected
modules, update them in the system libraries, and relink all executables.

Enter the following values for the \fItermcap_file\fR and \fIoutput_file\fR
parameters to build the termcap and graphcap cache files.  Note that for
caching to work the value of \fItermcap_file\fR must match that of
the \fItermcap\fR or \fIgraphcap\fR environment variable, hence do not
enter "graphcap" rather than "dev$graphcap", just because you happen to
be in the dev directory.

.ks
.nf
			\fItermcap_file\fR	\fIoutput_file\fR
	
	termcap		dev$termcap	dev$cachet.dat
	graphcap	dev$graphcap	dev$cacheg.dat
.fi
.ke

After updating these files, perform a sysgen-relink to update the
system libraries and relink all executables (this takes a while, and
requires IRAF permissions and full sources).  Instructions for performing
the sysgen-relink are given in the \fISite Manager's Guide\fR for your
IRAF system.  The exact procedure for performing a sysgen-relink depends
upon the host system.  In particular, if the system support multiple
architectures, each architecture must be restored and relinked separately.
Note that systems configured for multiple architecture support are
shipped configured "generic", and you must restore an architecture before
relinking or the entire IRAF system will be recompiled (which is time
consuming, and inadvisable due to the possibility of system or compiler
differences introducing bugs into IRAF).

After this finishes, log out and back in and you should notice the
difference when running tasks like \fIpage\fR, \fIclear\fR, and \fIimplot\fR.

Note that once a device entry is cached it cannot be modified without
going through this all over again, while if the entry is not cached it
can be edited and the new entry used immediately.  It is therefore not
desirable to cache new termcap or graphcap entries until they have stopped
changing.  Even after a device entry has been cached, however, it is possible
to test new entries by changing the entry name, or by changing the value
of the \fItermcap\fR or \fIgraphcap\fR environment variable.  If these
values are different than they were when the entries were cached, the cached
entries will not be used, even if the device name matches that of a cached
entry.

For additional information on graphcap see the "GIO Design" document.
For additional information on termcap see the Berkeley UNIX "Programmer's
Guide: Reference Manual", section 5.  IRAF uses a standard UNIX termcap.

EXAMPLES
1. Update the graphcap cache.

.nf
    cl> mktty vt640,vt240,4012,cit414a dev$graphcap dev$cacheg.dat
.fi

.ih
BUGS
There is a fixed limit on the amount of data that can be cached.
If the limit is exceedd the affected TTY modules will fail to compile.
