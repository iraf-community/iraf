NAME
tokens -- break input into stream of tokens
.ih
USAGE
tokens files
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls files
The list of files to be converted into a stream of tokens.
.le
.ls ignore_comments = yes
Ignore comments in the input string?
.le
.ls begin_comment = "#"
The string marking the start of a comment
.le
.ls end_comment = "eol"
The string marking the end of a comment.  The value \fBend_comment\fR = "eol"
means the end of a line terminates a comment.
.le
.ls newlines = yes
Is newline a legal token?
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Task \fItokens\fR breaks the input up into a series of tokens.
The makeup of the
various tokens is defined by the FMTIO primitive ctotok, which is not very 
sophisticated, and does not claim to recognize the tokens for any particular
language (though it does reasonably well for most modern languages).  Comments
can be deleted if desired, and newlines may be passed on to the output as
tokens.

Comments are delimited by user specified strings.  Only strings which are also
recognized by ctotok() as legal tokens may be used as comment delimiters.
If newline marks the end of a comment, the end_comment string should be given
as "eol".  Examples of acceptable comment conventions are ("#", eol),
("/*", "*/"), ("{", "}"), and ("!", eol).  Fortran style comments ("^{c}",eol)
can be stripped by filtering with match beforehand.

Each token is passed to the output on a separate line.  Multiple newline
tokens are compressed to a single token (a blank line).  If newline is not
desired as an output token, it is considered whitespace and serves only to
delimit tokens.
