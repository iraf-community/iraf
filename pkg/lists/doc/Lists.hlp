Basic IRAF System Utilities

    A number of standard utilities are available as part of the IRAF
user interface.  These utilities, most of which operate on files, are
summarized later in this document.  A general discussion of files in
the IRAF system follows.  The reader is assumed to have some familiarity
with the IRAF command language (CL).

.sh
Virtual File Names

    File names may be specified in a machine independent fashion, or with
OS dependent pathnames.  A Virtual File Name (VFN) has the following form:

.nf
	ldir$root.extn

where

	ldir		logical directory or device name
	root		root or base file name
	extn		extension denoting the type of file
.fi

The LDIR and EXTN fields are optional.  The ROOT and EXTN fields may contain
up to 20 characters selected from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_.+-#].  The EXTN field
may not exceed three characters.  The EXTN field is separated from the ROOT
by the character "." (dot).  If the ROOT field contains one or more occurrences
of the dot character, the final dot delimited field is understood to be
the extension.

Logical directories are defined in the CL, using the SET command to associate
an OS dependent pathname with a keyword in the environment table.  Logical
directory prefixes are recursively expanded.

A number of standard logical directories and devices are defined by the CL
at startup time.  Additional logical directories are defined by applications
packages upon entry, and become undefined when dictionary space is reclaimed
on exit from the package.  The user may override environment definitions at
will, by issuing SET commands to redefine environment variables.

.sh
File List Templates

    Whenever it makes sense, the IRAF utilities are set up to process a list
of files, rather than a single file.  In the descriptions of the standard
utilities in the next section, "files" is a template or pattern specifying
a list of files to be processed in some way.  The template is a string type
parameter to the CL, which is expanded by a procedure (CLGFIL) in the
compiled systems or applications task into an EOF terminated list of files.

A template may consist of one or more file names, directory names,
list file names, or patterns.  List elements are delimited by commas.
A list file is denoted by prepending the character "@" to the pathname
of the list file.  A pattern may be applied to the contents of either
a list file or a directory.  The pattern is separated from the list file
or directory name by the character "$".  A pattern all by itself is
applied to the current directory.  Either logical or OS dependent
pathnames may be used.

A list element may refer only to a single directory.  Thus, one cannot
specify a pattern such as "*/*.x", as is possible in UNIX.

Some examples of templates follow:

.nf
	file
	"file1, file2"
	"*.x"
	"[A-Z]*, *.com, ../$, ../fio/$*.x, lib$*.h, file, @list$*.vs"
	"sia1:[iraf.lib]$*.h, uparm$cl_*.par"
.fi

The magic filenames "STDIN", "STDOUT", and "STDERR" have a special
meaning.  Passing one of these special filenames to a task causes
the named stream to be "reopened", transparently to the applications
program.  Thus, for example, one can reference "STDIN" in a template,
and the applications program will read from the standard input when
it opens the corresponding file in the template.

For example,

.nf
	cl> concat "file1, @STDIN, STDIN, file2", > ofile
.fi

concatenates the file "file1", the contents of the files named in the
standard input (until the first EOF), the contents of the standard input
itself (until the second EOF), and the contents of the file "file2",
placing the output in the file "ofile".

.sh
File Protection and Clobber

    The IRAF file interface (FIO) provides file protection and synchronization
facilities, under control of user definable environment variables.

File "clobber" refers to the overwriting of an existing file when a new
file of the same name is created as an output file.  If "clobber" is
defined as "no" in the environment, an IRAF task will abort if a new file
would clobber an existing file.  If file clobber is enabled, FIO will try
to overwrite the old file, and will abort if it cannot do so.

.nf
	cl> set clobber = "yes"
.fi

More explicit file protection is provided by the CL commands PROTECT and
UNPROTECT.  A protected file cannot be deleted, accidentally or otherwise,
until the protection has been removed with the UNPROTECT command or system
call.

A final form of file protection is provided to prevent a file from being
clobbered which is already open by a task.  Thus, "COPY file,file" will
abort when FIO discovers that "file" is already opened for reading.  This
holds even if file clobber is enabled.

.sh
File Synchronization

    File synchronization is useful when a process requires exclusive access
to a file which is already open for exclusive access by another process.  
When this situation occurs, the second task may abort with a message stating
that it cannot access the file, or the task may wait for the file to become
available.  File waiting is especially important for batch processes.

.nf
	cl> set file_wait = "yes"
.fi

The file wait option is controlled by the "file_wait" variable in the
environment.  If file waiting is enabled, and a process finds that it
has to wait to access a file, a warning message will be printed on the
standard error output before the affected process goes to sleep.

.sh
Description of the Standard Utility Routines

    Most of the system utilities are set up to read from either the
standard input or a list of files.  If not reading from the standard
input, and the input file template is not given on the command line,
a prompt will be issued for the input file list.  If the output is a
single file or directory, and output is not redirected, a prompt will
be issued for the output file.

The following list of system utilities is expected to adequately meet
the needs of both general users and programmers.  Most notably missing
are file editing facilities and the X-compiler.  These will be added
to the system utilities package at some point in the future.  Other more
specialized utilities and tools, such as are needed for general image
processing, graphics, database management, magtape i/o, and so on, will
be provided in the form of new packages in the months to come.

.ks
.ls 4 ALLOCATE device

Allocate a device (e.g., a tape drive).  The standard logical tape
drive names will probably be "mt0" and "mt1".
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls CLEAR

.le
.ke

.ks
.ls COLUMNS [files] [, c = "1,3,5-8"]

Breaks the named file or files (or the standard input) up into a stream
of words, written one word per line on the standard output.  A "word"
is any whitespace delimited sequence of characters, or a quoted string.

The hidden parameter COLUMNS may be used to extract only a particular column,
or any list of columns, from each line.  If the list contains only the
element "0" (the default) all columns are extracted, and placed on separate
output lines.  If multiple columns are specified, only those columns given
in the list are extracted, and all extracted columns from an input line
appear together on a single output line.  If the last element in the list
is "0", all remaining columns in the input line are extracted and placed
on the output line.

.ls HELP [task(s)]

Retrieve documentation for the named task(s) from the help database,
and format it on the standard output.  If no task name is given, the
tasks comprising the current package are summarized, one line per task
(task name followed by a brief description).  Help may be obtained for
multiple tasks by supplying a template.  Tasks not in the current
package search path may be referenced by specifying the pathname to
the task ("package.task").

Print "manual pages" for each of the named tasks.  Manual pages are
produced by breaking the help text for a task up into successive
pages delimited by formfeed characters.  Each page has a header and
a page number.  To print manual pages, the output of MANPAGE should
be piped to PRINT ("manpage task(s) | print").

.ls PRINT [files]

The named files (or the standard output) are printed on the standard
line printer device.  If a list of files are to be printed, each
file is printed started on a new page, and file pages are broken and
printed with numbered headers.  If PRINT is reading from its standard
input, the input stream is copied to the printer without pagination.

The input stream may contain ASCII standard control characters (e.g.
formfeed), which will be processed if necessary prior to transmission
to the output device.

.nf
hidden params:
    page		yes/no	[no]	paginate the standard input
    nlpp		int	[60]	number of lines per page
    szline		int	[132]	maximum line length
    device		string		name of printer device
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls PROTECT [files]

Protect the named files from deletion or clobber, accidental or
otherwise.  It is not considered an error to attempt to protect
a file which is already protected.  Protecting a file only prevents
deletion of the file: write permission is not withdrawn.
