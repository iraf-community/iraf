NAME
rgcursor -- read the graphics cursor (makes a list)
.ih
USAGE
gcursor
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Task \fIrgcursor\fR iteratively reads the graphics cursor, writing the
cursor values to the standard output.  The standard output is normally
redirected into a text file to generate a coordinate list to be used as
input to one or more other programs.  Any IRAF program which reads the
graphics cursor may be run taking input from a list prepared in advance
with \fIrgcursor\fR (as well as interactively, of course).

A plot should be drawn on the graphics terminal before running \fIrgcursor\fR.
When the program is run a loop is entered, reading the global graphics
cursor until the end of file character (e.g., <ctrl/z>, <ctrl/d>) is typed.
Each cursor read causes a line to be printed on the standard output, after
which the cursor is again read.

While the program is waiting for the cursor to be read, i.e., whenever
the cursor crosshairs are displayed, the terminal is said to be in
"cursor mode".  While in cursor mode, various commands may be entered,
e.g., to zoom in a feature to get a more accurate cursor position, without
terminating the current cursor read.  To read the cursor position, enter
any key not recognized as a cursor mode command, i.e., any lower case or
non-alphanumeric character.  The actual character one should type depends
upon the program for which the list is intended.  If the program will use
only the X and Y coordinates of the cursor any character may be typed,
e.g., tap the space bar.  If the program uses the key to determine what
action to take, then you must type a specific key.

The X and Y coordinates of the cursor position and other information
comprising the cursor value are printed on the standard output when the
cursor is read.  The cursor position may optionally be marked whenever the
cursor is read, by setting the ":.markcur" option when in cursor mode.
This is useful when preparing long lists to keep track of the objects
or features that have already been marked.

For additional information on \fIcursor mode\fR and the format of a cursor
value string, type "help cursor".  For information on the key and string values
required by the applications program for which the cursor list is intended,
consult the documentation for that program.

EXAMPLES
1. Interactively generate a starlist (file "starlist") to be used as input
to another program, e.g., for digital photometry.  In this case one would
probably want to start with a contour plot labeled in image pixel coordinates.

.nf
	cl> contour m74			# make the plot
	cl> rgcursor > starlist		# make the object list
.fi

At this point, the cursor loop is entered and the terminal is placed
into cursor mode.  Any of the following commands might be appropriate:

.nf
	\fBcommand\fR		\fBaction\fR

	:.markcur+	enables marking of the cursor position
			    when the cursor is read

	:radius 7	set object radius in pixels
	:annulus 10 15	set annulus radii to be used for sky
	space_bar	mark the position of an object
	space_bar	mark the position of an object
				(etc.)
	
	Z		zoom in on a feature to get a more
			    accurate cursor read
	space_bar	mark the position of the object
	space_bar	mark the position of another object
	0		replot the original plot
	
	<crtl/z>	(EOF) terminates rgcursor
.fi

Given the above command sequence, the output file "starlist" might
contain the following cursor values.

.nf
	234.435 78.9292 1 : radius 7
	234.475 78.9243 1 : annulus 10 15
	67.2822 282.319 1 \40
	766.252 344.224 1 \40
	822.918 311.748 1 \40
	76.8272 822.139 1 \40
