rimcursor.par
rimcursor.x
doc/rimcursor.hlp
	Added the parameters wxformat and wyformat to the rimcursor task.
	These default formats take precedence over the formats stored in the
	WCS in the image header and the default format for all values
	of the wcs parameter. (Davis 9/3/92)

columns.x
	The columns task has been reinstalled.  The default value of
	outroot was changed, source code cleaned up and manual page
	updated.  (ShJ 12-NOV-88)

Davis, October 5, 1988
        1. I replaced the data_value ** 2 and sum ** 2 constructs in the
        average script to get around a SUN problem with raising 0.0 to any
        power. This is probably good programming practice in any case.
