delete -- delete a file or files
.ih
USAGE
delete files
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls files
The list of files to be deleted.
.le
.ls verify = no
Check with the user before deleting a file.  If verify is enabled the file
name is printed and the user is queried before the default action is taken.
.le
.ls default_action = yes
This is the default action to take when operating in "verify" mode.
For example, if the default action is "yes", one need only type RETURN in
response to the verify prompt to delete the file.
.le
.ls allversions = yes
Delete all versions of a file.  This parameter has no effect on systems like
UNIX which do not support multiple file versions.
.le
.ls subfiles = yes
Delete subfiles.  Not currently used.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fIDelete\fR destroys a file or files and returns the space they occupied to
the host system, to be reused for other files.  Once a file has been deleted,
it is gone forever (unless a copy exists somewhere).  Enabling \fIverify\fR
gives one the opportunity to say yes or no before each file is deleted; this
is particularly useful when \fIfiles\fR is a template.  Note that
\fIprotect\fR can be used to protect files from deletion, accidental or
otherwise.  Imagefiles are automatically protected by the system to remind
the user to use \fIimdelete\fR to delete images (this is necessary because
an image is stored in more than one physical file).
.ih
EXAMPLES

1. Delete all files with extension ".x", verifying each file deletion before
it is performed.

.nf
	cl> delete *.x ver+
.fi

2. List all files in the current directory, deleting only those files for
which the user responds to the verify prompt with "yes" or "y".  Note that
"delete *" is a very dangerous operation.

.nf
	cl> delete * ver+ def=no
.fi
