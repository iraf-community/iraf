Description of the Standard Utility Routines

    Most of the system utilities are set up to read from either the
standard input or a list of files.  If not reading from the standard
input, and the input file template is not given on the command line,
a prompt will be issued for the input file list.  If the output is a
single file or directory, and output is not redirected, a prompt will
be issued for the output file.

.ks
.ls 4 ALLOCATE device

Allocate a device (i.e., a tape drive).  Some devices must be allocated
before they can be accessed for i/o.  Deallocation occurs automatically
upon logoff, or upon execution of DEALLOCATE.  The following devices may
be allocated:

.nf
Devices:
	mta	Magtape unit A.
	mtb	Magtape unit B.
	ima	Image display unit A.
	imb	Image display unit B.

.ks
.ls BEEP
Beep the terminal bell.  Used as in "> munch;beep" to signal when a
lengthy command has finished.  Otherwise, an IRAF program will only
ring the terminal bell when an error has occurred.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls CLEAR

Clear the terminal screen.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls CONCATENATE files [,output_file]

Concatenate the named input files to the standard output or to the named
output file if given.  All input files should be of the same type (text or
binary).  The default type of the output file is the same as that of the
first input file; this may be overridden by setting the hidden parameter
"out_type".  The standard input is assumed to be a text file unless overridden
by setting out_type.  If no output file is given on the command line, the
standard output is assumed.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    out_type	string = "in_type"	Output file type (text|binary)
    append	bool = no		Append to output file
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls COPY file|files, output_file|directory

Copy the input file to the output file, or copy each file in the input list
to the directory given as the second argument.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls COUNT files

Count the number of lines, words, and characters in each file
in the input list.  Print the totals for each file and for all files.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls DEALLOCATE device

Deallocate a previously allocated device (e.g., a tape drive).  Devices
are automatically deallocated upon logoff if not explicitly deallocated
with the deallocate command.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls DELETE files

Delete the named files.  A warning message is printed if a file
cannot be deleted.  It is not considered an error to attempt to
delete a file which does not exist.  Protected files cannot be
deleted without first removing their protection.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    verify	bool = no	Generate query to verify that each
				  file should indeed be deleted.
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls DEVSTATUS device

Print status information (i.e., is the device allocated, to whom, etc.)
for the named device.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls DIRECTORY [files] [,op=string]

Tabulate information on all files matching the template given as the
first argument on the standard output.  If no template is given, the
contents of the current directory are displayed.  The "long" format
gives file protection status, type (text, binary, directory, or executable),
access modes (owner, group, world), owner name, size in bytes, date of
last modify, and the file name.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    option	string = "m"	    1	one-column format
				    a	use time of last access
				    c	use time of creation
				    l	long format
				    m	multicolumn format (default)
				    s	add size in Kb
				    t	time sort
				    r	reverse sort

e.g.: > dir op=l	(show current directory, long form)
      > dir "*.x",op=lt	(all ".x" files in current directory, long form)
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls DISKSPACE

Summarize the amount of disk space available on the local system.
This command and its output are machine dependent.  This command
may not be available on all systems.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls HEAD files

Print the first few lines of each of the named files on the standard
output.  If more than one file is printed, a brief header is printed to
identify each file.

.nf
hidden params:
    nlines	int = 12	number of lines to print
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls LPRINT files

The named text files (or the standard input) are printed on the standard
line printer device.  If several files are to be printed, each file is
printed starting on a new page, and file pages are broken and printed
with numbered headers.  If reading from the standard input, the input
stream is copied to the printer without pagination, though pages may still
be broken by embedding formfeed characters in the text.  The map_cc
option may be used to turn off all control character mapping, if binary
data is to be sent to the printer.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    map_cc	bool = yes	Map control characters into a printable
				  sequence (^L, etc.)
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls MATCH pattern, files

Search each text file for the given pattern.  Copy a line to the standard
output if the pattern can be matched.  Match against the standard input
if no files are named.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    stop	bool = no	Stop matched lines and pass unmatched
				  lines to the output instead.
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls NEWS

Page through the system news file, starting with the most recent entries.
The system news file is a sort of electronic bulletin board, used to
post announcements and notes of general interest.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls PAGE files

The named text files (or the standard input) are displayed a page at a
time on the standard output.  If there is more than one input file,
a brief header is printed at the beginning of each file.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    map_cc	bool = yes	Map control characters into a printable
				  sequence (^L, etc.)
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls PROTECT files

Protect the named files from deletion or clobber, accidental or otherwise.
It is not considered an error to attempt to protect a file which is already
protected.  Protecting a file prevents only deletion or clobber of the entire
file: the contents of the file may still be overwritten.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls RENAME file|files, output_file|directory

Rename a file, or move each file in the input list to the directory
given as the second argument.
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls SORT files

Sort and/or merge the text files named in the list, or sort the standard
input if no list.  Sorting is by line or column, alphabetically or
numerically, in forward or reverse order.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    numeric_sort	bool = no	Sort numerically instead of
					  alphabetically, if datum is
					  a number.
    reverse_sort	bool = no	Reverse the sense of the sort.
    column		int = 0		If 0, sort the entire line, else
					  sort the indicated column.
    ignore_whitespace	bool = yes	Ignore leading whitespace if
					  sorting full lines.
    merge		bool = no	Merge the input files, which are
					  assumed to already have been
					  sorted.
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls SPY

Get information on who is using the system, what they are up to, how
much cpu time, etc., they have used, and so on.  This command, and the
information it gives, are machine dependent.  This command may not be
available on all systems.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    verbose	bool = no	Give more detailed information.
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls STTY [terminal]

Identify the type of terminal being used, if different than the system
default.  This is necessary to tell the system the control sequence to
be used to clear the screen, the dimensions of the screen, etc.  If no
arguments are given, the current terminal status is given.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    baud	int = 0		If nonzero, the system takes the
				  argument as the new baud rate.
    ncols	int = 0		If nonzero, the argument becomes
				  the number of columns per screen.
    nlines	int = 0		If nonzero, the argument becomes
				  the number of lines per screen.
.fi
.le
.ke

.ks
.ls TAIL files

Print the last few lines of each of the named text files on the
standard output.

.nf
Hidden Parameters:
    nlines	int = 12	Number of lines to print.

Remove delete protection from the named files.  It is not considered
an error to attempt to remove protection from a file which is not protected.
