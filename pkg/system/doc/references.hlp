.help references Jun89 system
.ih
NAME
references -- find all help database references to a given topic
.ih
USAGE
references topic
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls topic
The topic for which help is desired, i.e., a keyword, phrase, or pattern
which the help database or quick-reference file is to be searched for.
.le
.ls quickref = "uparm$quick.ref"
The name of the optional quick-reference file.
.le
.ls updquick = no
Create or update the quick-reference file, e.g., because new packages
have been added to the global help database.  Updating the quick-reference
file automatically enables \fIusequick\fR, discussed below.
.le
.ls usequick = no
Use the quick-reference file.  By default, a runtime search of all the package
menus in the full help database is performed, which ensures that all packages
are searched, but which is comparatively slow.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIreferences\fR task is used to search the help database for all tasks
or other help modules pertaining to the given topic, where \fItopic\fR may be
a keyword, phrase, or any general pattern as would be input to the \fImatch\fR
task.  By default the full help database will be searched.  If desired,
the "one-liner" information used for topic searching may be extracted and
used to prepare a quick-reference file to speed further searches.
This is not done by default because the help database is too dynamic, e.g., 
new external packages may be installed at any time, by any user, or new
tasks may be added to existing packages at any time.

References to tasks (or other objects) are printed in the form

.nf
       keyword1 - one line description
       keyword2 - one line description
.fi

and so on.  To determine the \fIpackage pathname\fR of each named task,
get \fIhelp\fR on the named \fIkeyword\fR and the pathname will be seen at
the top of the help screen, followed by additional information about the
referenced object.  If there are multiple objects with the same name,
a "help <keyword> all+" may be required to locate a particular one.

EXAMPLES
1. Find all help on CCDs.

.nf
	cl> ref ccd
.fi

2. Create or update your private quick-reference file.

.nf
	cl> ref upd+
.fi

3. Examine the quick-reference file to get a summary of all the tasks
or other help modules in the help database.

.nf
	cl> page (ref.quickref)
.fi

TIME REQUIREMENTS
If a quick-reference file is used searching takes seconds, otherwise it
might take a minute or so for the typical large help database containing
all help modules for the core system and several external, layered packages.
.ih
BUGS
Only the one-liner (NAME) field describing each help module is used for
the searches.  With a little work searching could be made much more
comprehensive as well as faster.
