NAME
concatenate -- connect files together into one big file
.ih
USAGE
concatenate files [output_file]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls files
The list of input files.  The standard input, STDIN, may be specified to
interactively enter a few lines of text rather than read from a disk file.
All input files should be of the same type (binary or text).
.le
.ls output_file
The name of the output file.  If no file is explicitly specified the
standard output (STDOUT) is used.
.le
.ls out_type = in_type
The output file type is forced if this parameter is defined as "binary"
or "text".  If "out_type" does not begin with a "b" (or "B"), or a
"t" ("T"), then the output type is either "text", if the output file is
the standard output, or is determined from the type of the first input file.
.le
.ls append = no
If set to "yes", "files" are appended to "output_file".
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Each file in the input file list is appended to the output file.
If "output_file" is not the standard output, and if output redirection (">")
was not specified on the command line, the resulting stream of data is placed
in a file.  The input can be STDIN, which makes for an easy way to enter a
few lines of text into a file (but \fItype\fR is usually more convenient).
If entering data via the standard input, type the end of file character,
e.g., <ctrl/z>, to terminate the input sequence.

EXAMPLES

1. Write out file1, followed by file2, to the terminal screen.  Note that
there must be no space after the comma.

.nf
	cl> concatenate file1,file2
.fi

2. Write out files file1 and file2 into the new file "outfile".

.nf
	cl> concatenate file1,file2 outfile
.fi

3. Copy what you type (up to the end-of-file character) into the file junk.

.nf
	cl> concatenate STDIN junk
.fi

4. Write out the contents of each of the files whose names are given in "list",
one per line, and append this data to "junk".

.nf
	cl> concatenate @list junk append+
.fi

5. Concatenation is also possible using \fItype\fR, e.g., the following
command will append the contents of "file" to the file "outfile", which will
be created if it does not already exist.

.nf
	cl> type file >> outfile
.fi

The redirect-append operator ">>" may be used to append the output of any
task to a file.

.ih
NOTES
All input files should be of the same type, either all "text" or all
"binary".
