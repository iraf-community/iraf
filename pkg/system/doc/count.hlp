DESCRIPTION
For each file, count determines the number of lines, words, and
characters in the file.  A word is defined as a sequence of characters
delimited by one or more blanks or tabs, or by the end of a line.
If \fIcount\fR is run on more than one file, each output line is identified
by the file name, and a final output line gives the total number
of lines, words, and characters in all files.
