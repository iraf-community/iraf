DESCRIPTION
\fIRewind\fR rewinds the specified device, which is most likely
a magnetic tape, and which has been previously allocated to the user.

By default \fIrewind\fR will initialize the device position cache.  When
changing tapes, one should always either rewind or deallocate and reallocate
the device, to force the magtape system to recompute the number of files
on the tape and to ensure that the tape is left in a defined position.

EXAMPLES

1. Rewind logical tape drive a.
