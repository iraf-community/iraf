.ih
USAGE
rename file newname
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls file
A template specifying the file or files to be renamed.
.le
.ls newname
If a single file is being renamed, the new filename, else the new name of
the field being renamed in a set of filenames.  If \fInewname\fR is a
directory the input files will be moved to this directory with the same
name.
.le
.ls field = all
If set to "all" the image name remains unchanged and the \fInewname\fR is
assumed to be a destination directory in the case of multiple input files,
or the new filename in the case of a single input file.  Otherwise,
specifies either the "root" or the "extn" field as the one to be modified.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fIRename\fR renames either a single file to "newname", or a set of files,
changing either the root or the extension part of each name.  If \fInewname\fR
is a directory the input files are moved to this directory and the filenames
remain the same regardless of the \fIfield\fR value.  When modifying the 
root or extension part of the filename \fInewname\fR is the new root or
extension name for the input files.  For multiple input files it is assumed
that \fInewname\fR is a directory is the value of \fIfield\fR is "all", 
otherwise an error is generated to prevent overwriting files.
