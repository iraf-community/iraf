NAME
help -- print online documentation for the named modules or packages
.ih
USAGE
help [template]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls template
A string listing the modules or packages for which help is desired.
Each list element may be a simple name or a pattern matching template.
Abbreviations are permitted.  If \fItemplate\fR is omitted a long format
menu will be printed for the current package, listing each task (or
subpackage) and describing briefly what it is.
.le
.ls file_template = no
If this switch is set the template is interpreted as a filename matching
template, and all help blocks found in the named files are output.  The help
database is not searched, hence manual pages can be printed or documents
may be formatted without entering the files into a help database.
In other words, "help file.hlp fi+" makes it possible to use \fIhelp\fR as
a conventional text formatter.
.le
.ls all = no
Print help for all help modules matching \fItemplate\fR, rather than only the
first one found.
.le
.ls parameter = "all"
If the value of this parameter is not "all", only the help text
for the given parameter will be printed.
.le
.ls section = "all"
If the value of this parameter is not "all", only the help text for the
given section (e.g. "usage", "description", "examples") will be printed.
.le
.ls option = help
The option parameter specifies the type of help desired, chosen from
the following:
.ls
.ls help
Print the full help block for the named module.
.le
.ls source
Print the source code for the module (which often contains additional
detailed comments).
.le
.ls sysdoc
Print the technical system documentation for the named module.
.le
.ls directory
Print a directory of all help blocks available for the named package.
.le
.ls alldoc
Print all help blocks in the file containing the help block for
the named procedure (i.e., both the user and system documentation).
.le
.ls files
Print the names of all help files associated with the named modules or
packages.
.le
.ls summary
Print only the titles and sizes of help blocks in referenced help files.
The contents of the blocks are skipped.  Titles are printed for \fIall\fR
help blocks found in the file containing the help block for the named module.
.le
.le
.le
.ls page = yes
Pause after every page of output text.  Turning this off for large documents
speeds up output considerably.
.le
.ls nlpp = 59
The number of lines per page if output is redirected, e.g., to \fIlprint\fR.
.le
.ls lmargin = 1
Left margin on output.
.le
.ls rmargin = 72
Right margin on output.
.le
.ls helpdb = "helpdb"
The filename of the help database to be searched.  If the \fIvalue\fR of the
parameter is the reserved string "helpdb", the actual filename is the value
of the CL environment variable \fIhelpdb\fR.
.le
.ls device = "terminal"
Output device if the standard output is not redirected.  If the \fIvalue\fR of
the parameter is the reserved string "terminal",  the actual device name is
the value of the CL environment variable \fIterminal\fR.  Only terminal
devices are permitted; \fBhelp\fR will not write directly to a printer device.
.le
.ih
BASIC USAGE
Despite the complex appearing hidden parameters, \fBhelp\fR is easy to use
for simple tasks.  \fBHelp\fR is most commonly used to get help on the current
package, and to get help on a program named in a CL menu.  To get help on
the current package one need only type \fBhelp\fR without any arguments.
For example, if the current package is \fBplot\fR, the command and its output
might appear as follows:

.nf
	pl> help
		contour - Make a contour plot of an image
		  graph - Graph one or more image sections or lists
		   pcol - Plot a column of an image
		  pcols - Plot the average of a range of image columns
		   prow - Plot a line (row) of an image
		  prows - Plot the average of a range of image lines
		surface - Make a surface plot of an image
	pl>
.fi

To get help on a module one supplies the module name as an argument,

	pl> help graph

and the manual page for the \fBplot.graph\fR program will be printed on the
terminal.  To get a hardcopy of the manual page on the printer, the output
may be redirected to the line printer, as follows:

	pl> help graph | lprint
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The function of the \fBhelp\fR program is to perform a depth first search
of the help database \fIhelpdb\fR, printing help for all packages and modules
matching the template.  By default the standard IRAF help database is searched,
but any other help database may be searched if desired.  A help database is
precompiled with the \fBmkhelpdb\fR program to speed up runtime searches for
help modules.  The standard IRAF help database contains the documentation and
source for all CL programs and system and math library procedures installed
in IRAF.

A help template is a string type parameter to the CL.  The form of a template
is a list of patterns delimited by commas, i.e.,

	"pattern1, pattern2, ..., patternN"

The form of a pattern is

	package_pattern.module_pattern

If the "." is omitted \fImodule_pattern\fR is assumed.  The standard pattern
matching metacharacters, i.e., "*?[]", are permitted in patterns.
Simple patterns are assumed to be abbreviations.

EXAMPLES

1. Print the help text for the program \fIdelete\fR in the package
\fIsystem\fR (output will be directed to the terminal):

.nf
	cl> help system.delete
or
	cl> help delete
or
	cl> help del
.fi

2. Print the help text on the line printer:

	cl> help delete | lprint

3. Print help for the current package:

	cl> help

4. Print the usage section of all modules in the package \fBimages\fR:

	cl> help images.* section=usage

5. Print a directory of all help blocks in the packages \fBclpackage\fR
and \fBclio\fR (and any others whose names begin with the string "cl"):

	cl> help cl* op=dir

6. Print a directory of each package in the database (useful for getting an
overview of the contents of a help database):

	cl> help * op=dir

7. Print the source for all of the string utilities in the system library
package \fBfmtio\fR:

	cl> help fmtio.str* op=source

8. Find all tasks that delete something:

	cl> help * | match delete

9. Print the manual pages for the \fIhelp\fR and \fIlprint\fR tasks on the
default printer device:

	cl> help help,lprint | lpr

10. Capture the manual page for task \fIhedit\fR in a text file, in a form
suitable for printing on any device.

	cl> help hedit | type dev=text > hedit.txt

BUGS
On some systems, typing the next command keystroke before the end-of-page
prompt is printed may result in the character being echoed (messing up the
output) and then ignored when raw mode is enabled for the prompt.
