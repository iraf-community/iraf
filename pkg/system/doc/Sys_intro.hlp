Basic IRAF System Utilities

    A number of standard utilities are available as part of the IRAF
user interface.  These utilities, most of which operate on files, are
summarized later in this document.  A general discussion of files in
the IRAF system follows.  The reader is assumed to have some familiarity
with the IRAF command language (CL).

.sh
Virtual File Names

    File names may be specified in a machine independent fashion, or with
OS dependent pathnames.  A Virtual File Name (VFN) has the following form:

.nf
	ldir$root.extn
.fi

where

.nf
	ldir		logical directory or device name
	root		root or base file name
	extn		extension denoting the type of file
.fi

The LDIR and EXTN fields are optional.  The ROOT and EXTN fields may contain
up to 20 characters selected from the set [a-zA-Z0-9_.+-#].  The EXTN field
may not exceed three characters.  The EXTN field is separated from the ROOT
by the character "." (dot).  If the ROOT field contains one or more occurrences
of the dot character, the final dot delimited field is understood to be
the extension.

Logical directories are defined in the CL, using the SET command to associate
an OS dependent pathname with a keyword in the environment table.  Logical
directory prefixes are recursively expanded.

A number of standard logical directories and devices are defined by the CL
at startup time.  Additional logical directories are defined by applications
packages upon entry, and become undefined when dictionary space is reclaimed
on exit from the package.  The user may override environment definitions at
will, by issuing SET commands to redefine environment variables.

.sh
File List Templates

    Whenever it makes sense, the IRAF utilities are set up to process a list
of files, rather than a single file.  In the descriptions of the standard
utilities in the next section, "files" is a template or pattern specifying
a list of files to be processed in some way.  The template is a string type
parameter to the CL, which is expanded by a procedure (CLGFIL) in the
compiled systems or applications task into an EOF terminated list of files.

A template may consist of one or more file names, directory names,
list file names, or patterns.  List elements are delimited by commas.
A list file is denoted by prepending the character "@" to the pathname
of the list file.  A pattern may be applied to the contents of either
a list file or a directory.  The pattern is separated from the list file
or directory name by the character "$".  A pattern all by itself is
applied to the current directory.  Either logical or OS dependent
pathnames may be used.

A list element may refer only to a single directory.  Thus, one cannot
specify a pattern such as "*/*.x", as is possible in UNIX.

Some examples of templates follow:

.nf
	file
	"file1, file2"
	"*.x"
	"[A-Z]*, *.com, ../$, ../fio/$*.x, lib$*.h, file, @list$*.vs"
	"sia1:[iraf.lib]$*.h, uparm$cl_*.par"
.fi

The magic filenames "STDIN", "STDOUT", and "STDERR" have a special
meaning.  Passing one of these special filenames to a task causes
the named stream to be "reopened", transparently to the applications
program.  Thus, for example, one can reference "STDIN" in a template,
and the applications program will read from the standard input when
it opens the corresponding file in the template.

For example,

.nf
	cl> concat "file1, @STDIN, STDIN, file2", > ofile
.fi

concatenates the file "file1", the contents of the files named in the
standard input (until the first EOF), the contents of the standard input
itself (until the second EOF), and the contents of the file "file2",
placing the output in the file "ofile".

.sh
File Protection and Clobber

    The IRAF file interface (FIO) provides file protection and synchronization
facilities, under control of user definable environment variables.

File "clobber" refers to the overwriting of an existing file when a new
file of the same name is created as an output file.  If "clobber" is
defined as "no" in the environment, an IRAF task will abort if a new file
would clobber an existing file.  If file clobber is enabled, FIO will try
to overwrite the old file, and will abort if it cannot do so.

.nf
	cl> set clobber = "yes"
.fi

More explicit file protection is provided by the CL commands PROTECT and
UNPROTECT.  A protected file cannot be deleted, accidentally or otherwise,
until the protection has been removed with the UNPROTECT command or system
call.

A final form of file protection is provided to prevent a file from being
clobbered which is already open by a task.  Thus, "COPY file,file" will
abort when FIO discovers that "file" is already opened for reading.  This
holds even if file clobber is enabled.

.sh
File Synchronization

    File synchronization is useful when a process requires exclusive access
to a file which is already open for exclusive access by another process.  
When this situation occurs, the second task may abort with a message stating
that it cannot access the file, or the task may wait for the file to become
available.  File waiting is especially important for batch processes.

.nf
	cl> set file_wait = "yes"
.fi

The file wait option is controlled by the "file_wait" variable in the
environment.  If file waiting is enabled, and a process finds that it
has to wait to access a file, a warning message will be printed on the
standard error output before the affected process goes to sleep.
