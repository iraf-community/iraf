NAME
bench -- simple benchmark tool
.ih
USAGE
bench
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The BENCH task provides a simple benchmark meant to simulate CCD processing
of three images.  The tasks used exercise both disk- and CPU-intensive
applications and offer a crude comparison of performance between machines, 
but it is not intended to be a comprehensive benchmark.  There are no
parameters.

EXAMPLES
1. Run the benchmark:

.nf
    ecl> bench
            
    Bench started at 09:45:58
                             
    =====> Making images...  
             Making zero...  
             Making flat...  
             Making 3 objs...
                             
    =====>   Normalizing flat...
    	:
    
    =====>   Subtracting zero from 3 images...    
    	:
    
    =====>   Dividing flat into 3 images...       
    	:
    
    =====>   Combining 3 images...
    	:
    
    =====>   Median filtering image...
    	:
    
    =====>   Deleting all images...
