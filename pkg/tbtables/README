This directory contains the source for the SDAS table I/O routines.  All
procedure names begin with "tb".  The next letter usually gives some idea of
the kind of object the procedure deals with (t - table, r - row, c - column,
p - parameter, h - header parameter).  Procedures beginning with "tbx", "tby",
"tbf" or "tbz" are lower-level routines for row-ordered tables, column-ordered
tables, FITS tables or text tables respectively.

The top-level procedures are listed in calls.doc in the doc subdirectory.

A description of the file format of a table is given by fileformat.doc in
the doc subdirectory.
