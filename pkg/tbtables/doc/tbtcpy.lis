Here is the algorithm for determining the type of output table that
will be created when calling tbtcpy:

	if output == STDOUT then

	    type = text

	else if extension of output file is .fits (or .fit or .??f) then

	    type = fits

	else if extension of output file is .qp

	    type = row			# but in a qpoe file

	else if input is text file or STDIN then

	    # text --> text, except for extensions .tab, .fits, .qp

	    if extension of output file is .tab
		type = row
	    else			# .fits & .qp taken care of above
		type = text
	    end if

	else

	    type = row

	end if
