This file describes changes in the STSDAS table format for the various
software versions, from 0 to 3.  For an STSDAS table, the software version
number can be found in the size-information record; see fileformat.doc.

version = 0 (before stsdas and tables package version 1.3):
This is the original version.  Data types supported were single and double
precision real, integer, logical, and character strings.  Each table element
was a multiple of four bytes in length (i.e. the size of single precision
real, integer, or logical).  The row length was also a multiple of four
bytes.  Data type short (integer*2) was not supported.

version = 1 (1993 May 5, tables package version 1.3):
Data type short is supported, and the length of a character string is rounded
up to a multiple of two instead of four.  The row length (used or allocated)
can be an odd multiple of SZ_CHAR (i.e. a multiple of two bytes instead of
four bytes).

version = 2 (1995 Oct 11, tables package version 1.3.4):
Header parameters can have associated comments.  The value of a header
parameter that is of type text may optionally be enclosed in single quotes;
this is to allow a comment following the value.  Header parameters with
keyword HISTORY, COMMENT or blank are not in quotes and may not have comments.

version = 3 (1998 Apr 14, tables package version 2.0.2):
The character strings in column definitions can have one more character
than before.  This was done by not including the end-of-string character if
the string fills the available space.
