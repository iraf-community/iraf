1. INTERACTIVE NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES FITTING CURSOR OPTIONS

?       Print options
c       Print coordinates and fit of point nearest the cursor
d       Delete point nearest the cursor
f       Do the fit and redraw or overplot the graph
g       Redefine graph keys.  The following data types may be along
        either axis.
            function    Dependent variable, or function
            fit         Fitted value
            residuals   Residuals (function - fit)
            ratio       Ratio (function / fit)
            nonlinear   Nonlinear component of function
            var n       Independent variable number "n"
            identifier  Independent variable "identifier" (if defined)
            user n      User defined plot function (if defined)
h-l     Graph keys.  The defaults are the following.
	    h=(function, fit)
	    i=(function, residual)
            j=(function, ratio)
	    k=(var 1, residual)
	    l=(user 1, user 2)
o       Overplot the next graph
q       Exit interactive curve fitting
r       Redraw graph
t	Overplot fit
u       Undelete the deleted point nearest the cursor
w       Set graph window.
	    For help type 'w' followed by '?' after the prompt.
I       Interrupt task immediately


2. INTERACTIVE NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES FITTING COLON COMMANDS

The parameters are listed or set with the following commands which may be
abbreviated.  To list the value of a parameter type the command alone.

:show [file]               Print the values of the task fitting parameters
:variables [file]	   Print the variable names, min and max values
:data [file]		   Print the values of all the variables
:errors [file]             Print an error analysis of the fit
:results [file]		   Print the results of the fit
:vshow [file]              Print an error analysis and results of the fit
:page file		   Page through a file
:const [param] [value]     Change parameter to constant parameter
:fit [param] [value]       Change parameter to fitting parameter
:tolerance [value]	   Show/set the convergence criteria
:maxiter [value]	   Show/set the maximum number of fitting iterations
:nreject [value]           Show/set the maximum number of rejection iterations
:low_reject [value]        Show/set the low rejection threshold
:high_reject [value]       Show/set the high rejection threshold
:grow [value]              Show/set the rejection growing radius

Additional commands are available for setting graph formats and manipulating
the graphics.  Use the following commands for help.

:/help       Print help for graph formatting option
:.help       Print help for general graphics options


3. INTERACTIVE NONLINEAR LEAST SQUARES FITTING GRAPH KEYS

The graph keys are h, i, j, k, and l.  The graph keys may be redefined to
put any combination of axes types along either graph axis with the 'g' key.
To define a graph key select the desired key to redefine and then specify
the axes types for the horizontal and vertical axes by a pair of comma
separated types from the following (they may be abreviated up to three
characters, except for 'identifier'):

function    Dependent variable
fit         Fitted value
ratio       Ratio (function / fit)
residuuals  Residuals of fit (function - fit)
nonlinear   Nonlinear part of data (linear component of fit subtracted)
var [n]     Indepedent variable number "n"
user [n]    User defined plot equation "n" (if defined)
identifier  Independent variable named "identifier" (if defined)
