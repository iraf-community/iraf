CATALOGS

A catalog is a large set of tabular data records from which smaller 
tabular data sets can be extracted by issuing a catalog server query. Catalogs
may be installed locally or accessed remotely. Installing a catalog involves
creating a record in the catalog configuration file which specifies the
catalog network address, the catalog query format, and the catalog query
output format. In the following sections the configuration file is
described in the context of accessing astrometric catalogs.

.ih
THE CATALOG CONFIGURATION FILE

A record in the catalog configuration file specifies the network address,
the query format, and the output format of each supported catalog server.
Catalog server records names have the form "catalog@site",
e.g. "usno2@noao". Adding support for a new catalog server or responding
to changes in the behavior of an already supported server requires either adding
a new record to the configuration file or changing an existing record in
the configuration file. It does not require changing the catalog
access code.

The catalog server network address tells the catalog access code where
and how to connect to the network. Each network address has the syntax
"domain:port:address:flags" e.g. "inet:80:www.noao.edu:text".

The query format specifies the form of the query server string, and the
names, default values, units, and format of the query parameters. A set of
query parameter names are reserved for accessing astrometric catalogs
including "ra", "dec", "radius", "hwidth", "width", "rawidth", "decwidth",
rahwidth, and dechwidth. The names of these parameters are not part of the
catalog access API. Other types of catalogs may have different reserved
query parameter names. The user replaces the default query values with user
query parameter values before making the query.

The server query output format specifies the form of the expected server output:
including the data stream type, the record size, and the name, location,
size, data type, units and format of each field in the record. A set of
standard field names is reserved for accessing the output of astrometric
catalog servers including "id", "ra", "dec", and "mag[1-n]". These standard
field names are not part of the catalog access API. Other catalog
types may have a different set of standard field names in the future.

SAMPLE CATALOG RECORD

The following two examples illustrate typical catalog configuration file
records. Note that both records can be used to access the same catalog
data. The first example accesses the catalog as simple text, the latter
as blocked text.

The beginning of a new catalog record is indicated by a line of the form
\fI"begin catname"\fR where catname is a unique name of the form
\fI"catalog@site"\fR. If there is more than one record with the same
name, the last record is the one that is read. The same catalog server
may be accessed in more than one way by creating multiple records.
For example if the catalog server supports an optional magnitude selection
feature, then in one record this feature can be enabled and in another it
can be disabled. 

The \fIaddress\fR, \fIquery\fR and \fInquery\fR keywords are required and
define the network address, query command, format and query parameters for
the catalog.

The \fIaddress\fR keyword  "domain", "port", and "flags" fields are almost
always "inet", "80", and "text" respectively, so in most cases the only
address keyword field that has to be filled in is the address
field "www.noao.edu" in this case.

The \fIquery\fR keyword defines the query command whose form is server
dependent. The query parameter values are encoded via the %-s formatting
strings. The calling program must encode the user query parameter values
into a set a strings which then replace the -%s format statement in the
query string.

The number of query parameters is defined by the \fInquery\fR keyword. The
number of query parameters must be greater than or equal to the number of "-%s"
strings in the query keyword value. The name,  default value, units,
and format of each query parameter are listed below the nquery keyword,
one query parameter description per line. The query parameters should
be defined in the catalog configuration file in the same order that they
appear in the query keyword value. Alert readers will notice that in
the examples above the number of query parameters is 4 but there are only
3 "%-s" strings in the query keyword value. In these examples the qsystem
query parameter, which defines the coordinate system of the ra and dec query
parameter values is fixed at J2000. For some servers this parameter may
be a true query parameter, i.e.  the server may accept coordinates in
B1950 or J2000 or some other coordinate system.

For astrometric catalogs the reserved query parameter names "ra", "dec", and
"qysystem" should be used to define the extraction region center and its
coordinate system, and one or more of "radius", "width", "xwidth", and
"ywidth" should be used to define the extraction region size. The units
of "ra" should be "hours", "degrees", or "radians", the units of dec
should be "degrees" or "radians", and units of the size query parameter
should be "degrees" or "minutes". The qsystem parameter value may be
any one of the supported celestial coordinate systems. The most common
qsystem values are "icrs", "J2000", or "B1950". The query parameter
formats are used to convert numerical values supplied by the calling
program to string values that can be passed to the query string.
It should be emphasized that the reserved query parameter names and units
are conventions that are adopted to simplify writing the configuration
file and astrometric applications. They are not part of the catalog
access API itself.

The \fItype\fR keyword defines the form of the query output. The current options
are "stext" for simple text and "btext" for blocked text. Simple text 
contains newline delimited records with whitespace delimited fields.
Blocked text contains newline delimited records and fixed position and size
fields. If the type keyword is missing "stext" is assumed.

The \fIrecsize\fR keyword is the length of the record in characters including
the newline character. If the record size is variable recsize should be set
t0 0. If undefined the recsize keyword defaults to 0 for variable record
size.

The \fIhskip\fR, \fItskip\fR, \fIltrim\fR, and \fItrim\fR define the number
of leading and trailing records in the query output to sky, and the
number of leading and trailing characters in each record to trim, i.e.
replace with blanks. If absent these keywords default to zero.

The \fInheader\fR keyword defines the number of header keywords. Header
keyword values are global quantities which apply to the catalog server
output as a whole. There may be 0 or many header keywords.

For most astrometry catalog the most important and often only header keyword
is \fIcsystem\fR which defines the coordinate system of the query output
coordinates, i.e. if csystem is "J2000" then the coordinates of objects
extracted from the catalog are in "J2000".

The \fInfields\fR keyword defines the number of fields in the query output
records.  The name, offset, size, datatype, units, and format of each field
follow, one field description per line. For simple text files the offset
is field or column number and the size is 0 meaning undefined. For blocked
text files the offset is the 1-indexed position of the first character (which
may be blank) in the field and size is the field size in characters where
the field size includes trailing blanks. Using a blocked text description may
be required for dealing with fields containing embedded blanks. The type
defines the preferred data type of a field. In the examples above the ra and
dec are assigned double precision data types. This means that for precision
reasons the calling program should but is not required to read these
quantities into double precision variables. The units information is
used to perform any required coordinate conversions, and the format information
is used in cases where the calling program must decode a field, perform
some numerical operation on it, and reencode it with the original precision.

For astrometric catalogs the reserved standard field names "id", "ra", "dec",
"mag#" etc should be used to define the standard field names. The current
standard field name list is \fIid\fR, \fIra\fR, \fIdec\fR, \fRera\fR,
\fIedec\fR, \fIpmra\fR, \fIpmdec\fR, \fIepmra\fR, \fIepmdec\fR,
\fIcatsystem\fR, \fIequinox\fR, \fIepoch\fR, \fIpx\fR, \fIrv\fR, \fIepx\fR,
\fIerv\fR, \fImag\fR, \fIcolor\fR, \fIemag\fR, \fIecolor\fR, \fIxp\fR,
\fIyp\fR, \fIxc\fR, \fIyc\fR, \fIexc\fR, \fIeyc\fR, \fIimag\fR, and \fIeimag\fR.
At a minimum an astrometric catalog must contain the "ra" and "dec" fields.
The units of the ra field must be "hours", "degrees", or "radians"
and the units of the "dec" field must be "degrees" or "radians". The
other standard fields are optional and define quantities like: proper
motions in ra and dec, the coordinate system, equinox, and epoch
of observation, parallax, radial velocity, magnitude and color information,
and predicted image pixel coordinates. The definitions and default units
for all these quantities are defined more fully in the help for the
astrometry package.  It should be emphasized that the reserved field names
and units names are conventions that are adopted to simplify writing the
configuration file and astrometric applications. They are not part of
the catalog access API itself.
