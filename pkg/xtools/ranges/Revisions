xtools$ranges/rgranges.x
    The range parsing would fail for single numbers.  (4/29/94, Valdes)

xtools$ranges/rgranges.x
xtools$ranges/rgxranges.gx
    Added @file capability.  Rewrote the parsing logic.  (10/9/91, Valdes)

xtools$ranges/rgwtbin.gx
    At least one point from each sample region must be included regardless
    of the size of average.  (6/14/89, Valdes)

xtools$ranges/rgwtbin.gx
    The remainder bin in a sample region must be at least
    max (min (N, 3), (N+1)/2) except that a single bin may be any size. 
    (6/7/89, Valdes)
 
xtools$ranges/rgencode.x, rginverse.x, rgnext.x, rgunion.x
    Added some missing functionality to convert a range into a string,
    to invert a range, to get the next higher member of a range (ala
    xtools$ranges.x) and to take the union of two ranges.
    (6/2/89, Seaman)

xtools$ranges/rgintersect.x, rgmerge.x
    Fixed bugs in handling overlapping ranges.  (6/2/89, Seaman)

xtools$ranges/rgxranges.gx
    Numbers in scientific notation are now recognized.  Based on report
    from Ivo Busko.  (3/1/89)
 
xtools$ranges/rgwtbin.gx
    The remainder bin in a sample region must be at least max (3, (N+1)/2)
    except that a single bin may be any size.  (1/23/89, Valdes)

    1.  Since AMED$T no longer modifies the input array the temporary arrays
	used to preserve the input array are no longer needed.

xtools$ranges: Valdes, August 11, 1986
    1.  Reorganized package to have separate modules for each datatype.
	This allows loading only the required procedures.

xtools$ranges/rgwtbin.gx: Valdes, August 8, 1986
    1.  If all the weights were zero in a given range then a divide by zero
	would result.  A check against this was added.

xtools$ranges: Valdes, March 13, 1986
    1.  The RANGES package has been converted to generic form.  It is compiled
	into both single and double precision procedures.
