pkg$xtools/center1d.x
    In the case that the position correction flipped back and forth about the
    center no center would be found.  In this case I added a check to
    divide the correction factor in half.  (3/13/90, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/numrecipes.x +
    Add some procedures for generating Gaussian and Possion deviates
    as well as an implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear
    chi square minimization algorithm.  These routines are either
    direct implementations from Numerical Recipes or based on descriptions
    in that book. (10/25/89, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/dttext.x
    Commented out the diagnostic message in dtlocate.  (7/19/89, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
pkg$xtools/doc/center1d.hlp
    If the centering width is less than or equal to 1 the nearest minima or
    maxima is found.  As before, a minimum width of 3 is used if
    the width is between 1 and 3.  (7/13/89, Valdes)

Version 2.8
===========

pkg$xtools/logfiles.x
    Added these routines to open and to close a list of logfiles.
    (6/2/89, Seaman)

pkg$xtools/ranges.x
    Fixed a bunch of bugs in the zero handling, the MAX_INT handling and
    that made the step notation flaky.  Made a comma a hard separator
    between two ranges rather than mere whitespace.  (6/2/89, Seaman)

pkg$xtools/xtmksections.x
    A 2D image with second dimension length of 1 is returned without
    an image section from xt_mk1d and xt_mksection.  (1/31/89, Valdes)
 
pkg$xtools/xtsort.x
    Added a double precision version of the three vector sorter, named
    xt_sort3d.  It required a double precision version of xts_compared.
    This change was to support the utilities.curfit task, which now
    sorts its input list data before fitting.  (6/24/88 ShJ)

pkg$xtools/xtsums.x
    When the number of lines or columns is 1 and the line or column is the
    same as a previous call and a data is null then a new vector is not read
    causing uninitialized data to be returned.  Added l1=0 and c1=0 to fix
    problem.  This problem appeared in proto.toonedspec.  (2/12/88 Valdes)

pkg$xtools/mksection.x
    User specified section strings of the form "column 051" are now
    converted to [51,*] instead of [051,*]. (11/9/87 Valdes)

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
pkg$xtools/doc/center1d.hlp
    Valdes, April 2, 1987:
    1.  A bug with testing the right edge of the data was fixed.  This caused
	FPE errors on AOS/IRAF.
    2.  The centering fails if the maximum number of iterations is reached
	or the changes do not continue to decrease within 3 iterations of
	the last minimum change.
    3.  Defined parameters replaced constants used in the code.

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
pkg$xtools/doc/center1d.hlp
    Valdes, March 5, 1987:
    1.  A silent minimum of 3 is imposed on the width parameter.  If there
	is ever a need to allow smaller widths then the procedure can
	be changed and the application relinked.
    2.  The help page was modified to reflect this change.

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
    Valdes, October 29, 1986:
    1.  The first use of threshold was only as a data range limit.
	Now it is used to eliminate all peaks less than threshold from
	the continuum.  This fixes ever finding weak features less
	than threshold.

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
    Valdes, August 18, 1986:
    1.  Added a detection threshold parameter to CENTER1D.

====================================
Version 2.3 Release, August 18, 1986
====================================

cogetr.x: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Error in initializing the procedure cogetr fixed.

icfit$: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  ICFIT package replaced by a new version.

=====================================
STScI Pre-release and SUN 2.3 release
=====================================

icfit$icgfuncs.gx:  Valdes, June 18, 1986
    1.  DCVEVAL was being called in ICGFUNCS with a real argument when
	selecting the nonlinear plot (key 'l').  This caused an error
	on the SUN.  Changed "real" to PIXEL.

gtools$gtwindow.x:  Valdes, June 11, 1986
    1.  Added new procedure gt_window.  It is a cursor driven procedure
	for windowing graphs using the gtools pointer.  The help
	page for gtools was also modified to show the windowing options.

gtools$gtcur.x:  Valdes, May 10, 1986
    1.  Took out "Confirm:" prompt so that cursor input from a file does
	not cause anything to be printed.  Two EOF's (carriage return or
	actual EOF) or a 'q' are required to exit thus protecting the user
	from an inadvertent carriage return.

imt.x:  Valdes April 29, 1986
    1.  Modified the image template package to sort wildcard expansions.

icfit$icgfit.gx,icgfit2.x,icgcolon.x:  Valdes, April 7, 1986
    1.  Fixed use of STRIDX with a character constant to STRIDXS.
    2.  Fixed problem with colon usage for ":sample" and ":function"

xtools:  Valdes, March 24, 1985
    1.  Added XT_PHISTORY to put dated history string.

pkg$xtools/imtools.x:  Valdes, March 18, 1985
    1.  XT_MKIMTEMP modified to create the temporary image header in the
	user current directory with the prefix "tmp".
    2.  XT_DELIMTEMP modified to call IMRENAME instead of RENAME.

From Valdes March 13, 1986:

1.  Added procedure dtgad (database get array double) to dttext tools.
It's purpose is to accomodate double precisions curve fits.

2.  Added COGETR procedures for efficient column access.  A help page
is available.

3.  Added XTSUMS procedures for buffered sums (both column and line).
They are particularly useful for moving sums type of operations.  A help
page is available

4.  Added help pages for COGETR and XTSUMS procedures to help database.
------
From Valdes March 10, 1986:

1.  Added IMTREW rewind procedure to image template tools.

2.  Added IMTGIM procedure to get an image from the template by index number.
------
From Valdes March 5, 1986:

1.  Modified dttext to allow deleting a database.
===========
Release 2.2
===========
From Valdes Feb. 8, 1986:

1.  Modified XT_DELIMTEMP and DEL_IMTEMP to update the pixel header
file so that it correctly points to the header file after the header
file is renamed.
------
From Valdes Jan. 13, 1986:

1.  Changes in DTTEXT.X:
	a.  Size of OS filename in DTMAP1 extended from SZ_FNAME to
	    SZ_PATHNAME + SZ_FNAME.
	b.  Database directories do not allow periods in the names when
	    created.
2.  XTMKSECTION was computing the middle line (or column) as
len / 2 which gave zero for an image of length 1.  Changed to
(len + 1) / 2.
------
From Valdes Dec. 31, 1985:

1.  A bug in imt.x due to incorrect indexing in a string has been fixed.
------
From Valdes Nov. 22, 1985:

1.  A new procedure XT_GIDS has been added to find identifier tokens in a
string and match the identifiers against a dictionary string.  An array
of YES/NO values for each dictionary entry, up to a maximum of maxids,
is returned.  This procedure is useful for parsing an option string.
It is nice because identifiers can be abbreviated and delimiters can be
anything which is not an identifier token (whitespace, commas, colons,
semicolons, etc).
-----
From Valdes Nov. 15, 1985:

1.  Added DTMAP1 to DTTEXT.X text database package.  This procedure
takes a directory name as the database and stores or access text database
files in the directory under the file name key.  It maps the name
"database/key" and calls DTMAP.  This allows better organization of
database information into subfiles of a database rather than one massive
text file.  It calls DTMAP with the database name directly if the database
name is a regular file and not a directory.  Thus, it is backwards
compatible with older single file text databases.

2.  Added ISDIRECTORY.  This procedure tests a virtual file name to see
if it is a directory and returns the os pathname suitable for concatentation.
The function value is the number of characters in the pathname which is
0 for a nondirectory file.
cogetr.x: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Error in initializing the procedure cogetr fixed.
