inlfit/ingfit.gx
    The 'oldwts' pointer was being used explicitly with Memr, changed to use
    'Mem$t' so the appropriate type is used (5/4/13, MJF)

rmsorted.x
    A 64-bit problem was fixed.  (12/5/11, Valdes)

catquery/cqdef.x
catquery/cqquery.x
catquery/cqimquery.x
    Modified the URL access to use the new url_get() procedure as a
    compile-time option.  This allows access to servers that may
    redirect the URL or return some other http error. (10/5/11, MJF)

fixpix/ytpmmap.x
    The world matching was not right.  It may still have bugs but the
    discovered problem has been fixed.  (3/3/11, Valdes)

=======
2.15.1a
=======

pkg/xtools/icfit/icdeviant.gx
    There were two bugs related to growing.  First, the logic was wrong.
    Second, in one place the grow parameter was treated as being in pixels
    and in another as being in user coordinate units.
    (6/28/10, Valdes)

pkg/xtools/xtextns.x
     Pixel list masks were not recognized as images.
     (2/13/09, Valdes)

lib/pkg/rmsorted.h
pkg/xtools/rmmed.x
pkg/xtools/rmsorted.x
     Modified the running median library to allow running minimum and
     running maximum.  An argument addition required a change in the 
     runmed task but there was no functional change.
     (10/29/08, Valdes)

xtextns.x
    1.  The wrong ranges package was used for the extension versions.  Calling		the correct one requires extension versions to be positive integers.
    2.  The extension version was not being matched correctly.  This may
    	have happened when switching to using the mef library.
    (8/25/08, Valdes)

fixpix/ytpmmap.x
    The inefficiencies in evaluating the WCS were addressed.
    (3/18/08, Valdes)

fixpix/ytpmmap.x
    Fixed a couple of bugs that could result in a floating point exception.
    (3/17/08, Valdes)

rmsorted.x
    This routine was modified, including adding and argument, to
    support the clipping of bright values.
    (2/29/08, Valdes)

rmmed.x
    This general package of running median routines was moved from
    images$imfilter/src.  It was enhanced by allowing clipping of
    bright sources.  This means a new argument, nclip, is required.
    (2/29/08, Valdes)

fixpix/ytpmmap.x
    1.	Any number of '^' characters can be in the name at any point to
	invert or uninvert a mask.  This is needed if an application wants
	to invert the mask specified by the user which may also include '^'.
	This also allows strings like !^foo or ^!foo.
    2.	The pmmatch variable may not be "world N" where N is the maximum
	input mask value to be preserved in the output mask.  This value
	is used to optimize the internal bit array to the smallest it
	can be consistent with the desired value.  A value of "world"
	is equivalent to "world 1".
    (2/5/08, Valdes)

xtbitarray.x
    Generalized to support different number of bits per element.  The
    value is now set by specifying a maximum value.  All values greater
    than the maximum are set to the maximum.  (2/5/08, valdes)

inlfit/innlinit.gx
    Removed an extra argument from the nlfree$t() call (1/16/08, MJF)

fixpix/ytpmmap.x
    1.  A feature to match masks in world coordinates, but only as a
	boolean mask, was added.
    2.  The way the pixel mask matching is selected was generalized.
	The matching type is specified as a string with values
	"logical", "physical", "world", or "offset".  An application
	may also specify an environment variable which the user may
	use to specify the type.  If the application specifies one of
	the types then the environment variable "pmmatch" may be used
	to override the application.
    (1/9/08, Valdes)

xtbitarray.x	+
mkpkg
    This provides a package for creating an in-memory 2D bit array.
    This can be used for large boolean masks with random access.  It
    is being added for use with pixel mask matching in world coordinates.
    (1/9/08, Valdes)

=====
V2.14
=====

fixpix/setfp.x	+
    This routine transforms the input mask values into the output mask
    values.  It allows the input mask to have two classes of bad pixels;
    those which are interpolated and those which are not.

fixpix/ytpmmap.x
    Adds a procedure yt_mappm and internal argument to allow control of
    the WCS matching of masks to images.  The earlier versions always
    matched masks using the physical coordinate system.  Applications can
    the new procedure to have some control over this.
    (11/26/07, Valdes)

t_txtcompile.x	+
txtcompile	+
mkpkg
    This application compiles a text file into an SPP procedure that
    can be called by the xt_txtopen procedure.  The application is intended
    to be used as a host preprocessing command in mkpkg files to support
    things like host callable applications (e.g. see syshost).  The
    code is in xtools for savvy developers awaiting full integration.
    (11/26/07, Valdes)

xttxtfio.x	+
mkpkg
    The routines xt_txtopen and xt_txtclose follow the usual FIO
    interface.  They allow calling a procedure that sets a string file as
    if it was a read-only file.  (See the t_txtcompile.x procedure for a
    way to create a procedure from a text file.)  The file name for this
    special case of a procedure uses the syntax "proc:NNNNNN" where NNNNNN
    is the value returned by locpr.  The application would construct this
    name for the procedure it declares as extern.  The intended purpose is
    to allow building in configuration files, including a parameter file,
    into a host callable executable where unsatisfied parameter values
    default to a built-in file rather than issuing a prompt (see syshost).
    When called with an actual file normal read-only FIO is used.
    (11/26/07, Valdes)

syshost.x	+
mkpkg
    This routine may be used by an application to set default
    parameter values when the executable is called directly by the
    host.  The routine provides three files to search in order; two
    keyword=value files and a par file.  These files, primarily the
    par file, may be encoded as compiled procedures (see txtcompile
    and xt_txtopen/xt_txtclose) so that the binary can be distributed
    without any configuration files.  (11/26/07, Valdes)

xtextns.x
    Further restructuring of these routines to support binary tables.  This
    makes use the mef routines.  (11/26/07, Valdes)

=====
V2.13
=====

catquery/cqgfields.x
    The documentation says that the offset field in the catalog description
    file for simple text is the field number.  However, the implementation
    did not work this way.  The changes makes the catalog parsing work as
    described.  (7/17/07, Valdes)

xtextns.x		+
doc/xtextns.hlp		+
doc/xtools.hd
mkpkg
    Routines for expanding MEF image extensions.  The first version of
    this functionality was developed for proto.imextensions and then
    expanded for mscred.mscextensions.  Since then these routines have
    been used in other tasks and so these are now being escalated to
    generic xtools routines.  (3/20/07, Valdes)

xtmaskname.x
doc/xtmaskname.hlp	+
doc/xtools.hd
    The case where masktype=pl and the input name doesn't have a .pl
    extension was wrong.  (3/19/07, Valdes)

fixpix/ytfixpix.x	+
    This version uses an internal copy of the input mask rather than
    modifying the input mask.  (3/19/07, Valdes)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
fixpix/ytpmmap.x	+
fixpix/mkpkg
doc/xtpmmap.hlp		+
doc/xtools.hd
    1.	Uses xt_maskname to handle mask names.
    2.	Minor bug fixes.
    3.	The xt_ and yt_ versions are the same but the yt_version is
	present to allow external packages to check for the presence
	of ytpmmap.x and if not present use their own copy of the file.
	This allows these packages to be compiled with earlier versions.
	Eventually the yt versions should be obsoleted.
	(3/19/07, Valdes)

xtargs.x	+
mkpkg
	Simple interface to parse an argument string consisting of a list
	of whitespace separated keyword=value pairs.  (8/31/05, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.3
=======

rmsorted.x
lib$pkg/rmsorted.h
    This implements a sorted running median algorithm.
    (5/12/05, Valdes)

rmturlach.x
    This implements the Turlach running median algorithm from the R package.
    (5/12/05, Valdes)

xtsample.gx
    Utility to get a sample of pixels from an image.  (5/6/05, Valdes)

xtstat.gx
    Utility to compute a mean, sigma, median, and mode.  This is commonly
    used with xt_sample.  (5/6/05, Valdes)

fixpix/xtfp.x
    Wrong fix was made.  (1/4/05, Valdes)

fixpix/xtfp.x
    For reasons I can't understand, the column interpolation was broken.
    A loop over the columns was using ncols=FP_NCOLS, the number of bad pixels
    across columns, instead of nc=IM_LEN(im,1), the number of columns in
    the image.
    (6/22/04, Valdes)

numrecipes.x
    Added LU decomposition.  (6/18/04, 2004)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    1. The routines now allow selecting whether to match masks in physical
       coordinates or logical coordinates.  When matching in logical
       coordinates this simply means extending or trimming the mask if
       the sizes are not the same.
    2. Added a new routine xt_mappm which is now the prefered routine
       that allows selecting the matching type.  The previous xt_pmmap
       could not be changed since it used by various tasks.
    (6/18/04, Valdes)

xtmasknames.x
    Added routines that hand pixel mask names.  This is fairly sophisticated
    in dealing with whether or not the user specifies file extensions,
    image extensions, and flags.  It will produced masks in FITS extensions
    by default.  (6/16/04, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.2
=======

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    If the mask and data are offset by a fraction of a pixel it was possible
    to get an out-of-bounds error.  (8/14/03, Valdes)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    The loop over the range list in xt_match should start at 2 rather
    than 1.  (8/14/03, Valdes)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Added some error checks to avoid a segmentation violation in xt_pmtext
    when there is an error in im_pmmapo.  (9/16/02, Valdes)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    A common case of matching a mask to an image is where the pixel sizes
    are the same but there are offsets and/or different sizes.  An optimized
    mask matching based on using range lists and not calling mwcs was
    added.  (9/12/02, Valdes)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Added test for a pm pointer in xt_pmmap.  I can't remember why this
    is was added in the version in ACE but it seems right.  (9/10/02, Valdes)

fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    In the mask matching if there is no offset or sampling difference it
    was returning the mask unchanged even if the sizes are not the same.
    (9/10/02, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    The change to IMIO for mapping bad pixel files in FITS extensions
    resulted in a different error code when failing to open the file.
    This code needed to be recognized by this routine in order to
    continue on to try other possible formats.  (2/27/02, Valdes)

xtools$rngranges.x
    Further modification for INDEF range limits.  (2/4/02, Valdes)

xtools$rngranges.x
    Added missing rstr argument to 2 rng_error calls. (01/07/02, Davis)

xtools$catquery/cqquery.x
    Fixed a couple of typos in the code which detects the end of the http
    header. (01/03/02, Davis)

xtools$rngranges.x
xtools$rngranges.xBAK +
    Modified rng_add to handle INDEFs better.  This was the change found
    in the nmisc version.  There are some other differences but since the
    records of why the changes were made are missing I fixed only the
    immediate problem found with OBSUTIL.SPECFOCUS.
    (11/14/01, Valdes)

xtools$skywcs/doc/skdecim.hlp
xtools$skywcs/doc/skequatorial.hlp

xtools$skywcs/doc/skywcs.hlp
xtools$catquery/doc/catquery.hlp
xtools$catquery/doc/cqsqpar.hlp
xtools$catquery/doc/cqsqparn.hlp
    Fixed various formatting problems in the skywcs and catquery library
    help pages. (19/09/01, Davis)

xtools$catquery/
    Added the prototype catalog and survey access tools to the xtools package.
    (27/08/01, Davis)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Added missing argument to mw_ctrand calls.  (6/15/01, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Fixed problems with xt_match.  The new version is more robust and
    correct.  A bad pixel for the reference image is the maximum of all
    pixels in the pixel mask which fall within the reference pixel.   This
    version still does not allow any relative rotations but does allow
    non-integer offsets.  (4/24/01, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtfixpix.x
    Added a call to pm_compress to compress the pixel mask if there are
    more than a certain number of edits to avoid the memory inefficiency
    in plio.  (2/2/01, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    A mask name beginning with '^' is used to invert a mask.
    (2/1/01, Valdes)

xtools$inlfit.gx
xtools$inlfitr.x
xtools$inlfitd.x
xtools$inlrefit.gx
xtools$inlreffitr.x
xtools$inlrefitd.x
    Added a check for the condition case where the number of data points
    minus the number of deleted points (i.e. those with weights of 0.0)
    is less than the number of fitting parameters. The previous checks did
    not task into account the number of deleted points and could produce
    solutions that were correct but non-physical (1/2/01, Davis)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    1. The test for matching offsets was incorrect.
    2. The use of BPM was broken.
    3. There was a memory leak because imunmap does not free the pl
	pointer set with im_pmmapo (also there was an imio bug in
	freeing the pl pointer set with im_pmmap which has now been
	fixed).  A new procedure xt_pmunmap should be used whenever
	xt_pmmap is used to insure any internal pointer created by
	xt_match to match the mask to a reference image is freed.
    (12/12/00, Valdes)

xtools$skywcs/
    Added the sky coordinates transformation tools to the xtools package.
    (10/12/00, Davis)

=========
V2.11.3p1
=========

xtools/fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    A mask name begining with '!' is now treated as a reference to a
    header keyword.  (9/4/00, Valdes)

xtools/fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    When a pixel mask (overlay or bad pixel) needed to be matched to
    the data in physical coordinates the internal generation of a
    new mask was being done in short integers.  This would truncate
    any masks with values greater than 16 bits.  All uses of short
    where changed to integer.  (5/16/00, Valdes)

=========
V2.11.3p1
=========

=======
V2.11.3
=======

xtools$fixpix/xtfp.gx
    The formating of the verbose pixel printing was missing a couple of
    blanks.  (12/15/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

xtools$ranges/mkpkg
xtools$icfit/mkpkg
xtools$fixpix/mkpkg
xtools$mkpkg
    Added missing dependencies.  (10/11/99, Valdes)

xtools$inlfit/mkpkg
    Removed an uncessary file dependency from the mkpkg file. (20/9/99, Davis)

=======
V2.11.2
=======
xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Removed extra argument to imgl1i.  (8/11/99, Valdes)

xtools$imtools.x
    fnext is a function not a subroutine.  (8/11/99, Valdes)

xtools$xtanswer.x
    Fixed incorrect number of arguments in getline call.  (8/11/99, Valdes)

xtools$nlfit/inreject.x
xtools$nlfit/inrejectr.x
xtools$nlfit/inrejectd.x
    Rearranged the code to remove a missing sfree statement problem
    detected by spplint. (8/10/99, Davis)

xtools$center1d.x
    The step of finding a local maxima was not correct.  (4/19/99, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtfp.gx
    If there was no column interpolation the pixel type for the allocated
    data array was not set resulting in an error during xt_fpfree.
    (7/20/98, Valdes)

xtools$%xtimnames.x
    Modified extension testing code to use iki_validextn.
    (7/13/98, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtfp.gx
    Fixed a bug allowing out-of-bounds reference to FP_COL.
    (6/6/98, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    The steps to check if an image and mask have an integer relationship
    (integer sampling and integer offsets) in their physical coordinate
    systems could fail because real precision was not high enough
    in MWCS transformation calls.  Changed variables and MWCS calls
    to double.  (5/29/98, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    The XT_PMINVERT function has a bug in using the range list.
    (4/22/98, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtfixpix.h
xtools$fixpix/xtfixpix.x
xtools$fixpix/xtfp.gx
    The modified data buffer returned by xt_fps$t used the imgl2$t buffer
    which might be invalidated by subsequent imio activity such as
    impl2$t.  This was found with proto.fixpix.  The routines were modified
    to allocate and use a separate line buffer.  Note that this only
    applies to lines which are modified.  If the requested line does
    not have any bad pixels to fix then the input buffer is still returned.
    (1/29/98, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtfp.gx
    When a segment of bad pixels contains a mixture of column and line
    interpolations and the first pixel is column interpolation then the
    line interpolations could be wrong because interpolation coefficients are
    not initialized.  A second minor fix is that the column interpolation
    endpoints printed in pixel listing mode could be incorrect.
    (1/29/98, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.1
=======

xtools$imtools.x
     XT_MKIMTEMP was modified to append the same extension as the input
     image when creating a temporary image name.  (10/30/97, Valdes)

xtools$ranges.x
     Returned the EOLIST marker to zero since some programs rely on this.
     This means that zero cannot be a range element.  Added some
     checks against a zero step size.  (8/22/97, Valdes)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
     There was a bug in the code which gives "Warning: PLIO: reference out
     of bounds on mask".  This was introduced with the changes to allow
     masks and images to have different binning.  (8/21/97, Valdes)

xtools$ranges.x
xtools$doc/ranges.hlp
    Now allows zero as a valid range element though the default for a
    null string is still 1.  (7/15/97, Valdes)

=========
V2.11Beta
=========

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Improved xt_match to match when the sampling is different.
    (5/21/97, Valdes)

xtools$obsdb.x
    File date was changed but the code was not changed (5/7/97, Valdes)

xtools$dttext.x
    Added the new routine dtgetd to the dttext package. (1/16/97, Davis)

xtools$fixpix/xtpmmap.x
    Fixed some bugs.  (12/30/96, Valdes)

xtools$mkpkg
xtools$fixpix/	+
    Added some new tools for dealing with masks.  (12/6/96, Valdes)

xtools$center1d.x
    When the width parameter is less than or equal to 1 pixel the algorithm
    is supposed to return the nearest local maximum.  There was a bug
    such that the nearest pixel to the starting point was returned
    unless that pixel is a local minimum.  (10/24/96, Valdes)

xtools$numrecipes.x
    Modified the Poisson deviate routine to return zero for input
    values less than or equal to zero.  (10/1/96, Valdes)

xtools$xtimnames.x
    Added "fits" and "fit" as extensions.  (7/30/96, Valdes)

xtools$inlfit/ingresults.gx
    Changed several INDEFR references to INDEF references so that INDEF
    has the correct type (real or double) in the output .x files.
    (18/7/96, Davis)

xtools$dttext.x
    The dtunmap procedure now returns if a null pointer is received.
    (1/6/95, Valdes)

xtools$center1d.x
    Added a routine that allows setting some of the previously hardwired
    parameters.  By default the routines behave as before unless
    c1d_params is called to set the parameters.  (10/2/95, Valdes)

xtools$incopy.gx
    Changed 4 MEMP references to Mem$t references. The in_copyr and
    in_copyd routines are not used anywhere in the system so this should
    not be a problem. (8/2/95, Davis)

xtools$rngranges.x
    Added missing argument to rng_error calls.  (8/2/95, Valdes)

=======
V2.10.4
=======

xtools$obsdb.x
    Changed the "timezone" parameter to be a double instead of an integer.
    There are non-integer timezones such as India.  (12/29/94, Valdes)

xtools$numrecipes.x
    The POIDEV routine can still have a problem in that the tan function
    can return a very large number triggering either an overflow in
    the evaluation of em or in the int truncation of em as addressed
    below.  A test is now made on the value of the tan function.
    (9/14/94, Valdes)

xtools$numrecipes.x
    The POIDEV routine from Numerical Recipes can try to coerce a large
    floating point number to an integer which can cause an exception.
    If the value is 100 or greater a Gaussian deviate is now returned.
    (8/11/93, Valdes)

============
V2.10.3 beta
============

xtools$center1d.x
    For EMISSION features the threshold is applied as an absolute threshold
    if the minimum data value is above zero and as a threshold relative to the
    minimum data value if the minimum data value is below zero.  Without
    this change centering would fail if the data was all below zero.
    (5/5/93, Valdes)

xtools$obsdb.x
    Fixed a couple of typos in comments.  No code changes.  (4/28/93, Valdes)

xtools$rngranges.x
    Yet another ranges package.  This ranges package allows real number
    ranges (including negative values) and @ lists.  It is an object
    oriented package using a pointer.

    RNG_OPEN     -- Open a range string.  Return a pointer to the ranges.
    RNG_CLOSE    -- Close range structure.
    RNG_INDEX    -- Get ith range element.  Return EOF if index is out of range.
    RNG_NEAREST  -- Get nearest range index and value to input value.
		     Return the difference.
    RNG_INRANGER -- Check if real value is within a range.
    RNG_INRANGEI -- Check if integer value is within a range.
    RNG_ELEMENTR -- Check if real value is an element.
    RNG_ELEMENTI -- Check if integer value is an element.
    RNG_ADD      -- Add a range.
    RNG_ERROR    -- Set error flag and free memory.
    (2/16/93, Valdes)

xtools$center1d.x
    If the initial center was more than three pixels from the true center
    the interation would stop prematurely because of the dxcheck criterion.
    Changed dxabs to be the full dx rather than the the limit of 1 pixel
    per interation.  This allows the interation to step as often as
    it needs in one pixel steps until the dx estimate begins to become
    small.  It still preserves the checks for flipping back and forth
    about the center and for a maximum number of times the dxabs
    is greater than the previous minimum dxabs = dxlast.

lib$pkx/dttext.h
pkg$xtools/dttext.x
    Added a new routine, dtremap, which allows keeping the database
    open across multiple calls and remapping when a new database file
    is specified.  It is also optimized when switching back and forth
    between read and append modes.  The data structure was modified
    to record the current database and file names for checking when
    the name changes.  (4/30/92, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/obsdb.x
    1.  Removed obsimcheck procedure.  Did not like the defaulting
	to last set observatory if OBSERVAT not found.
    2.  Added obsimopen procedure.  This is the procedure to call when
	dealing with images.  It returns flags to determine whether a
	new observatory was opened and whether the observatory was
	define by the image header
    3.  Added a verbose obsvopen to allow tracking what the interface is
	doing.
    4.  These changes made in conjunction with changes to the
	astutil.observatory task.
    (2/4/92, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/xtimnames.x +
    Added some tools for dealing with image kernel extensions in image names.
    (1/22/92, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/inlfit/infit.gx
pkg$xtools/inlfit/infitr.x
pkg$xtools/inlfit/infitd.x
    The fit status was not being updated correctly if point were 
    automatically rejected from the fit as opposed to being deleted.
    (1/8/92, Davis)

pkg$numrecipes.x
    Added some fourier routines.  Note that this is still a source only
    entry and is not part of libxtools.  (9/4/91, Valdes for MJF)

pkg$numrecipes.x
    mr = 0.1 * mr --> mr = max (EPSILONR, 0.1 * mr)	(9/2/91, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/inlfit/
    The interactive non-linear least squares fitting package used by PHOTCAL
    was installed in XTOOLS. (8/6/91)

pkg$obsdb.x +
    New observatory database routines.  (11/6/90, Valdes)

====
V2.9
====

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
    In the case that the position correction flipped back and forth about the
    center no center would be found.  In this case I added a check to
    divide the correction factor in half.  (3/13/90, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/numrecipes.x +
    Add some procedures for generating Gaussian and Possion deviates
    as well as an implementation of the Levenberg-Marquardt nonlinear
    chi square minimization algorithm.  These routines are either
    direct implementations from Numerical Recipes or based on descriptions
    in that book. (10/25/89, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/dttext.x
    Commented out the diagnostic message in dtlocate.  (7/19/89, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
pkg$xtools/doc/center1d.hlp
    If the centering width is less than or equal to 1 the nearest minima or
    maxima is found.  As before, a minimum width of 3 is used if
    the width is between 1 and 3.  (7/13/89, Valdes)

===========
Version 2.8
===========

pkg$xtools/logfiles.x
    Added these routines to open and to close a list of logfiles.
    (6/2/89, Seaman)

pkg$xtools/ranges.x
    Fixed a bunch of bugs in the zero handling, the MAX_INT handling and
    that made the step notation flaky.  Made a comma a hard separator
    between two ranges rather than mere whitespace.  (6/2/89, Seaman)

pkg$xtools/xtmksections.x
    A 2D image with second dimension length of 1 is returned without
    an image section from xt_mk1d and xt_mksection.  (1/31/89, Valdes)
 
pkg$xtools/xtsort.x
    Added a double precision version of the three vector sorter, named
    xt_sort3d.  It required a double precision version of xts_compared.
    This change was to support the utilities.curfit task, which now
    sorts its input list data before fitting.  (6/24/88 ShJ)

pkg$xtools/xtsums.x
    When the number of lines or columns is 1 and the line or column is the
    same as a previous call and a data is null then a new vector is not read
    causing uninitialized data to be returned.  Added l1=0 and c1=0 to fix
    problem.  This problem appeared in proto.toonedspec.  (2/12/88 Valdes)

pkg$xtools/mksection.x
    User specified section strings of the form "column 051" are now
    converted to [51,*] instead of [051,*]. (11/9/87 Valdes)

====
V2.5
====

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
pkg$xtools/doc/center1d.hlp
    Valdes, April 2, 1987:
    1.  A bug with testing the right edge of the data was fixed.  This caused
	FPE errors on AOS/IRAF.
    2.  The centering fails if the maximum number of iterations is reached
	or the changes do not continue to decrease within 3 iterations of
	the last minimum change.
    3.  Defined parameters replaced constants used in the code.

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
pkg$xtools/doc/center1d.hlp
    Valdes, March 5, 1987:
    1.  A silent minimum of 3 is imposed on the width parameter.  If there
	is ever a need to allow smaller widths then the procedure can
	be changed and the application relinked.
    2.  The help page was modified to reflect this change.

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
    Valdes, October 29, 1986:
    1.  The first use of threshold was only as a data range limit.
	Now it is used to eliminate all peaks less than threshold from
	the continuum.  This fixes ever finding weak features less
	than threshold.

pkg$xtools/center1d.x
    Valdes, August 18, 1986:
    1.  Added a detection threshold parameter to CENTER1D.

====================================
Version 2.3 Release, August 18, 1986
====================================

cogetr.x: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Error in initializing the procedure cogetr fixed.

icfit$: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  ICFIT package replaced by a new version.

=====================================
STScI Pre-release and SUN 2.3 release
=====================================

icfit$icgfuncs.gx:  Valdes, June 18, 1986
    1.  DCVEVAL was being called in ICGFUNCS with a real argument when
	selecting the nonlinear plot (key 'l').  This caused an error
	on the SUN.  Changed "real" to PIXEL.

gtools$gtwindow.x:  Valdes, June 11, 1986
    1.  Added new procedure gt_window.  It is a cursor driven procedure
	for windowing graphs using the gtools pointer.  The help
	page for gtools was also modified to show the windowing options.

gtools$gtcur.x:  Valdes, May 10, 1986
    1.  Took out "Confirm:" prompt so that cursor input from a file does
	not cause anything to be printed.  Two EOF's (carriage return or
	actual EOF) or a 'q' are required to exit thus protecting the user
	from an inadvertent carriage return.

imt.x:  Valdes April 29, 1986
    1.  Modified the image template package to sort wildcard expansions.

icfit$icgfit.gx,icgfit2.x,icgcolon.x:  Valdes, April 7, 1986
    1.  Fixed use of STRIDX with a character constant to STRIDXS.
    2.  Fixed problem with colon usage for ":sample" and ":function"

xtools:  Valdes, March 24, 1985
    1.  Added XT_PHISTORY to put dated history string.

pkg$xtools/imtools.x:  Valdes, March 18, 1985
    1.  XT_MKIMTEMP modified to create the temporary image header in the
	user current directory with the prefix "tmp".
    2.  XT_DELIMTEMP modified to call IMRENAME instead of RENAME.

From Valdes March 13, 1986:

1.  Added procedure dtgad (database get array double) to dttext tools.
It's purpose is to accomodate double precisions curve fits.

2.  Added COGETR procedures for efficient column access.  A help page
is available.

3.  Added XTSUMS procedures for buffered sums (both column and line).
They are particularly useful for moving sums type of operations.  A help
page is available

4.  Added help pages for COGETR and XTSUMS procedures to help database.
------
From Valdes March 10, 1986:

1.  Added IMTREW rewind procedure to image template tools.

2.  Added IMTGIM procedure to get an image from the template by index number.
------
From Valdes March 5, 1986:

1.  Modified dttext to allow deleting a database.
===========
Release 2.2
===========
From Valdes Feb. 8, 1986:

1.  Modified XT_DELIMTEMP and DEL_IMTEMP to update the pixel header
file so that it correctly points to the header file after the header
file is renamed.
------
From Valdes Jan. 13, 1986:

1.  Changes in DTTEXT.X:
	a.  Size of OS filename in DTMAP1 extended from SZ_FNAME to
	    SZ_PATHNAME + SZ_FNAME.
	b.  Database directories do not allow periods in the names when
	    created.
2.  XTMKSECTION was computing the middle line (or column) as
len / 2 which gave zero for an image of length 1.  Changed to
(len + 1) / 2.
------
From Valdes Dec. 31, 1985:

1.  A bug in imt.x due to incorrect indexing in a string has been fixed.
------
From Valdes Nov. 22, 1985:

1.  A new procedure XT_GIDS has been added to find identifier tokens in a
string and match the identifiers against a dictionary string.  An array
of YES/NO values for each dictionary entry, up to a maximum of maxids,
is returned.  This procedure is useful for parsing an option string.
It is nice because identifiers can be abbreviated and delimiters can be
anything which is not an identifier token (whitespace, commas, colons,
semicolons, etc).
-----
From Valdes Nov. 15, 1985:

1.  Added DTMAP1 to DTTEXT.X text database package.  This procedure
takes a directory name as the database and stores or access text database
files in the directory under the file name key.  It maps the name
"database/key" and calls DTMAP.  This allows better organization of
database information into subfiles of a database rather than one massive
text file.  It calls DTMAP with the database name directly if the database
name is a regular file and not a directory.  Thus, it is backwards
compatible with older single file text databases.

2.  Added ISDIRECTORY.  This procedure tests a virtual file name to see
if it is a directory and returns the os pathname suitable for concatentation.
The function value is the number of characters in the pathname which is
0 for a nondirectory file.
cogetr.x: Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  Error in initializing the procedure cogetr fixed.
