SYNOPSIS

.nf
pointer	im		# IMIO pointer
pointer	co		# COGETR pointer
int	col1, col2	# Column limits of the sum
int	line1, line2	# Line limits
pointer	data		# Data pointer returned

	call xt_lsum (im, col1, col2, line1, line2, data)
	call xt_csum (co, col1, col2, line1, line2, data)
	call xt_lsumb (im, col1, col2, line1, line2, data)
	call xt_csumb (co, col1, col2, line1, line2, data)

DESCRIPTION
The specified lines or columns in a 2D images are summed and a pointer to
the real sum vector is returned.  For \fBxt_lsum\fR and \fBxt_lsumb\fR the
lines between \fIline1\fR and \fIline2\fR are summed and a pointer to the summed
vector between \fIcol1\fR and \fIcol2\fR is returned.  Similarly, for
\fBxt_csum\fR and \fBxt_csumb\fR the columns between \fIcol1\fR and \fIcol2\fR
are summed and a pointer to the summed vector between \fIline1\fR and
\fIline2\fR is returned.  The data pointer is to a real vector.  The column
sums use the efficient column access procedures described in \fBcogetr\fR.

The procedures without the 'b' suffix read the set of lines or columns
in the sum from the image every time.  The 'b' suffix procedures buffer
the lines or columns such that if only a few lines or columns are different
from the preceding sum then only those lines or columns are read.  Thus the
"buffered" sums are used for moving sums while the unbuffered procedures are
used when there is no overlap between the sums.

RETURN VALUE
The returned pointer \fIdata\fR is to a vector of type real.

EXAMPLES
Suppose a sum of "nsum" lines or columns is required through the image
in steps of "nstep".  The following code fragment illustrates the usage.

.nf
	im = immap (image, READ_ONLY, 0)
	switch (axis) {
	case 1:
	    col1 = 1
	    col2 = IM_LEN(im, 1)
	    for i = 1, IM_LEN(im, 2), nstep {
	        if (nstep < nsum)
		    call xt_lsumb (co, col1, col2, i, i+nsum-1, data)
	        else
		    call xt_lsum (co, i, i+nsum-1, line1, line2, data)

	        # Do operations on vector Memr[data]
	    }
	case 2:
	    co = comap (im, maxbuf)

	    line1 = 1
	    line2 = IM_LEN(im, 2)
	    for i = 1, IM_LEN(im, 1), nstep {
	        if (nstep < nsum)
		    call xt_csumb (co, i, i+nsum-1, line1, line2, data)
	        else
		    call xt_csum (co, i, i+nsum-1, line1, line2, data)

	        # Do operations on vector Memr[data]
	    }
	    call counmap (co)
	}
	call imunmap (im)
