pkg$xtools/gtools/gtlabax.x
    Added workaround to avoid GUI message.  (2/1/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtcolon.x
    Corrected definition of btoi.  (8/11/99, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtreset.x
    This routine was declared as a function rather than a subroutine
    as it should be.  (7/21/99, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtlabax.x
    Gmsg call is only made if there is a GUI.  (7/14/99, Valdes)

*
pkg$xtools/gtools/gthelp.x -
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtpage.x -
    New version with access to most of the GIO parameters and with
    GUI messages.  (5/11/99, Valdes)

    Added GTDRAWTITLE, GTDRAWXLABELS, and GTDRAWYLABELS to control the
    three label components as blocks and independent of the user or
    application settings of the title parameters and label parameters.
    The help and key files were updated.
    (4/26/96, Valdes)

V2.10.4p2
=========

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtascale.x
    The case with gt==NULL was not correct.  (8/16/95, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtswind.x
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtcolon.x
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtascale.x
    Two new parameters, GTXFLIP and GTYFLIP, were added.  These boolean
    parameters can be set to flip vectors plotted with the gtools
    functions.  In the gt_window functions flips are now done using
    these new parameters rather than explicitly setting the plot
    limits.  Previously this meant that any use of the flip would
    not allow autoscaling; that is a new graph with different limits
    would only cover the fixed limits.  It also mean that the 'a'
    window function would reset the flip.  (12/8/93, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtplot.x
    The gio color marks are drawn using the G_PLCOLOR rather than G_PMCOLOR
    so the code was change to work appropriately. (11/11/93, Valdes)

    Added color option.  (10/29/92, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtcolon.x
    The :/parameters case was resetting the subtitle string.
    (12/28/90, Valdes, diagnosed by Jeff Munn)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtget.x
    When the sysid option was added the gtgets routine was not modified
    to return the setting.  This has been added.  (7/12/90, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtget.x
    When the histogram type was added the gtgets routine was not modified
    to return this type.  This has been added.  (6/28/90, Valdes)

====
V2.9
====

pkg$xtools/gtools
    1.  Added new colon command :/sysid to turn off system ID banner.
    2.  Added new colon command :/type hist to plot histogram type lines.
    (10/5/89, Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtascale.x
    Made a trivial change, a temp variable is now used for switching two
    variables, to work around an optimizer bug on Sun3/OS4/f68881.
    (9/21/89, Valdes)

====
V2.8
====

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtascale.x +
    Added a procedure to complement GSCALE to scale data only within
    a GTOOLS window.  (11/30/87 Valdes)

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtvplot.x +
    Added a vector version of GT_PLOT.  (11/5/87 Valdes)

====
V2.5
====

pkg$xtools/gtools/*.x
    Valdes, February 17, 1987
    1.  Requires GIO changes.
    2.  Eliminated GT_PAGE, GT_HELP, GT_WAITPAGE.
    3.  Argument change to GT_COLON.

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtset.x
    Valdes, January 30, 1987
    1.  In gtsets if the specified value string is not recognized an
	error message is printed to STDERR.

pkg$xtools/gtools/gthelp.x
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtwindow.x
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtcolon.x
    Valdes, January 13, 1987
    1.  GT_HELP now calls the system PAGEFILE procedure.  This procedure
	should now be obsolete.
    2.	Modified GT_WINDOW and GT_COLON to call PAGEFILE instead of GT_HELP.

gtools$gtwindow.x:  Valdes, June 11, 1986
    1.  Added new procedure gt_window.  It is a cursor driven procedure
	for windowing graphs using the gtools pointer.  The help
	page for gtools was also modified to show the windowing options.

gtools$gtcur.x:  Valdes, May 10, 1986
    1.  Took out "Confirm:" prompt so that cursor input from a file does
	not cause anything to be printed.  Two EOF's (carriage return or
	actual EOF) or a 'q' are required to exit thus protecting the user
	from an inadvertent carriage return.

From Valdes Oct 29, 1985:

Added call to gmftitle in gtlabax.  This insures that graphics written to
a metacode file can use the metacode tools locate graphics.
