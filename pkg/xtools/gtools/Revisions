pkg$xtools/gtools/*.x
    Valdes, February 17, 1987
    1.  Requires GIO changes.
    2.  Eliminated GT_PAGE, GT_HELP, GT_WAITPAGE.
    3.  Argument change to GT_COLON.

pkg$xtools/gtools/gtset.x
    Valdes, January 30, 1987
    1.  In gtsets if the specified value string is not recognized an
	error message is printed to STDERR.

pkg$xtools/gtools/gthelp.x
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtwindow.x
pkg$xtools/gtools/gtcolon.x
    Valdes, January 13, 1987
    1.  GT_HELP now calls the system PAGEFILE procedure.  This procedure
	should now be obsolete.
    2.	Modified GT_WINDOW and GT_COLON to call PAGEFILE instead of GT_HELP.

gtools$gtwindow.x:  Valdes, June 11, 1986
    1.  Added new procedure gt_window.  It is a cursor driven procedure
	for windowing graphs using the gtools pointer.  The help
	page for gtools was also modified to show the windowing options.

gtools$gtcur.x:  Valdes, May 10, 1986
    1.  Took out "Confirm:" prompt so that cursor input from a file does
	not cause anything to be printed.  Two EOF's (carriage return or
	actual EOF) or a 'q' are required to exit thus protecting the user
	from an inadvertent carriage return.

From Valdes Oct 29, 1985:

Added call to gmftitle in gtlabax.  This insures that graphics written to
a metacode file can use the metacode tools locate graphics.
