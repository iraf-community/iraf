mefwrhdr.x
	Previuolsy we changed the value of INHERIT to NO. Now we pass
	the card to the output file unchanged with the exception when
	the output file is new, then we do not pass it along. 3/4/98

mefrdhdr.x
	When a kernel section is given in the input file, it is
	necessary to read the entire header in memory rather
	than the 1st block. An error was found trying to get EXTNAME
	value when the keyword was not located in the 1st block.

mefldhdr.x
	New routine to read the entire header in memory. 10.02.03

==================================================

mefrdhdr.x
	Change mef_rdhdr...() to be a function now rather than a
	procedure. This way we can return and EOF value to the
	calling routine.
	revised. Used mef_ldhdr() now and discard rd1st and rd2end.
	Took out any eprintf statement and made the code much simpler.
