NAME
wfits -- convert IRAF image files to FITS image files
.ih
USAGE
wfits iraf_files fits_files
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls iraf_files
String parameter specifying the input file(s), e.g. "file1" or "file*".
.le
.ls fits_files
String parameter specifying the output destination.
Magnetic tape output is assumed if the first two characters of fits_files
are "mt", otherwise the output destination defaults to disk.
Tape output will begin at the file
number specified in fits_files, e.g. file 5 if fits_files =
"mtb1600[5]". Data in file 5 and succeeding files will be overwritten.
If no tape file number is specified in fits_files, the newtape parameter
is requested. Tape output will begin at BOT (beginning of tape) if
newtape = yes, otherwise at EOT (after the double EOF).
In the case of disk output fits_files may be either a file name template
or a root filename. In the former case there must be an output fits file
name for every image. In the latter case the image sequence number is
appended to fits_files if the number of input images > 1.
.le
.ls newtape
Boolean parameter specifying whether an output tape is blank or contains
data. Newtape is requested only if no tape file number is specified in
fits_files, e.g. fits_files = "mtb1600".
.le
.ls bscale
The FITS bscale parameter, defined as p = i * bscale + bzero, where
p and i are the physical and tape data values respectively.
The bscale parameters is only requested if the scale switch is set
and the autoscale switch is turned off.
.le
.ls bzero
The FITS bzero parameter (see bscale for a definition).
Bzero is only requested if the scale switch is set and the autoscale
switch is turned off.
.le
.ls make_image = yes
By default wfits writes the FITS image(s) to the output destination.
If the make_image switch is turned off, wfits prints the FITS headers
on the standard output and no output file is created. In this way the
FITS headers can be examined before actually writing a FITS tape.
.le
.ls long_header = no
If this switch is set the full FITS header will be printed on the standard
output for each IRAF image converted.
.le
.ls short_header = yes
If this switch is set only a short header, listing files processed and
their dimensions will be printed on the standard output.
The long_header switch must be turned off.
.le
.ls bitpix = 0
A bitpix of 8, 16, or 32 will produce either an unsigned byte,
twos-complement 16 bit integer, or twos-complement 32 bit integer FITS
image. If bitpix is set to 0 (the default), wfits will choose one of 8,
16 or 32 based on the precision of the IRAF image. If bitpix is -32 or
-64 IEEE real or double precision floating point FITS images are produced.
Although this option can avoid the loss of precision involved with scaling
real data to integers, users should be wary about its use as many
local FITS readers and versions of IRAF earlier than 2.9 do not
support this option.
.le
.ls blocking_factor = 1
The tape blocking factor for FITS. WFITS normally writes 2880 byte records.
If the blocking factor is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, then
\fIblocking_factor\fR * 2880
byte records will be written to a single tape record. The FITS standard
specifies that \fIblocking_factor\fR must be less than or equal to 10.
If \fIblocking_factor\fR > 10 then WFITS will interpret this number as the
actual tape block size in bytes. For example if \fIblocking_factor\fR = 1024
then 1024 byte records will be written to tape. This is a very dangerous
option and has been included to accomodate users with restricted block
size devices such as SUN microcassettes. WFITS will issue a warning message
if it sees an illegal block size before it begins to execute.
.le
.ls scale = yes
If the scale switch is set, the IRAF image will be scaled before output.
Two types of scaling are available. The scaling parameters bscale and
bzero may be entered by the user (autoscale = no), or the program can
calculate the appropriate bscale and bzero factors (autoscale = yes).
If the scale switch is turned off, the IRAF image data is converted
directly to integers of the specified bitpix with possible loss of
precision.
.le
.ls autoscale = yes
If the autoscale switch is set, wfits calculates the appropriate bscale and
bzero  factors
based on the IRAF image data type, and the maximum and minimum
values of the data.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION

IRAF data is read from disk and written to the specified destination,
either disk or magnetic tape. The FITS header may optionally be printed
on the standard output as either a full listing or a short description,
with or without creating an output image file. If a the default value
of bitpix (default = 0) is entered, wfits will select the the appropriate
bitpix value based on the precision of the IRAF data. Otherwise the
user value is used with possible loss of precision. Two data scaling
options are available. In autoscale mode wfits calculates the appropriate
scaling factors based on the maximum and minimum data values in the
IRAF image and the FITS bits per pixel. Alternatively the scaling factors
can be entered directly. If no scaling is requested the IRAF data values
will be converted directly to FITS integers with possible loss of
precision.

EXAMPLES

Convert a series of IRAF image files to FITS image files on a blank
magnetic tape, allowing wfits to select the appropriate bitpix
and scaling parameters.

.nf
	cl> wfits iraf_file* mtb1600[1]
.fi

Convert a series of IRAF image files to FITS image files on disk,
allowing wfits to select the appropriate bitpix and scaling parameters.
In the first case the images specified by the template are written
to fits001, fits002 etc. In the second case the list of input images
specified onr per line in the text file imlist are written to the
files specified one per line in the text file fitslist.

.nf
	cl> wfits iraf_file* fits

	cl> wfits @imlist @fitslist
.fi

Convert an IRAF image file to a 32 bits per pixel FITS file with no
scaling and append to a tape containing data.

.nf
	cl> wfits iraf_file mtb1600[EOT] bi=32 sc-
.fi

Convert an IRAF image to a 16 bit FITS image on disk, specifying
bscale and bzero.

.nf
	cl> wfits iraf_file fits_file bi=16 au- bs=4.0 bz=0.0
.fi

Print the FITS headers on the standard output.

.nf
	cl> wfits iraf_file* ma-
.fi

Create a disk file called headers containing the FITS headers for a set
of IRAF image files.

.nf
	cl> wfits iraf_file* ma- > headers
.fi
Write a FITS tape with 14400 bytes per record (5 2880 FITS records per
tape block).

.nf
	cl> wfits images* mtb[1] block=5
.fi
.ih
BUGS

WFITS does not attempt to recover from write errors. When an error is
detected, WFITS issues an error message and attempts to write a double
EOF at the end of the last good record. In this case the last file on
the tape will be a partial file. IF WFITS is not successful in writing
the double EOF, the message "Cannot close magtape file (name)" will be
issued. Problems occur as some drives permit the double EOF to be
written after the physical end of tape and some do not. Similarly
some drives can read a double EOF after end of tape and some cannot. Depending
on operating system and device driver, an attempt to read or write past
end of tape may or may not be distinguishable from a normal write error.

Blank pixel values are not correctly handled.
