NAME
rtextimage -- convert a text file to an IRAF image
.ih
USAGE
rtextimage input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
A list of text files containing image pixels and optional header.  Most likely
the output from \fIrcardimage\fR, see examples below.
.le
.ls output
The output IRAF image name.  If more than one text file is being
read, the ordinal of the text file in \fBinput\fR 
is appended to \fIoutput\fR to generate a unique image name.
.le
.ls otype = ""
The data type of the output IRAF image pixels.  If the IRAFTYPE keyword
is found in the FITS header, it will supply a default value for \fBotype\fR.
Otherwise, the user wil be queried.
.le
.ls header = yes
If \fBheader\fR = yes, \fIrtextimage\fR will attempt to read a FITS
header at the beginning of each text file.  
.le
.ls nskip = 0
The number of lines to skip before reading pixels.  This is used to
skip over a non-standard header and is important only when \fBheader\fR = no.  
.le
.ls dim = ""
A string listing the dimension of each axis.  The number of dimensions listed
equals the number of image dimensions.  This information must be entered unless
it can be read from a FITS header.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Text files are converted to IRAF images files with procedure \fBrtextimage\fR.  
The text file consists of an optional header followed by the pixel
values.  The pixels are read in FITS order, that is, the leftmost subscript 
varies most rapidly.  The number of image dimensions and the length of each 
dimension must either be read from a FITS header or supplied by the user.
Internally, \fBrtextimage\fR determines the format (integer or floating
point) of the pixels in the text file by reading the first one and assuming 
all others are the same.
.ih
EXAMPLES
.nf
Read a file written by \fIwtextimage\fR from the magtape file "mta[1]" into
the IRAF image "picture".

    cl>  rcard mta[1] | rtext out=picture


Read a series of text files with no headers preceding the pixels.  The 
text files were previously read from tape with task \fBrcardimage\fR. 
The two dimensional images are 512 by 320 pixels, and will be named 
crab001, crab002, crab003, etc.

    cl> rtext text.* crab header- dim=512,320


Read a file with a non-standard header.  The header is 5 cardimages long.

    cl> rcard mta[5] | rtext out=spect.1 head- nskip=5 dim=1024
.fi
.ih
TIME REQUIREMENTS
Task \fIrtextimage\fR requires about 145 cp seconds to write a 512 square
image (integer or real) from a text file.  
.ih
BUGS
The text file being read cannot have lines longer than 161 characters, the
maximum size of a line permitted in IRAF.
