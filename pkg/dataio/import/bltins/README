	This directory contains the source code for the 'builtin' formats 
converted with IMPORT.  Here we implement three formats that require different
levels of processing: the GIF format uses LZW compression and a colormap for
pixel storage and requires the most work, Sun Rasterfiles have various formats
that may require colormap application or RLE decoding, and lastly the X 
Window Dump format that fits the generic binary raster model with the exception
of an 8-bit file with a colormap.
	Because formats are defined in the data base the user is unaware of
any special processing that occurs unless implementing a new format that
requires partivular handling.  In the case of colormap files the example of
XWD can be followed and all that's needed is a routine to read the colormap
from the image.  'Builtin' formats must, however, be declared in the source
import$ipbuiltin.x to route execution to the format-specific code.
