RCARDIMAGE Structure Summary

.ls t_rcardimage
The main procedure reads the control parameters.
The files to be read and converted are calculated from the specified source
and file list. A loop trough the files determines the specific input
and output filenames and calls CARDFILE_TO_TEXTFILE for each conversion.
.ls cardfile_to_textfile
The input and output files are opened. Successive card images are fetched and
converted to text lines by FETCHCARD. If the ENTAB switch is enabled
blanks are replaced by tabs and blanks.
.ls fetchcard
This procedure reads individual card images, optionally joining those
images prefixed by an indentifying continuation string with the previous
card image(s). If trim is enabled white space is removed. Newline and
EOS are added.
.ls card_to_text
Converts a packed card image to a text image. Call the CONVERSION routines
to convert from EBCDIC to ASCII if the ebcdic switch is set.

WCARDIMAGE Structure Summary

.ls t_wcardimage
The main procedure read the control parameters.
The files to be read and converted are calculated from the specified
source and file list. A loop through the files determines the specific
input source names and output filenames and calls TEXTFILE_TO_CARDFILE
for each conversion.
.ls textfile_to_cardfile
The input and output source files are opened. Successive text lines are
read and converted to one or more lines card_length + 1 long by
calls to FETCHLINE.
.ls fetchline
FETCHLINE fetches lines of text and splits them into pieces <=
maxch characters long optionally prefixing the remainders with
an identifying continuation string. If the detab switch is set
tabs in the lines are replaced with blanks.
.ls text_to_card
Converts a text string into a packed card image removing the newline
character if necessary and padding with blanks if required.
Call the conversion routines to convert from ASCII to EBCDIC if the
ebcdic switch is set.

MTEXAMINE Structure Summary
.ls t_mtexamine
T_MTEXAMINE fetches the program parameters and  calculates the
input file list. If dump_records is yes, T_MTEXAMINE
calculates the record list to be dumped, calculates the field length
and number of values which can be printed on a line and checks to see that the
data_type and output_format parameters are permitted types. For each
file in the input list T_MTEXAMINE calls MTEXAMINE.
.ls mtexamine
If dump_records is no, MTEXAMINE prints the record structure of the specified
files on the standard output. Otherwise MTEXAMINE loops through the tape
records until it reaches a record number in the record list
and calls dump to output the record to
the standard output.
.ls bytupkl 
BYTUPKL unpacks unsigned bytes into and integer array, optionally swaps
the bytes, and assembles byte_chunk bytes into a long integer.
.le
.ls dump
DUMP prints the record on the standard output using the specified
output format and data type. If byte_chunk is 1 the output is unsigned.
If byte_chunk is equal to the size in bytes of a long integer, then
the data will be printed as signed. If byte_chunk is greater than one
and less then the length of a long the data will be signed if the
output format is decimal and unsigned otherwise. DUMP calls twos_comp
to do the sign conversion.
.ls sign_convert
SIGN_CONVERT does a twos complement sign conversion if the output format is
decimal and byte_chunk is greater than one and less than the size of a
long integer.
