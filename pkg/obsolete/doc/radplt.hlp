NAME
radplt -- plot a radial profile of a stellar image
.ih
USAGE
radplt input x_init y_init
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
the list of images which contain the star whose profile is to be plotted
.le
.ls x_init
the approximate column coordinate as a starting point for the centering
.le
.ls y_init
the approximate line (row) coordinate as a starting point for the centering
.le
.ls cboxsize = 5
the size of the extraction box to be used during the centering process
.le
.ls rboxsize = 21
the size of the extraction box to be used for the radial profile. The
profile will extend to sqrt(2) * rboxsize / 2. This is the length
of the diagonal from the box center to a corner, and corresponds to about
14 pixels for the default value.

DESCRIPTION
Given the approximate coordinates of the center of a star, (x_init, y_init),
RADPLT will compute a more accurate center using the algorithms described in
the Kitt Peak publication "Stellar Magnitudes from Digital Images" under
the Mountain Photometry Code section and then plot the intensity values
in the profile extraction box as a function of distance from the center.
This is effectively a radial profile.

The values for both box sizes should be odd.

EXAMPLES
The following example plots the profile of a star near (123, 234):
.sp 1
.nj
.nf
cl> radplt m92red 123 234
.fi
.ju
.ih
BUGS
The routine will probably fail if the desired star is within 2 or 3 pixels
of the image boundary.
