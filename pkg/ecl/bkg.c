/*
 * BKG -- All the functions relating to background ("&" asychronous) jobs.
 *
 * Here's how it works: yyparse() compiles code into the stack in the usual
 * way, incrementing pc as it goes.  If an '&' is seen, a snapshot of the
 * dictionary, the stack, and all related pointers is written to a file
 * immediately.  The new code is discarded (by putting the pc back where it was)
 * and yyparse() is called again.  See the forever() loop in main.
 * When started as a background cl, the snapshot file is read in and main
 * jumps immediately to run() as though yyparse() had just finished compiling.
 * Thus, background code is compiled in the parent but sent to the child cl
 * to be executed. The t_flags T_BATCH bit is set in the new cl's currentask
 * as well as firstask.  The former is used by bkg_abort() to abort
 * grandchildren.
 *
 *		 bkg_init ()			setup bkg job
 *		bkg_spawn (cmd)			spawn bkg job
 *		 bkg_wait (job)			wait for termination
 *		 bkg_kill (job)			kill bkg job
 *	    bkg_jobstatus (fp, job)		print job status
 *   bool = bkg_jobactive (job)			job is active
 *	       bkg_update (pmsg)		update bkg job status
 *
 *	      bkg_startup ()			called in bkg job to startup
 *	        bkg_abort ()			called by bkg job on interrupt
 *
 * Job numbers start at 1 and count up to the maximum number of bkg jobs
 * permitted.  In all of the above commands, the function will be performed
 * for a single job if job>0.  If job=0 the function is applied to all jobs.
