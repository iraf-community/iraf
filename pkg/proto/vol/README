The VOLumes package is a possibly temporary collection of tasks related to
manipulating and viewing 3d or in some cases 4d "volume" images, and a few
other things.

IMJOIN joins sets of N-dimensional images together along a specified axis.
IM3DTRAN performs 3d image transposes; if appropriate [*,-*,*] type image
sections are given as input, it also accomplishes rotates.  Tasks such as
these may later be integrated into a standard IRAF package.

PVOL projects through volume images, casting rays onto a set of output
2d images distributed along a great circle around the volume image.  When
the output images are displayed or recorded onto video and played back,
the volume image appears to rotate.  Various translucency and opacity 
algorithms are employed.

I2SUN is a temporary task for converting IRAF images into Sun rasterfiles,
primarily to take advantage of a Sun-specific MOVIE utility for viewing
digital movies on a workstation screen; it will no longer be necessary when 
the IRAF image display servers can display movies.

# Not currently distributed:
#VIDRECORD is an NOAO-specific IRAF script that is used to display successive
#images from template or datacube on a display device connected to a recorder.
#The recorder is assumed to be connected via rs-232 to a port on some IRAF node.
#Other sites may wish to modify the associated host-level task that sends the
#device-control commands to the rs-232 port.
