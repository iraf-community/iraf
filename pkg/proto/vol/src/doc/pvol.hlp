Initial projection angle for rotation sequence by \fBdegrees\fR increments.
Measured counterclockwise from +x axis when looking back toward the image
origin.

3 = sum of voxel intensities.
4 = proportional distance weighting: voxel intensity
along projection column weighted by (curvoxel / voxels_in_column)
**\fBdispower\fR.
5 = mod(n):  same as proportional distance weighting, but use only voxel values
which match mod(normalized_voxel * 100) = \fBmodn\fR.

Input voxel intensity ranges within which to apply intensity transformation.
Defaults to input image min and max if not specified (see comments below).
.le
.ls omin, omax = INDEF
Input voxel opacity ranges within which to apply opacity transformation.
Defaults to input image min and max if not specified (see comments below).
.le
.ls amin, amax = 0.0, 1.0
Attenuation factor minimum and maximum for ptype=1 (opacity).  Voxel values
<= omin map to attenuation factor amin, >= omax map to attenuation amax.
.le
.ls izero = 1.0
Initial background iillumination intensity when \fBptype\fR = 1 (opacity).
This intensity will be attenuated consecutively by (transformed voxel_value *
\fBoscale\fR)
along the projection column toward the projection plane.
.le

Voxel opacity scale factor.  Multiplied by voxel value before attenuating
remaining light along projection column for \fBptype\fR = 1.
.le
.ls opacelem = 1
Opacity element in 4th dimension of input image.  When input image is 4d,

.le
.ls discutoff = no
When distance weighting, measure the distance within that set of projecting
voxels that lies between the intensity cutoffs rather than from
the edges of the datacube.  Usually results in faster run times and is
appropriate when the interior of a well-defined object is of interest
rather than its placement inside the datacube.
.le
.ls modn = 10
For ptype=5, only voxel values satisfying mod (int (voxval * 100.0)) =
\fBmodn\fR will be proportional distance-weighted and summed into

.le
.ls maxws = 2000000
Maximum workingset size in chars (usually 2 bytes).  Decrease if machine
performance degrades noticeably during a run.  Increase if the machine has
lots of memory and PVOL does not affect other processes.
.le
.ls abs = no
If yes, take absolute value of voxel before applying any transformation.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Report memory usage, progress around the rotation, and more detail on
errors if yes.

DESCRIPTION

PVOL is used for visualizing the interiors of three-dimensional images.
Opacity and intensity information is used to construct projected 2d images
approximating an "xray" view through the original "solid", with varying
amounts of apparent translucency.  Playing the resulting 2d images back
rapidly as a filmloop generates the impression of a rotating translucent
datacube inside of which you can view much of the original information with
the illusion of seeing it in 3 dimensions.

Given an input datacube plus rotation and projection parameters, PVOL
produces a series of projected 2d images written out as another datacube.
Rotation parameters control the number of frames to project, their
angular separation, and the 3 vectors comprising the axis of rotation.
In the prototype, only one rotation axis is allowed, counterclockwise
about the X-axis when viewed facing the origin from +X (however, the user
is viewing the datacube from -Z, and so sees the datacube rotating toward
him/her).  When off-axis rotations are added, the view angle will still be
from the front of the datacube.
Non-orthogonal rotations in the prototype will have to be accomplished by
first rotating the input datacube appropriately with other tools.

Projection parameters
provide control over the appearance of the projected images.  They may be
tuned to visually enhance the apparent placement of interior regions in three
dimensions during the rotation sequence.  Frames from the output datacube
may be viewed individually on standard image display devices, may be
played back rapidly with filmloop tools, or may be recorded to video as
smooth, rotating volumes.  [At present the only filmloop tool available to us
is MOVIE on Sun workstations, which requires preprocessing the datacube
output from this task with another task called I2SUN].

Sequences where the volume's rotation axis is the same as the viewing or
projection axis are little more useful than a block average of the datacube,
as hidden regions never rotate into view.  Volume rotations about the cube's
X-axis (viewed from the front, or -Z) are the fastest and the only type
implemented in the prototype.

The \fBptype\fR parameter provides control over the type of projection.
There are three main types of projection:  opacity, intensity, and both
together.  If the
input datacube is 4-dimensional, with two elements in the 4th dimension,
both opacity and intensity information will be used -- first the remaining
light along the projection will be attenuated by the opacity function, then
the new voxel's intensity contribution added, according to \fBptype\fR.  Before
the projection function is applied, the raw voxel intensity or opacity is
clipped and scaled by transformation functions under control of task 
parameters.
.PP
The image MIN and MAX must be present in the input image header, or they
will default to 0.0 and 1.0 and a warning will be issued (run IMAGES.MINMAX
with \fBupdate\fR=yes to set them if not already present).
If intensity information is being used, \fBimin\fR and \fBimax\fR
must be specified, or they will default to the image min and max.
First we consider the intensity/opacity transformation functions, then we
discuss how the transformed value contributes to the final projected image.

.nf
	Intensity transformation:

	if (voxval < imin)
	    newval = imin
	else if (imin <= voxval && voxval < imax)
	    newval = im_min + (im_max-im_min) * (voxval-imin)/(imax-imin)
	else
	    newval = imax
	
	Opacity transformation (0.0 <= attenuation <= 1.0):
	if (voxval < omin)	# let maximum amount of light through
	    attenuation = amax
	else if (omin <= voxval && voxval < omax)
	    attenuation = amin + (amax-amin) * (voxval*oscale - omin) /
		(omax-omin)
	else			# let minimum amount of light through
	    attenuation = amin
.fi

The intensity class of projections includes \fBptype\fR = 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.
The default, \fBptype\fR 2, results in the AVERAGE transformed intensity along
the projection column, while type 3 yields the SUM of transformed intensities.

Type 4, PROPORTIONAL DISTANCE WEIGHTING, is used in conjunction with the 
\fBdispower\fR parameter to weight the transformed voxel intensities by
their inverse proportional depth along the projection column.
If \fBdiscutoff\fR is no, the default, the distance will be that portion of
the datacube intersected by the projection ray, measured starting at the
rear (far side from the projection plane).  If \fBdiscutoff\fR is yes,
the distance will be measured between the first and last voxels that fell
between the cutoffs \fBimin\fR and \fBimax\fR.
This projection generates a kind
of depth cueing often useful in determining visually during filmloop playback
which portions of the rotating image are in the foreground and which in the
background (and how far).  The distance weighting is accomplished as follows,
where voxposition and totvoxels are determined according to \fBdiscutoff\fR:

.nf
	\fBptype\fR = 4 (distance weighting):
	newval = newval * (voxposition / voxelsincolumn) ** \fBdispower\fR
.fi

\fBptype\fR = 5, MODULAR PROPORTIONAL DISTANCE WEIGHTING, is useful for better
seeing into the interiors of high-contrast datacubes.  Rather than using each
voxel value along the projection column, only certain voxel values contribute,
based on the \fBmodn\fR parameter (sometimes it is necessary to artificially
"thin out" the data to see far enough into or through it).

.nf
	\fBptype\fR = 5 (modular distance weighting):
	if (mod (int (newval/val_range * 100)) = \fBmodn\fR)
	    use newval as in normal distance weighting
	else
	    ignore newval
.fi

\fBptype\fR = 6 results in only the LAST transformed voxel intensity that
is between the \fBimin\fR and \fBimax\fR cutoffs being used.  This corresponds
to seeing only the outer surface of datacube interior regions between the
cutoffs (though since not every projection ray will pass through voxels
right on the cutoff boundary, this will not necessarily result in a three
dimensional intensity contour of an interior object; i.e. the intensities
of those outer voxels can vary).

OPACITY information can be used in viewing the interiors of 3d images, unlike
in 2d images.  For \fBptype=1\fR parallel rays of light may be pictured
shining through the datacube toward the projection plane, along the normal
to that plane.  The voxel values in this
case are considered to represent a degree of opacity, and a column of light
will be attenuated by each voxel according to a function of its opacity value
as the ray proceeds through the volume.  The \fBizero\fR parameter provides
the initial incident "light" intensity before any attenuation.  The
amount of remaining light after projection through the datacube is very
sensitive to the voxel opacities and the number of voxels in each projection
column.  Consequently, the \fBoscale\fR parameter is supplied to enable
adjusting the relative attenuation in a single step while scouting for
the right opacity transformation function to generate the desired effect
during playback rotation.  Given the amount of attenuation
as determined in the opacity transformation function above, for each 
contributing voxel along the projection column:

.nf
	projection pixel = projection pixel * attenuation
.fi

If the input image is 4-dimensional, with 2 elements in the 4th dimension,
voxel intensities will be added after attenuation 
to contribute to the total projected pixel value (like a cloud
with both absorption and emission).  For
purposes of visualization only, it is not necessary that the voxel value
represent a physically real opacity; any data value may be treated as
attenuating an imaginary xray passing through the solid in order to help
image the volume in three apparent dimensions.

For all of the projection types, once the modified intensity
has been determined, it contributes to the output pixel onto which the
current, arbitrarily-oriented column of voxels projects.  To summarize:

.nf
	1 OPACITY:
	    proj_pix = proj_pix * attenuation
	2 AVERAGE:
	    proj_pix = proj_pix + newval / nvox
	3 SUM:
	    proj_pix = proj_pix + newval
	4 INVDISPOW:
	    proj_pix = proj_pix + newval * (vox/voxincol)**dispow
	5 MOD:
	    if mod (int (newval/val_range * 100.0)) = \fBmodn\fR
		proj_pix = proj_pix + newval * (vox/voxincol)**dispow
	6 LASTONLY:
	    if (\fBimin\fR < newval && newval <= \fBimax\fR)
		proj_pix = newval
.fi

PERFORMANCE AND SIZE CONSTRAINTS

Projections through 3d images inherently require large amounts of memory,
or else the tasks will spend all their time thrashing with I/O.  In volume
rotations about the X-axis, each output pixel is derived by projecting at
an arbitrary angle through a YZ slice of the input image.  Because of otherwise
excessive thrashing, PVOL requires sufficient memory for at least one YZ
slice.  The more YZ slices that will fit into memory at one time, the better,
because I/O is more efficient the larger the chunk of the image that can
be read at one time.  It is best if the entire image will fit into memory,
as the output image (all rotations) will not have to be reread for each
successive chunk of YZ slices.  Available memory is that actually allocable
by PVOL for the slices plus one line of the output image.  On a workstation
there will usually be considerably less memory available for PVOL than
the amount physically in the machine if running in a window environment.
Examples of the number of YZ slices that will fit based on image size and
available memory follow; image datatype is assumed to be REAL -- multiply
number of YZ slices by 2 for SHORT images.

PVOL checks to see how much memory it can grab, then actually allocates
somewhat less than this (otherwise you wouldn't be able to do anything 
except run IRAF tasks already loaded in the process cache until PVOL
finishes).  With \fBverbose\fR on, the task reports memory usage figures.  
On some machines the system will continue to allocate more memory for a
task even above that reported by PVOL.  This can be a problem if you fire
up PVOL from a workstation (even with lots of windows already open);
after you log out, the system may grab that extra memory you were using,
and not even let you back in later.  This is why the \fBmaxws\fR
parameter is supplied -- lower it if this type of behavior is experienced.

EXAMPLES

.nf
1.  Produce 36 rotation projections (one every 10 degrees) around the
    x-axis of a datacube, viewed from the front (negative z
    direction).  Assume that the single-valued input voxel values
    are intensities, and that the image header contains MIN and MAX.

    cl> pvol input output

2.  Generate 180 frames, one every two degrees.

    cl> pvol input output nframes=180 degrees=2

3.  Use inverse proportional distance cubed weighting in two
    subsampled projections for a quick look.  Distance-weight
    only between projection voxels falling within the specified
    cutoffs (0.1 to 1.0).

    cl> pvol input[*:4,*:4,*:4] output nfr=2 deg=90 ptype=4 \
	dispower=3 discutoff+ imin=.1 imax=1.0

4.  Project through a 4d image containing opacity information in
    element 2 of the 4th axis and intensity in element 1.  Scale
    the voxel opacities by 0.1 to allow more light through.  Use
    the SUM of the voxel intensity values (which will be attenuated
    by subsequent opacities), with no distance weighting.

BUGS

Maximizing memory usage without adversely impacting other functions can be
tricky.  Adverse effects may result from using too high a \fBmaxws\fR.

Cannot rotate around arbitrary axis yet.

Lacks shading algorithm.

Needs easier user interface to adjust translucency parameters (e.g. with
mouse when workstations become fast enough to do this in real time).
