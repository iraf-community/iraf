NAME
i2sun -- convert IRAF images to Sun rasterfiles
.ih
USAGE
i2sun input output z1 z2
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Input image template, @file, n-dimensional image, or combination.
.le
.ls output
Root template for output images, e.g. "home$ras/frame.%d".
.le
.ls clutfile
Previously saved Sun rasterfile (e.g. output from IMTOOL), containing the
color/greyscale lookup table information to be passed along to each output
frame.  Standard ones can be saved and used with any number of images (e.g.
"pseudo.ras").
.le
.ls z1 = INDEF, z2 = INDEF
Minimum and maximum pixel/voxel intensities to scale to full output
color/greyscale range.  Both are required parameters, and will apply to all
images in the sequence.
.le
.ls ztrans = "linear"
Intensity transformation on input data (linear|log|none|user).
If "user", you must also specify \fIulutfile\fR.
.le
.ls ulutfile
Name of text file containing the look up table when \fIztrans\fR = user.
The table should contain two columns per line; column 1 contains the
intensity, column 2 the desired greyscale output.
.le
.ls xsize = INDEF, ysize = INDEF
If specified, these will be the dimensions of all output Sun rasterfiles
in pixels.  The default will be the same size as the input images (which
could vary, though this would create a jittery movie).
.le
.ls xmag = 1.0, ymag = 1.0
Another way to specify output rasterfile dimensions.  These are the 
magnification factors to apply to the input image dimensions.
.le
.ls order = 1
Order of the interpolator to be used for spatially interpolating the image.
The current choices are 0 for pixel replication, and 1 for bilinear
interpolation.
.le
.ls sliceaxis = 3
Image axis from which to cut multiple slices when input image dimension is
greater than 2.  Only x-y sections are allowed, so \fIsliceaxis\fR must
be 3 or greater.
.le
.ls swap = no
Swap rasterfile bytes on output?  Used when rasterfiles are being written
to a computer with opposite byte-swapping from that of the home computer
(e.g. between VAX and Sun).
.le

DESCRIPTION

Given a series of IRAF images, an intensity transformation, and a file
containing color/greyscale lookup table information, produces one 2d image
in Sun rasterfile format for each 2D IRAF image.  This is a temporary task
usually used as a step in creating filmloops for playback by a Sun Movie
program.

The input images may be specified as an image template ("zoom*.imh"),
an "@" file ("@movie.list"), or as an n-dimensional image from which to
create multiple 2d rasterfiles.  If any images in a list are nD images,
all 2d sections from the specified \fIsliceaxis\fR will be written out
(default = band or z axis).  At present, only x-y sections may be made,
i.e. the slice axis must be axis 3 or higher.

The minimum and maximum pixel/voxel intensities, z1 and z2, must be specified
as it would be not only inefficient to calculate the full zrange of
each image in a sequence, but would also make very jumpy movies.
Between input intensities z1 and z2, the pixel intensities may be transformed
according to the \fIztrans\fR parameter: "linear", "log10", "none",
or "user".

When \fIztrans\fR = "user", a look up table of intensity values and their
corresponding greyscale levels is read from the file specified by the
\fIulutfile\fR parameter.  From this information, a piecewise linear
look up table containing 4096 discrete values is composed.  The text
format table contains two columns per line; column 1 contains the
intensity, column 2 the desired greyscale output.  The greyscale values
specified by the user must match those available on the output device.
Task \fIshowcap\fR can be used to determine the range of acceptable
greyscale levels.  

A color table file (\fIclutfile\fR) may be produced on a Sun workstation from
IMTOOL (see IMTOOL manual page, R_RASTERFILE parameter and Imcopy function).
This file may be specified to I2SUN as the \fIclutfile\fR parameter.
Likewise, any rasterfiles previously created with
I2SUN may be used as input clutfiles.

The output rasterfile dimensions may be larger or smaller than the input 
images (see parameters \fIxsize\fR and \fIysize\fR, or \fIxmag\fR and
\fIymag\fR).  The parameter \fIorder\fR controls the mode of interpolation;
0=pixel replication, 1=bilinear.

If the output rasterfiles are being sent to a computer with opposite
byte-swapping characteristics, set \fIswap\fR = yes (e.g., when running
I2SUN on a VAX, with output to a Sun).

EXAMPLES

.nf
1.  Produce a series of Sun rasterfiles in tmp$mydir/movie/,
    using a pseudocolor color table file saved earlier, with
    input greylevels scaled between 10 and 100.

    cl> i2sun nzoom*.imh tmp$mydir/movie/frame.%d \
	home$colors/pseudo.ras 10 100

2.  Make a movie through the z, or band, axis of a datacube.

    cl> i2sun cube tmp$cubemovie/frame.%d 1 256 

3.  Make a movie through the 4th, or hyper-axis of a datacube,
    holding image band 10 constant.

    cl> i2sun hypercube[*,*,10,*] tmp$movie/frame.%d 1 256 \
	sliceaxis=4

4.  Run I2SUN on a VAX, with output to a Sun.

    cl> i2sun @imlist sunnode!home$ras/frame.%d 1 256 swap+

TIMINGS
49 seconds (1 sec/frame) to produce 50 100*100 rasterfiles from a
100*100*50 datacube with no magnification, on a diskless Sun-3/110
using NFS to Eagle disks on a lightly loaded Sun-3/160 fileserver
(load factor < 1.5).  
5 minutes for the same with a magnification factor of 2 in both x and y,
bilinear interpolation.
20 minutes for the same with a magnification factor of 5 in both x and y.
