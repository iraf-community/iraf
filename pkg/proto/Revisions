proto.men
    A new task that creates a global, dataless image header from keywords
    which are in common in an input image list and an optional reference
    image.  (2/6/09, Valdes)

masks$t_mimstat.x
    The clipping calculation was resetting the user supplied pixel limits.
    Instead, any clipping limits need to remain bounded by the user
    limits.
    (7/15/08, Valdes)

masks/t_mimstat.x
    When creating an output mask the final mp_invert step doesn't work.  I'm
    not sure if this ever worked right with the PIX_NOT(PIX_SRC) raster op.
    Replaced this routine with yt_pminvert.  (3/14/08, Valdes)

masks/t_mimstat.x
doc/mimstat.hlp
    The "pmmatch" facility now allows the masks to be matched in physical
    and world coordinate systems.  (2/4/08, Valdes)

t_bscale.x
    Fixed a type declaration problem (1/21/08, MJF)

t_fixpix.x
    Changed from using xt_pmmap to yt_pmmap thus supporting world
    coordinate pixel mask matching.  (1/16/08, Valdes)

maskexpr/t_mskexpr.x
    If both a reference image and a reference mask are specified the
    reference mask will be matched to reference image using the features
    of yt_mappm (see xtools$fixpix/ytpmmap.x).  The default is to match
    in "logical" which basically trims or pads the mask.  The power of
    this is that the user may set the environment variable "pmmatch" to
    one of "physical", "world", or "offset".  The physical option is useful
    for taking trims, subsections, or other linear changes into account.
    The world option is useful for matching masks generated from transformed
    images.  One application of this task is now to create the matched
    mask as a file from the internal matching operation by using the
    simple expression "m".
    (1/10/08, Valdes)

V2.12.2a
========

maskexpr/t_mskregions.x
     The code to inherit the size of the reference image was incorrect
     and is now fixed.  (7/8/04, Valdes)

interp.x
     Removed the limit on the size of the table.  The table is initially
     allocated to 4096 pairs, and dynamically reallocated in 4096 chunks
     as needed.  (5/6/04, MJF)

=======
V2.12.2
=======

maskexpr/peregfuncs.x
     Fixed a size decl error in a salloc call in pe_lines() (9/29/03, MJF)

maskexpr/meregfuncs.x
     Fixed an type declaration/usage error for me_is_in_range() (9/29/03, MJF)

maskexpr/peregfuncs.x
    Fixed various min / max data type mismatch problems. (06/19/02, Davis)

masks/t_mimstat.x
masks/rsstats.x
    If nclip > 0 and the initial mean and standard deviation are INDEF (a very
    unlikely occurence unless there is a mask) the ksigma limit computation in
    the mimstatistics / rskysub task could overflow. This does not affect
    released code. (05/01/02, Davis)

maskexpr/gettok.x
    Modified the fetch number token routine to decode decimal number with
    negative exponents correctly. (01/23/02, Davis)

t_suntoiraf.x
    The read routine was being called as a subroutine instead of as a function.
    (01/07/02, Davis)

maskexpr/peregfuncs.x
    Fixed a typo in the salloc call. (01/07/02, Davis)

maskexpr/peregfuncs.x
    Removed argument from the pe_polygon function that was no longer necessary
    and was being used incorrectly.
    (12/14/01, Davis)

masks/mstcache.x
masks/rsscache.x
    Added a call setting IM_BUFFRAC to 0 to the memory caching code in the
    mimstatistics and rskysub tasks in order to force the imio buffer to be
    the size of the input image.

t_imext.x
    The change to use a temp file was not done right.  (1/9/01, Valdes)

t_fixpix.x
    Change to call xt_pmunmap to insure pixel masks memory is released.
    (12/13/00, Valdes)

t_imext.x
    Added logic to recognize an input specifications which has an explict
    extension as a single image.  Previously an infinite loop would
    result.  (9/26/00, Valdes)

t_imext.x
    Instead of expanding into a string buffer the task now uses a temp
    file.  (9/18/00, Valdes)

fields.x
    Added two close statements and a missing sfree statement to the fields
    task to avoid a too many open files error when processing a long list
    of files. (5/19/00, Davis)

=====
V2.11.3
=====

t_bscale.x
    The imio input and output pointers for type double and complex images
    were declared as type double and complex instead of integer causing
    a hangup on sun systems. (12/11/99, Davis)

V2.11BETA
=========

proto$
    The tasks imalign, imcentroid, imfunction, imreplace, wcsedit, and
    wcsreset have been moved to the images package. Imalign and imcentroid
    are in immatch, imfunction and imreplace are in imutil, and wcsedit
    and wcsreset are in imcoords. (3/31, Valdes)

proto$t_wcsedit.x
    The off-diagonal elements of the LTM matrix were being incorrectly edited
    although correctly listed by the wcsedit task, in the sense that editing
    ltm[2,1] was actually editing ltm[1,2]. On the other hand the off-diagonal
    elements of th CD matrxi were being correctly edited, but incorrectly
    displayed. (1/20/97, Valdes)

proto$t_fixpix.x
proto$fixpix.par

    Replace the old version of FIXPIX by a new version that works with
    mask images.  Two new tasks have been added TEXT2MASK and MASK2TEXT that
    convert from the old text file description to mask images and back.
    The MASK2TEXT task is hidden to discourage continued use of the text
    file description.
    (6/14/96, Valdes)

proto$generic/	+
proto$imfunc.x -> generic/
proto$imrep.x -> generic/
    Added a generic directory for generic files.  The imfunc.x
    and imrep.x are now in this directory.  (6/14/96, Valdes)

proto$t_wcsreset.x
    Added an error check to the mw_openim command so wcsreset can erase
    the world coordinate systems of images with wcss that it cannot
    read correctly. (1/8/95, Davis)

proto$t_imcntr.x
    Modified the format of the output to ensure a space between the x: and
    y: and the x and y coordinate and increased the precision of the output
    from %7.3f to %8.3f. (22/4/94, Davis)

proto$t_bscale.x
    Added a call to flush after the status printout so that the output will
    appear after each images is processed. (29/11/93, Davis)

proto$t_imcntr.x
    Modified to imcntr task to use image templates instead of file templates.
    (10/27/92, Davis)

proto$t_imcntr.x
    Added an error check for constant data. (10/26/92, Davis)

proto$doc/suntoiraf.hlp
    Replaced the help page with an updated one. (4/30/92, Davis)

proto$wcsedit
    Added the new task WCSEDIT to the PROTO package. (4/22/92, Davis)

proto$wcsreset
    Added the new task WCSRESET to the PROTO package. (4/21/92, Davis)

proto$intrp.f
    Updated to be the same as in the ONEDSPEC package so that the entry
    statements are removed.  (2/10/92, Valdes)

proto$
proto$suntoiraf
    The LOCAL package task SUNTOIRAF was added to PROTO.  (1/31/92, Davis)

proto$hfix
    The new task HFIX was added to the PROTO package. (1/24/92, Valdes)

proto$*
    1. New PROTO package created from the NOAO.PROTO package.

    2. The IMEDIT, IMEXAMINE, and TVMARK tasks in NOAO.PROTO have been moved
    to the IMAGES.TV package.

    3. The IMTITLE, MKHISTOGRAM, and RADPLT tasks in NOAO.PROTO have been moved
    to the OBSOLETE package. They are superseded by the HEDIT, PHISTOGRAM, and
    PRADPROF tasks respectively.

    4. The BINPAIRS, IRALIGN, IRMATCH1D, IRMATCH2D, IRMOSAIC, NDPREP, and
    SLITPIC tasks have been moved to the new version of NOAO.PROTO called
    NPROTO.

    5. The JOIN task has been renamed JOINLINES.

noao$proto
proto$imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Corrected an error in the column limits computation in the routine
    ie_get_vector that caused occasional glitches in vectors plotted
    using the 'v' key. This bug may also explain occasional unrepeatable
    bus errors which occurred after using the 'v' key. (12/11/91, Davis)

proto$bscale.par
proto$t_bscale.x
proto$mkpkg
proto$doc/bscale.hlp
    Installed a new version of the bscale task. The new task takes a list
    of input images and produces a list of output images like most other
    images tasks. The input images are overwritten if the output list equals
    the input list, and the noact parameter was removed since it is no longer
    required.  Two new parameters upper and lower can be used to remove
    outliers from the statistics computation. The logfile parameter was
    removed and replaced with the verbose parameter. Finally the code was
    modified to only use the step parameter for sampling along a particular
    axis, if no reference is made to that axis in the section parameter.
    (8/26/91 LED)

    (10/25/90, Davis)

proto$imexamine/iesimexam.x
    Add code for checking and warning if data is all constant, all above the
    specified ceiling, or all below the specified floor when making surface
    plots.  (10/3/90, Valdes)

proto$imedit/epmask.x
    Added some protective changes so that if a radius of zero with a circular
    aperture is used then round off will be less likely to cause missing
    the pixel.  (9/23/90, Valdes)

proto$tvmark/tvmark.key
proto$tvmark/mkmark.x
proto$tvmark/doc/tvmark.hlp
    At user request changed the 'd' keystroke command  which marks an object

V2.9

noao$proto
    Davis, June 20, 1990
    The prototype tasks IMSLICE and IMSTACK were removed from the PROTO
    package. Their functionality is duplicated by tasks of the same
    name in the IMAGES package. 

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, June 6, 1990
    The fixpix format input was selecting interpolation across the longer
    dimension instead of the shorter.  This meant that complete columns
    or lines did not work at all.

noao$proto/t_fixpix.x
    Davis, May 29, 1990
    Modified fixpix so that it would work on unsigned short images.

====
V2.8
====

noao$proto/
    Davis, April 6, 1990
    Two new tasks IMALIGN and IMCENTROID written by Rob Seaman were added
    to the proto package. IMCENTROID computes a set of relative shifts
    required to register a set of images. IMALIGN both computes the
    shifts and aligns the images.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 29, 1990
    Even when use_display=no the task was trying to check the image display
    for the name.  This was fixed by adding a check for this flag in the
    relevant if statement.

noao$proto/imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 22, 1990
    The pset was being closed without indicating this in the data structure.
    The clcpset statement was removed.

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 15, 1990
    The EOF condition was being screwed up for two keystroke commands leading
    to a possible infinite loop when using a cursor file input.  The fix
    is to change the "nitems=nitems+clgcur" incrementing to simply
    "nitems=clgcur".

noao$proto/imedit/epbackground.x
noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 9, 1990
    1. The surfit pointer was incorrectly declared as real in ep_bg causing the
    'b' key to do nothing.  This appears to be SPARC dependent.
    2. Fixed some more problems with cursor strings having missing coordinates
    causing floating overflow errors.

noao$proto/iralign.par,ir/t_iralign.x
    Davis, Feb 27, 1990
    Changed the iralign parameter align to alignment for consistency with
    the other tasks.

noao$proto/imexamine/iecolon.x
    Valdes, Feb 16, 1990
    Fixed a mistake in the the datatype of a parg call.

noao$proto/ir/
    Davis, Feb 16, 1990
    Added a feature to the iralign code that permits the user to rerun
    the iralign, irmatch1d, and irmatch2d  using the first runs output
    as input. This permits the user to fine tune the intensity adjustments
    and shifts.

noao$proto/imedit.par
noao$proto/imedit/epcolon.x
noao$proto/imedit/epmask.x
    Valdes, Jan 17, 1990
    1. Fixed typo in prompt string for y background order.
    2. Wrong datatype in clput for order parameters resulting in setting
       the user parameter file value to 0.
    3. Bug fix in epmask.  The following is the correct line:
       line 130:    call amovi (Memi[line], Memi[ptr2+i*EP_NX(ep)], EP_NX(ep))

noao$proto/imedit/epdisplay.x
    Valdes, Jan 7, 1990
    Added initialization to the zoom state.  Without the intialization
    starting IMEDIT without display and then turning display on followed by
    a 'r' would cause an error (very obscure but found in a demo).

    Davis, Dec 12, 1989
    1. Tvmark has been modified to permit deletion as well as addition of
    objects to the coordinate file. Objects to be deleted are marked
    with the cursor and must be within a given tolerance of an
    object in the coordinate list to be deleted.
    2. The help screen no longer comes up in the text window when the task
    is invoked for the sake of uniformity with all other IRAF tasks.
    3. The coordinate file is opened read_only in batch mode. In interactive
    mode a warning message is issued if the user tries to append or delete
    objects from a file which does not have write permission and no action
    is taken.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
noao$proto/imexamine/iegimage.x
    Valdes, Nov 30, 1989
    The default display frame when not using an input list was changed from
    0 to 1.

noao$proto/ir/
    Davis, Nov 28, 1989
    New versions of the proto tasks IRMOSAIC, IRALIGN, IRMATCH1D and
    IRMATCH2D have been installed in the PROTO package. The routine
    have been modularised and now share code in preparation for a
    future database approach to the registration problem. The image i/o
    has been optimized so that all the tasks, but IRMOSAIC in particular,
    will run much faster. A bug in the alignment code in which errors of
    alignment of up to 0.5 pixels can occur has been fixed.
    There is now an option to trim each section before insertion into
    the output image. Finally the actions taken by the task can optionally
    be printed on the terminal.

noao$proto/imeidt/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Oct 30, 1989
    1. There was no check against INDEF cursor coordinates.  Such coordinates
    will occur when reading a previous logfile output and cursor input
    where the shorthand ":command" is used.  The actual error occured when
    attempting to add 0.5 to INDEF.

    Valdes, Aug 17, 1989
    1. Added errchk to main cursor loop to try and prevent loss of the
       user's changes if an error occurs.
    2. If no background points are found an error message is now printed
       instead of aborting.

noao$proto/tvmark/mkbmark.x
    Davis, Aug 4, 1989
    Modified tvmark so that drawing to the frame buffer is more efficient
    in batch mode. This involved removing a number of imflush calls
    which were unnecessarily flushing the output buffer to disk and
    recoding the basic routines which draw concentric circles and rectangles.

noao$proto/imreplace.par
    Valdes, July 20, 1989
    Changed mode of imaginary component value to hidden.

    Valdes, June 13, 1989
    New task IMEXAMINE added to the proto package.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June 6, 1989
    Fixed a bug in tvmark wherein circles were not being drawn if they
    were partially off the image in the x dimension.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June1, 1989
    A labeling capability has been added to tvmark. If the label parameter
    is turned on tvmark will label objects with the string in the third
    column of the coordinate file.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis,  May 25, 1989
    The problem reported by phil wherein TVMARK would go into an infinite
    loop if it encountered a blank line has been fixed.

    Complex images are supported with the thresholds being the magnitude
    of the complex values and the replacement value specified as real
    and imaginary.

noao$proto/tvmark
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task TVMARK was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/imedit/
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task IMEDIT was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/t_binfil.x
    Rooke, Apr 28, 1989
    After allocating temporary storage for header bytes in IRAFIL, the code
    was then reading those bytes instead into pixel storage, resulting in
    a segmentation violation if header > row of pixels (found by Jim
    Klavetter).

noao$proto/epix/epgdata.x
    Valdes, Mar 20, 1989
    Limit checking on the requested data region was wrong.  User would get
    out of bounds message if the line desired was greater than the number
    of columns.
 
noao$proto/t_bscale.x
    Davis, Feb 7, 1989
    Fixed a memory corruption error in bscale. If a user specified a section
    using the section parameter, the task was overflowing the data array
    by trying to read beyond the boundary of the section. 

    Fixed a floating divide by zero problem in the computation of
    step sizes when a specified section was only one pixel
    wide in a given dimension.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Jan 26, 1989
    A "pixel out of bounds" error was fixed in the task IRMATCH2D. This
    would occur if nxsub != nysub and for certain combination of corner
    and order. This bug has been fixed.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Nov 8, 1988
    The two prototype image intensity matching tasks IRMATCH1D and IRMATCH2D
    have been added to the proto package. See the help pages for further
    details.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Jul 23, 1988
    The number of columns and rows between adjacent subrasters in the output
    image produced by IRMOSAIC was incorrect if nxoverlap or nyoverlap were
    less than -1.

noao$proto/t_imslice.x
    Davis, Jul 8, 1988
    A new task imslice has been added to the proto package. IMSLICE reduces
    an n-dimensional image to a list of (n-1)-dimensional images.

    Added the absolute value function.  Combined the different functions
    into one procedure.

noao$proto/t_mkhistogram.x
    Davis, Feb 5, 1988
    A new task mkhistogram has been added to the proto package. Mkhistogram
    will task a stream of data and list or plot the histogram of the data.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Feb 3, 1988
    1. A new parameter "subtract" has been added to the IRMOSAIC task. If
    the "median" parameter is yes then IRMOSAIC will subtract the median
    from each subraster before adding it to the output image mosaic.

noao$proto
    Davis, Dec 8, 1987
    1. Two new tasks IRMOSAIC and IRALIGN have been added to the PROTO
    package. IRMOSAIC takes an ordered list of input images and places them
    on a grid in an output image. Options exist to order the input list
    by row, column or in a raster pattern starting at any of the four
    corners of the output image. Adjacent subrasters may be overlapped or
    separated by a specified number of columns and rows. Positions of objects
    which occur in adjacent subrasters can be marked using for example
    the sun imtool facility and centered using the APPHOT center routine.
    IRALIGN takes the mosaiced image and the coordinate list and produces an
    output image where all the individual subrasters have been aligned with
    respect to some reference subraster.  These two tasks are most useful for
    images which already lie approximately on a grid.

noao$proto/t_bscale.x +
noao$proto/bscale.par +
noao$proto/doc/bscale.hlp +
    Valdes, October 7, 1988
    A new task to compute to scale images by a zero point and scale factor
    has been added.  The zero point and scale factor can be chosen as the
    mean, median, or mode of the images.

noao$proto/doc/replicate.hlp -
    Valdes, June 4, 1987
    1.  Deleted this obsolete file.

noao$proto/toonedspec.x
noao$proto/doc/toonedspec.hlp
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The output spectra are now of type real regardless of the input
	pixel type.  This change was made to avoid fix point exceptions
	on AOS/VS IRAF when summing enough lines to overflow the input
	pixel type.  On the other IRAF systems integer overflows only cause
	erroneous output but no error.

noao$proto/fixline.gx
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The interpolation weights when interpolating across lines were
	being truncated and producing approximately correct values
	but not correct interpolation.  The weights are now not truncated.

noao$proto/join.cl
    Hammond, March 10, 1987
    1. Added script task JOIN, which joins two lists line by line.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
    Valdes, March 3, 1987
    1.  The input images being stacked were not being closed after they
	were added to the output image.

noao$proto/imrep.gx
    Valdes, February 5, 1987
    1.  There was a problem in AOS iraf because of an attempt to convert
	a real INDEF to a short value.  The routine was modified to attempt
	the conversion only if the value is not INDEF.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
noao$proto/doc/imstack.hlp
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
    1.  Modified IMSTACK to use image templates instead of file templates.
	All image tasks should use the image template package for consistency.
    2.  Modified the help page.  One of the examples was incorrect.

noao$proto/imfunction.x
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
    1.  Doug Tody added the square root function.  I don't know the
	details of the revision.

noao$proto/doc/imfunction.hlp
    Valdes, September 9, 1986
    1.  Added the "dex" function which is the inverse of the existing "log"
	function.
    2.  The help page was revised.

proto$toonedspec:  Valdes, June 16, 1986
    1.  Added new task TOONEDSPEC to convert columns or lines of 2D
	spectra to 1D spectra.  A manual page was also added.  This
	is a prototype.  The task or it's function will eventually
	move to the TWODSPEC package.

======================
Package reorganization
======================

local$dsttoiraf:  Valdes, April 7, 1986
    1.  The task resides now on NOAO/VMS SKD:[LOCAL.DAOP]

local$t_imstack.x:  Valdes, April 6, 1986
local$doc/imstack.hlp:  Valdes, April 6, 1986
    1.  Removed warning message about mixed datatypes in IMSTACK.
    2.  Updated help page for IMSTACK.

local$dsttoiraf:  Valdes, April 3, 1986
    1.  Added NOAO foreign task to convert DST (DAO) format images to
	IRAF images.  This task is only available on the NOAO/VMS cluster.
	Attempting to run this on any other system will fail.

local$irafil:  Valdes, April 3, 1986
    1.  George Jacoby added the task IRAFIL to convert integer byte
	pixel data to an IRAF image.  It is an attempt to have a general
	dataio conversion for foreign format images.
