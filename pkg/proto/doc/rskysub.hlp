NAME
rskysub -- sky subtract images using running mean or median
.ih
USAGE
rskysub input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The list of input images to be sky subtracted in time of observation order.
.le
.ls output
The list of output sky subtracted images. The number of output images must
equal the number of input images.  If output is "default", "dir$default", or
"dir$" then for every input image an output image called "dir$image.sub.?"
is created, where "dir$" is the optional directory specification, "image" is
the root input image name, and "?" is the next available version number.
.le
.ls imasks = ""
The optional list of input image masks. The input image masks are assumed to
consist of 0's in good pixel regions and > 0 integer values elsewhere. The
number of input images masks must be 0, 1, or equal to the number of input
images. If imasks is "default", "dir$default", or "dir$" then for every input
image a default input image mask called "dir$image.obm.?" is searched for,
where "dir$" is the optional directory specification, "image" is the root
input image name, and "?" is the highest available version number.
.le
.ls omasks = ""
The optional list of output masks. If output masks are defined they are
used to created the sky image in place of the input masks. The output masks
are a combination of the original input mask and pixels masked during the
input image scale factor computation and consist of 0's in good data regions
and 1's elsewhere. Output masks are only computed if \fIscale\fR = "median".
The number of output masks must be 0 or equal to the number of input images.
If imasks is "default", "dir$default", or "dir$" then for every input image
an output mask image called "dir$image.skm.?" is created, where "dir$" is
the optional directory specification, "image" is the root input image name,
and "?" is the next available version number.
.le
.ls hmasks = ""
The list of output holes masks.  The holes masks defined bad pixels in the
output images, i.e. those for which the underlying sky image was undefined.
Holes masks are created only if \fIhmasks\fR is defined and there is at least
1 undefined sky image pixel in the output image.  Holes masks contain 0's in
undefined sky regions and 1's elsewhere.  If hmasks is "default", "dir$default",
or "dir$" then for every input image an output mask image called
"dir$image.hom.?" is created, where "dir$" is the optional directory
specification, "image" is the root input image name, and "?" is the next
available version number.
.le

.ls rescale = yes
Force recomputation of the individual input image scale factors  even though
they have been previously computed and stored in the keyword \fIskyscale\fR?
.le

are:
.ls none

.le
.ls !<keyword>
The individual scale factors are all set to the value of the input image header
keyword \fIkeyword\fR.
.le

using the input masks \fIimasks\fR, input image section \fIstatsec\fR,
the minimum and maximum good data values \fIlower\fR and \fIupper\R, the
clipping factors \fImaxiter\fR, \fIlnsigrej\fR, and \fIunsigrej\fR and the

DESCRIPTION

RSKYSUB computes the average sky image for each image in the input image
list \fIinlist\fR using a running mean or median technique and subtracts
it from the input image to create the output sky subtracted images
\fIoutlist\fR. The input image list is assumed to be ordered by time of
observation. If the input image masks list \fIimasks\fR is defined then the
input image pixels in the bad pixel regions are removed from the sky statistics
and sky image computation. RSKYSUB optionally creates a list of output pixel
masks \fIomasks\fR and a list of holes masks \fIhmasks\fR.

The input masks \fIimasks\fR can be specified in a variety of ways as
shown below.

.nf
               "" - empty mask, use all the pixels
            EMPTY - empty mask, use all the pixels
         !KEYWORD - use mask specified by  header keyword KEYWORD
        !^KEYWORD - use inverse of mask specified by  header keyword KEYWORD
             mask - use specified mask
            ^mask - use inverse of specified mask
.fi

In all cases the mask values are assumed to be 0 in good data regions and
non-zero in rejected data regions. The input masks may in pixel list, e.g.
".pl" format, or any supported integer image format, e.g. ".imh", ".fits", etc.

The optional output pixel masks \fIomasks\fR are a combination of the
input image masks and the scaling factor computation masks. They consist
entirely of 0's and 1's with 0's defining the good data regions.

The optional output holes masks \fIhmasks\fR which specify those pixels
in the output images which are undefined consist entirely of 1's and 0's
with 0's defining the holes.

Before beginning the sky subtraction step RSKYSUB computes a scaling factor for
each individual input image in \fIinlist\fR and stores it in the input image
header keyword \fIskyscale\fR. If \fIscale\fR is "median" then the median of
the input image pixels is computed using the input image masks \fIimasks\fR,
the good data limits \fIlower\fR and \fIupper\fR, the clipping factors
\fImaxiter\fR, \fIlnsigrej\fR, and \fIunisgrej\fR, and the histogram
resolution parameter \fIbinwidth\fR. The scaling factor is set to 1 / median.
If \fIscale\fR is "none", "!<keyword>", or "@<file>" the individual
scale factors are set to 1, read from the input image header keyword
\fI<keyword>\fR, or from a file \fI@<file>\fR respectively. If \fIrescale\fR is
yes and \fIscale\fR is "median" then the scaling computation is  redone
regardless of whether or not the \fIskyscale\fR keyword is present in the
input image header.

RSKYSUB computes the sky image for each input image by multiplying each
input image by the value of its scaling factor  and then computing the
combination of \fIncombine\fR neighbor images using the algorithm
specified by \fIcombine\fR. If \fIcombine\fR is average then the
\fInlorej\fR and \fInhirej\fR lowest and highest pixels are rejected from
the stack to be combined. For example if the number of input images is 25 and
ncombine is 6 then images 2-4 are used to compute the sky image for image 1,
images 10-12 and 14-16 are used to compute the sky for image 13, and images
22-24 are used to compute the sky image for image 25. There must be a minimum
of \fInmin\fR neighbor images or the sky image will not be computed. If the
input masks are defined then pixels in bad regions are also rejected
from the final sky image computation. Undefined output image pixels,
i.e. those for which the corresponding sky image pixel is undefined, are
assigned the value \fIblank\fR. The sky subtraction processing keyword
\fIskysub\fR is written to the output image when sky subtraction is complete.

If \fIcache\fR is "yes" then RSKYSUB will attempt to buffer the active images
in memory and will run significantly faster. If \fIverbose\fR = yes then
the task prints messages about its actions as it goes along.

are assumed to be stored in the BPM keyword.
