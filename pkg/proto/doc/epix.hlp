NAME
epix -- edit pixels in an image
.ih
USAGE
epix image_name x y new_value
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image_name
Name of image or image section to be edited.
.le
.ls xcoord, ycoord
The coordinates of the pixel to be edited.
.le
.ls new_value
The new value of the pixel.
.le
.ls boxsize = 3
The width of a square subraster surrounding the pixel to be edited over which
the rejection mean and the median will be computed.
.le
.ls ksigma = 0.0
The pixel rejection threshold for the iterative rejection algorithm used
to compute the mean.  If zero, a rejection threshold will be computed based
on the size of the sample using Chauvenet's relation.
.le
.ls edit_image = yes
Set the pixel value to \fInew_value\fR?  If editing is disabled the mean
and median may still be computed, and the subraster may still be printed.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print the values of the pixels in the subraster surrounding the image,
and compute the rejection mean and the median.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A subraster \fIboxsize\fR pixels square is extracted centered on the pixel
(xcoord,ycoord).  If the \fIverbose\fR flag is enabled the values
of the pixels in the subraster are printed on the standard output along with
the rejection mean and median of the subraster.  If \fIedit_image\fR is yes
the program will ask for the \fInew_value\fR and edit the image.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. Replace the specified pixels with a value of zero.
