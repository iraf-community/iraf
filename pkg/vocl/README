CL -- This directory contains the sources for the IRAF command language (CL).
The command language is implemented as a C program upon the IRAF VOS, using an
interface called LIBC (the C runtime library).  LIBC is documented in the
source directory for the LIBC package, sys$libc.  LIBC provides a C language
binding for the IRAF VOS, plus an implementation of the UNIX "stdio" library. 

To compile the CL, the libraries comprising the IRAF VOS must first be compiled
and installed in lib$.  In addition the CL uses LIBC and two graphics
libraries, libstg.a (the STDGRAPH graphics kernel) and libcur.a (cursor mode,
for cursor type CL queries).  A number of global include files are also
required and will be found in host$hlib/libc.  The file <iraf.h> must be
installed in a public directory where it can be found by the C compiler on your
system. 

Given these libraries the CL may be compiled and linked simply by typing
"mkpkg" in this directory.  Typing "mkpkg update" will make the CL and
"install" the executable in the iraf$bin directory.
