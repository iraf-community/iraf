/*
 * PRCACHE -- To minimize spawns, we maintain a cache of processes.  Each
 *   process may contain any number of tasks.  Zero or one tasks may be active
 *   in a process at a given time.  A process is spawned and added to the
 *   cache when a task therein needs to be run.  A process is terminated when
 *   its cache slot is needed by another process or when the cache is flushed.
 *   Error recovery does not normally result in process termination, even when
 *   the error is initiated by a task resident in the process.
 *
 *     pid = pr_connect (process, command, &in,&out, tin,tout,terr, timeit)
 *        pr_disconnect (pid)
 *	        pr_lock (pid)
 *	      pr_unlock (pid)
 *         pr_dumpcache (pid, break_locks)
 *	       pr_chdir (pid, newdir)
 *	      pr_envset (pid, envvar, valuestr)
 *   pid = pr_cachetask (ltname)
 *  pid = pr_pnametopid (pname)
 *         pr_listcache (fp)
 *	    pr_setcache (sz_prcache)
 *      pno = pr_getpno ()
 *        pr_prunecache (pno)
 *
 * The PR_CONNECT procedure executes an ltask resident in an external compiled
 *   process.  A process spawn occurs only if the process is not found in
 *   the cache or is not idle.  PR_DISCONNECT should be called when the ltask
 *   terminates to signal that the process is idle.  Processes may be locked
 *   in the cache, but this facility must be used with great discretion as
 *   it defeats the purpose of the cache and may lead to lockout.
 *
 * A process is passed the environment list and the name of the current working
 *   directory when it is spawned.  New SET environment declarations or chdir
 *   directives may be passed to all processes in the cache without flushing
 *   and refilling the cache, using the PR_CHDIR and PR_ENVSET commands.
 * Pseudofile i/o (xmit and xfer) is handled automatically by the system.
 *   Our function here is to connect the pseudofile streams of the ltask
 *   up to real streams at connect() time, via calls to c_prredir().
 *
 * The size of the cache is a runtime time parameter controlled by the CL
 *   parameter `szprcache'.  The default value of this is set either in
 *   cl$cl.par or in hlib$clpackage.par, hence may vary from site to site
 *   or even from host to host.
