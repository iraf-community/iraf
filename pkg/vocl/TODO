   - start/stop/restart of SAMP sometimes fails with a segfault or
	a pointer free error
   - Need a 'help samp' page
   - implement spectrum load

   - with no Hub running, "samp on" produces duplicate error strings

   - Test file arguments to mtypes (send/receive):
	http URL
	file URL
	local path
	logical path
