                      NOIRLab IRAF v2.18 for MacOS
                         Release:  January 2024


    The IRAF v2.18 release is a product of the Community Science and Data
Center (CSDC) and US National Gemini Office (US-NGO) at NSF's NOIRLab. Its
purpose is to upgrade the IRAF-based Gemini reduction software to provide a
fully supported system capable of running natively on modern hardware. This
work includes

    •   64-bit ports of the GEMINI package and its dependency tasks (primarily
        those from the STSDAS package),
    •   Upgrades to the core IRAF system and all other external packages to
        fix any platform and licensing problems,
    •   The establishment of fully supported Help Desk and distribution systems
        for the IRAF user community.

    The project provides a bridge solution until the new DRAGONS software is
available for all facility instruments and modes, as well as additional
benefits to the wider IRAF community.

    Early results show a 10-20X speedup of reductions using the native 64-bit
software compared to the virtualized 32-bit solutions now in use. Results
are even better on new Apple M1/M2 platforms where the additional overhead of
Intel CPU emulation can be eliminated.

===================
System Requirements
===================

    •    Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2) based Mac
    •    OS X 10.15 (Catalina) or later

   Dependencies
    •    XQuartz must be installed before using the X11IRAF tools or XTerm
         for IRAF graphics display. An XQuartz installer package is included
         in the DMG ‘Extras’ folder.
    •    IRAF must be installed before PyRAF can be run.
    •    IRAF must be launched at least once from the /Applications folder
         before the command-line tools can be used. Similarly, the command-
         ine IRAF or PyRAF commands should be run from a new terminal window
         following installation in the /Applications folder.
    •    Applications cannot be launched from the DMG image.

  Before You Begin
    •    To initialize the user environment setup files and to create the
         links making terminal commands such as ‘cl’ or ‘pyraf’ available,
         either the IRAF or PyRAF application must be launched at least once
         from the /Applications folder or Finder.
    •    Once the applications are installed (and started at least once), the
         familiar commands such as ‘cl’ and ‘mkiraf’ will only be available
         to new shells that pick up the new environment setup. Users have
         the option of:
    ▪    Starting a new terminal window to use these commands rather than use
         existing open windows, or
    ▪    Manually reinitialize an existing shell environment with a command
         such as
                    % source ~/.login
         This will read the $HOME/.iraf/setup.sh script created when the
         /Applications/IRAF.app was first opened.

=================
Quick Start Guide
=================

    To install the applications:
    •    Double-click the downloaded DMG installer to mount it
    •    Drag-and-Drop the application icons into the ‘Applications’ folder
    •    Double-click the IRAF/PyRAF/XGTerm/XImtool icon in the Applications
         folder to start it. 
    •    Starting the IRAF or PyRAF application will initialize your user
         environment to use these tasks from the command-line.
    •    Starting any of the apps will also start Quartz first if necessary. 
         See below for information on configuring the startup preferences.

    To start IRAF/PyRAF from a running terminal window:

    •    Type ‘cl’ or ‘pyraf’ to start the desired command shell. Either
         task may be used from a MacOS Terminal window, however CL graphics
         require that you start from an XGterm or XTerm window.
    •    Starting in this way uses the global login.cl file stored in the
         $HOME/.iraf directory. This may be edited as needed or the ‘mkiraf’
         command can be used to create a new login.cl in the current directory.

    To use the PyRAF Python environment:
    •    The PyRAF application has its own MiniConda installation and does
         not install directly to the system Python environment. As such,
         special commands are required to access and update this environment:

            pyraf           Start the PyRAF command interpreter.
            pyraf_python    Start the Python interpreter used by PyRAF.
            pyraf_pip       Run the PyRAF environment ‘pip’ command to
                            install new packages.

==========
What’s New
==========

    The IRAF v2.18 system is primarily a platform update release and
functionally is the same as the earlier v2.16 systems last released in 2013.
The most significant update is a port of the system to Apple M1/M2 systems
and the upgrade of the GEMINI reduction package.

    For users, the most noticeable change will be improved speed of tasks
using native binaries. GEMINI users will see up to 20X better performance in
reducing data using the native 64-bit binaries.

    For developers, these updates mean that the system will once again build
easily on modern MacOS and Linux platforms.

Support for Gemini Data Reduction
---------------------------------

    The primary driver for this release is the port of the GEMINI data
reduction package to support native 64-bit binaries, greatly speeding up the
time taken for reducing Gemini data that still require IRAF tasks. As part
of this, dependent tasks from the STSDAS and TABLES packages were extracted
to a new ST4GEM external package. Other than minor changes required to use
ST4GEM instead of STSDAS, the GEMINI tasks themselves were not changed.

Availability of some STSDAS tasks
---------------------------------

    The ST4GEM package is exclusively comprised of STSDAS tasks used by the
GEMINI package but could be expanded to include 64-bit ports of other
tasks/packages if needed. While some tasks had equivalents in the core
system, porting the STSDAS task minimized any changes that may have lead to
bugs or changes being introduced in the GEMINI results.

    For users, this package brings back the IGI plotting tool and PSIKERN
postscript graphics kernel as well as other utility tasks for header editing
fitting and image tools.

    For developers, table manipulation and graphics libraries (e.g. stxtools,
gflib/gilib and tbtables) used by some external packages are once again
available.


===============
What’s Included
===============

This installer contains the following software for both Apple and Intel
systems:

    •    IRAF v2.18 — An update of the IRAF core system including a port to
         Apple silicon systems.
    •    26 External Packages —  Updates and new binaries for all publicly
         available external packages, including the 64-bit GEMINI package
         and new ST4GEM support package.
    •    PyRAF v2.2.1 - A self-contained Python 3.8 environment to run the
         PyRAF command shell. A limited number of other astronomy-related
         packages are included, this environment can be extended by the user
         as needed.
    •    XGTerm/XImtool — The X11IRAF tools for graphics and image display.
    
    Additionally,

    •    A ‘Docs’ folder containing PDF copies of all the available IRAF
         cookbooks.
    •    The ‘Extras’ folder contains Gemini tutorials and cookbooks.

===========================
Installing the Applications
===========================

To manually install IRAF or other Applications on a Mac, follow these
instructions: 

    1  Double-click the NOIRLab-IRAF-v2.18.dmg disk image file to mount it
       on the desktop
    2  Double-click the NOIRLab-IRAF-v2.18 volume
    3  Drag and Drop each of the desired application icons to the
       ‘Applications’ folder in the Finder window 

  Note:  If the DMG installer was downloaded using a web browser, you may
         see security popups when installing or launching the applications.
         These can be avoided in several ways:

         1) Once the DMG is downloaded, remove the quarantine attribute
            before opening the image with the following command:

              % xattr -c NOIRLab-IRAF-v2.18.dmg

         2) Download the DMG file using cURL instead of a web browser, e.g.

              % curl -OL https://iraf.noirlab.edu/download/mac/NOIRLab-IRAF-v2.18.dmg


============================
Configuring the Applications
============================

    The applications in this distribution have a limited set of configurable
options to set user preferences. These options are beyond what can be
configured using the standard IRAF or X11 methods. To accomplish this, the
IRAF or PyRAF apps must be executed at least once in order to initialize the
startup environment created in the $HOME/.iraf/initrc file. This file is a
Bourne-shell script used by each of the application startup scripts and can
be used to pass options into the startup process.

    To configure your application environment simply edit the
‘$HOME/.iraf/initrc’ file with your favorite editor and modify any desired
settings. Options that can be changed include:

    cmd_shell        The IRAF command shell to be used. Values may be ‘cl’
                     or ‘pyraf’
    start_dir        The starting directory for an IRAF session. This defaults
                     to the user’s home directory.

    terminal         The graphics terminal to start for an IRAF or PyRAF
                     session. Values may be ‘xterm’ or ‘xgterm’.
    bg_color         Terminal window background color.
    fg_color         Terminal window foreground color.
    nrows            Terminal window number of rows (height).
    ncols            Terminal window number of columns (width).
    font_name        Terminal window font name.

    xim_bg           XImtool window background color
    xim_fg           XImtool window foreground color
    xim_width        XImtool window width (pixels)
    xim_height       XImtool window height (pixels)
    xim_toolbar      Display XImtool ToolBar on open (true | false)
    xim_panelbar     Display XImtool PanelBar on open (true | false)


==============
Known Problems
==============

    Although the core IRAF system and external package have undergone testing,
bugs are always expected in a new release and will be handled in future patch
releases or thru the Help Desk. Bugs found in the earlier v2.16.1 release,
and subsequently by the iraf-community release, have been fixed in this
release as part of the platform upgrade work with the following exceptions:

  1) Background jobs in the CL

    Description: Some recent operating systems use a Position Independent
    Code model that breaks the forking of backgrounds jobs by the CL
    preventing results from being returned properly to the parent CL. Work
    done in the iraf-community release appears to fix this problem, however
    the changes required were still under review at the time of this release.
    Resolution:

    This problem will be fixed in the next patch release.


====================================
License Problem Mitigation Performed
====================================

    The use of Numerical Recipes (NR) algorithms in the original IRAF system
was legitimately raised as a licensing issue for the distribution of IRAF
according to the Numerical Recipes licensing terms. This has been detailed on
the IRAF-Community site at:

       https://iraf-community.github.io/iraf-v216/license-problems.html

    This release addresses each of those files both in the core system and
where they appear in external packages distributed as part of this release.
Specific changes are documented as part of the repository change history and
in numerous ‘Issues’ attached to the repository itself.

In general, Numerical Recipes code changes were addressed in one of the
following ways:

    •    Unused code was removed from the system.
    •    Individual NR procedures were replaced by public domain or properly
         licensed equivalents. This was most often done by adopting the same
         code changes made in the iraf-community v2.17 distribution in order
         to avoid future disputes on proper licenses. In-line code comments
         identify and acknowledge these changes.
    •    Repeated use of a disputed procedure in multiple packages was
         consolidated to a single implementation in a core library where
         possible.
    •    The use of the FFTPACK and LAPACK libraries to provide the needed
         Fourier and Linear Algebra procedures was adopted from the
         iraf-community distribution.
    •    Code derived from the ‘iraf64’ project was re-implemented with a
         faster algorithm, eliminating any problematic code.
    •    The assembly code procedure ‘zsvjmp.s’ was re-implemented from
         scratch for each platform.
    •    All applicable licenses are available from the top-level LICENSES
         directory.

    This work is supported by NOIRLab, which is managed by the Association of
Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA) under a cooperative agreement
with the National Science Foundation. In particular, US NGO staff were
critical in science testing the new GEMINI package to ensure proper results.
We are grateful to our colleagues at Gemini for useful discussions and
internal access to their package test environment.

    This project also benefited greatly from the earlier work’ done by the
‘iraf-community’ (https://iraf-community.guithub.io) project to identify and
fix bugs in the system. Their replacements to the Numerical Recipes code with
open-source equivalents were adopted almost in their entirety in this
release.


==============================
Appendix I:  External Packages
==============================

    The NOIRLab IRAF v2.18 release comes with all available (i.e. public
packages with no outstanding licensing issues) external packages pre-installed.
Individual packages may still be downloaded from the repositories or updated
by users as described in the package README files. Additional packages may be
added in future updates.

    External packages have not been tested as extensively as the core system,
however they have also not been modified as part of this release, just
recompiled. Please contact the help desk with any issues.

=========================================
Appendix II:  XGTerm and XImtool Binaries
=========================================

    The X11IRAF tools, i.e. XGTerm and XImtool, are provided with this
release on as as-is basis. They were built from unaltered sources available
from
        https://github.com/iraf-community/x11iraf

While the Help Desk may be able to provide answers to questions about using
these tools, bug reports (and ideally, fixes) should be reported to the
https://github.com/iraf-community repo as an new Issue on the task.

================================
Appendix III:  PyRAF Environment
================================

    The PyRAF application in this release is based on a Python 3.8 MiniConda
system with a minimal set of other python packages installed that may be
useful for general astronomical scripting.  Environments for both Apple and
Intel systems are included in the PyRAF app but only the binaries appropriate
for the current machine will be used. Installing the IRAF application creates
convenience commands in $HOME/.iraf/bin to allow users to access this
environment. Additional packages may be added to your PyRAF conda system with
the command:
		% pyraf_pip install <pkgname>


The PyPi package for PyRAF used here originates from the repository at

        https://github.com/iraf-community/pyraf

Bug reports for PyRAF errors should be reported as new Issues on that
repository. Usage questions will be forwarded to the appropriate Help Desk as
required.
