FONT Generation Utilities  (August 1997)
----------------------------------------

This directory contains utilities for building font tables for the GIO
system executables.  For reference we include here the font tables for
the standard and greek fonts currently installed in the system:

	font.com		standard text font (Roman)
	greek.com		greek character font
	
These table were built from the Hershey stroke data using the following 
files:

	mkfont.c		task to build font table
	hershey.dat		Hershey stroke data table

Once compiled the MKFONT task can be used to build the table with a command
such as

		% mkfont < romant.txt > font.com

Note that by default the tables are created with a "chr" prefix for the
index, width, and character tables in the .com file.  When building a new
Greek or other symbolic font these should be changed appropriately.
