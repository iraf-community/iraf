C
      SUBROUTINE AGLBLS (ITST,WCWP,HCWP,FLLB,LBIM,FLLN,DBOX,SBOX,RBOX)
C
      DIMENSION FLLB(10,8),FLLN(6,16),DBOX(6,4),SBOX(6,4),RBOX(6)
C
C The routine AGLBLS is used (if ITST .LE. 0) to predict the amount of
C space which will be required for graph labels (excluding the numeric
C labels on the axes, which are handled by AGAXIS) or (if ITST .GT. 0)
C to actually draw the graph labels.
C
C The labels in question are defined by the label list (FLLB array) and
C the line list (FLLN array).  Each label is assumed to lie in one of
C five boxes, as follows:
C
C    Box 1 is to the left of the curve window.
C    Box 2 is to the right of the curve window.
C    Box 3 is below the curve window.
C    Box 4 is above the curve window.
C    Box 5 is the curve window itself.
C    Box 6 is the entire plot (graph) window.
C
C A test run of AGLBLS returns two sets of box dimensions to the caller.
C DBOX contains the dimensions required if all labels are to have their
C desired sizes, SBOX the dimensions required if all labels are to have
C their smallest sizes.  The caller is expected to use this information
C to determine a final set of box dimensions (stored in DBOX), and then
C call AGLBLS again to actually draw the labels in those boxes.
C
C The arguments of AGLBLS are as follows:
C
C -- ITST specifies whether the call is a test call (ITST .LE. 0) or a
C    real call (ITST .GT. 0).  If ABSV(ITST) .GT. 1, AGLBLS is allowed
C    to shrink the labels if they would not otherwise fit in their box.
C    If ABSV(ITST) .EQ. 1, shrinkage of labels is prohibited.  If ITST
C    .EQ. 0, labels are suppressed.
C
C -- WCWP and HCWP are the width and height of the curve window, in
C    plotter-coordinate-system units.  AGLBLS assumes that the last call
C    to the plot package routine "SET" had arguments XLCW, XRCW, YBCW,
C    YTCW, 0., 1., 0., 1., and 1 - defining the most convenient system
C    of coordinates for it.
C
C -- FLLB is the array in which the label list is stored.  The array is
C    doubly-dimensioned.  The first subscript specifies one of ten label
C    attributes, the second a particular label.  The attributes are as
C    follows (the name ILLB(M,N) refers to a label attribute which is
C    intrinsically an integer, despite being stored as a real):
C
C    -- ILLB(1,N) specifies the name of label N.  If ILLB(1,N) is zero,
C       no label is defined.  Otherwise, ILLB(1,N) is an identifier
C       returned by AGSTCH when the name of the label (a character
C       string) was stored away.
C
C    -- ILLB(2,N) may be set non-zero to suppress label N.
C
C    -- FLLB(3,N) and FLLB(4,N) are the x and y coordinates of a base-
C       point relative to which label N is positioned, as fractions of
C       the width and height, respectively, of the curve window.  The
C       position of the base-point determines the box in which label N
C       is considered to lie.
C
C    -- FLLB(5,N) and FLLB(6,N) are small offsets (typically about the
C       size of a character width), stated as fractions of the smaller
C       side of the curve window.  They are used to offset the label
C       base-point (after the box number is determined).  Typically,
C       this provides a minimum spacing between the label and one side
C       of the curve window.
C
C    -- ILLB(7,N) is the orientation angle of the label, in degrees
C       counter-clockwise from horizontal.  The base-line for label N
C       is a vector emanating from the base-point at this angle.  The
C       specified angle must be a multiple of 90 degrees.
C
C    -- ILLB(8,N) is the centering option for the label.  It specifies
C       how each line of the label is to be positioned relative to a
C       line perpendicular to the base-line at the base-point.
C
C       -- If ILLB(8,N) .LT. 0, the left edge of each line lies on
C          the perpendicular.
C
C       -- If ILLB(8,N) .EQ. 0, the center of each line lies on the
C          perpendicular.
C
C       -- If ILLB(8,N) .GT. 0, the right edge of each line lies on
C          the perpendicular.
C
C    -- ILLB(9,N) is the number of lines in label N.
C
C    -- ILLB(10,N) is the second subscript (in the line list) of the
C       first line of label N.
C
C -- LBIM is the maximum number of labels the label list will hold.
C
C -- FLLN is the array in which the line list is stored.  The array is
C    doubly-dimensioned.  The first subscript specifies one of six line
C    attributes, the second a particular line.  The attributes are as
C    follows (the name ILLN(M,N) refers to a line attribute which is
C    intrinsically an integer, despite being stored as a real):
C
C    -- ILLN(1,N) is the position number of line N.  The lines of a
C       label are ordered according to their position numbers, the one
C       having the largest position number being top-most.  Moreover,
C       lines having position numbers .GT. 0 are placed above the label
C       base-line, those having position numbers .EQ. 0 (of which there
C       should be but one) are placed on the label base-line, and those
C       having position numbers .LT. 0 are placed below the label base-
C       line.  The magnitudes of the position numbers have nothing to
C       do with inter-line spacing - that is up to AGLBLS to determine.
C
C    -- ILLN(2,N) may be set non-zero to suppress line N.
C
C    -- FLLN(3,N) is the desired width of characters in the line, as a
C       fraction of the smaller side of the curve window.
C
C    -- ILLN(4,N) is the identifier of the character string comprising
C       the text of the line, as returned by AGSTCH at the time the
C       string was stored.
C
C    -- ILLN(5,N) is the number of characters in the line.
C
C    -- ILLN(6,N) is the index of the next line of the label.  The
C       lines of a label must be ordered by position number (largest
C       to smallest).
C
C -- DBOX and SBOX, dimensioned 6 X 4, contain box dimensions, as dis-
C    cussed above.  D/SBOX(M,N) is the Nth edge-coordinate of box M,
C    where N .EQ. 1 for the left edge, 2 for the right edge, 3 for the
C    bottom edge, and 4 for the top edge, of the box.  The first two are
C    stated as fractions of the width, the second two as fractions of
C    the height, of the curve window.
C
C    RBOX, dimensioned 6, holds reduction factors for the sizes of the
C    characters in labels in each of the six boxes.  Each RBOX(M) is
C
C    -- negative to specify smallest-size characters, or
C
C    -- zero to specify that no reduction factor has been chosen, or
C
C    -- positive, between 0. and 1. (an actual reduction factor).
