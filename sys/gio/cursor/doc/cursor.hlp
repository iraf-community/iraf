Cursor Mode

    In cursor mode, i.e., after a call to \fBclgcur\fR or after typing "=gcur",
a number of special keystrokes shall be recognized for interactive display
control.  All graphics output to stdgraph and stdimage is routed through the
CL on the way to the graphics kernel.  The CL will optionally spool in an
internal buffer all graphics instructions output to an interactive device.
This internal buffer is emptied whenever the device screen is cleared.
In cursor mode, special keystrokes may be used to redraw all or any portion
of the spooled graphics, e.g., one may zoom in on a portion of the plot and
then roam about on the plot at high magnification.  Since the spooled graphics
vectors typically contain more information than can be displayed at normal
magnification, zooming in on a feature may bring out additional detail
(the maximum resolution is 32768 points in either axis).  Increasing the
magnification will increase the precision of the cursor by the same factor.

Cursor mode is implemented by performing coordinate transformation and
clipping on each GKI instruction in the frame buffer, passing the transformed
and clipped instructions on to the graphics kernel.
The cursor mode operations perform a simple geometric transformation on
the spooled graphics frame, mapping a rectangular window of the spooled
frame onto the device screen.  The graphics frame itself is not modified,
hence zoom out or reset and redraw will restore the original display.

If the graphics frame is a typical vector plot with drawn and labeled
axes, magnifying a portion of the plot may cause the axes to be lost.
If this is not what is desired a keystroke is provided to draw and label
the axes of the displayed window.  The axes will be overplotted on the
current display and will not be saved in the frame buffer, hence they
will be lost when the frame is redrawn.  In cursor mode the viewport is
the full display area of the output device, hence the tick mark labels
of the drawn axes will be drawn inside the viewport.  This form of axes
labeling is used because it is simple and because it is appropriate for
both vector graphics and image display output devices (and cursor mode
must serve both).

The cursor mode keystrokes are all upper case letters, reserving lower case
for applications programs.  The terminal shift lock key may be used to
minimize typing.  The recognized cursor mode keystrokes are shown below.

The numeric keypad of the terminal (if it has one) is used for directional
roaming.  The directional significance of the numeric keys for roaming
is obvious if the terminal has a keypad, and is illustrated below.

If the character : is typed while in cursor mode the alpha cursor will appear
at the bottom of the screen, allowing a command line to be entered.  If the
command \fIbegins with a period it is interpreted as a cursor mode command\fR,
otherwise the command is passed as a string to the applications program.
Multiple commands may be entered on a line delimited by semicolons.
The command set currently recognized is shown below.  Minimum match
abbreviations are permitted.

.ls 4
.ls 15 help
Print a list of the cursor mode commands.
.le
.ls case[+-]
Ignore case when interpreting keystrokes.  If this option is selected the cursor
mode keystrokes may conflict with those of the applications program.  
.le
.ls clear
Clear the alpha screen (but not the graphics screen).  This is done by writing
sufficient blank lines to scroll any text off the screen.  Does not work if
terminal has only one memory.
.le
.ls markcur[+-]
Draw a small graphics mark at the position of the cursor whenever the cursor
is read, i.e., when cursor mode exits.  The default is to not mark.
.le
.ls off [keys]
Disable all cursor mode keystrokes except : (colon).  If followed by a list
of keys, e.g., ":.off 0-9IC", only the listed keys are disabled.
.le
.ls on [keys]
Renable all cursor mode keystrokes, or just the listed keystrokes.
.le
.ls page[+-]
Clear the screen when large blocks of text are to be printed, e.g., for '?',
show, and so on.  If paging is disabled the text will overwrite the graphics
display.
.le
.ls read <file>
Load the graphics frame from the named metafile.
The current graphics frame is discarded.
.le
.ls reset
Disconnect any connected graphics kernels and free all file descriptors and
memory used by the graphics system.  Exit cursor mode.
.le
.ls show
Print the values of all cursor mode parameters, show the status of any
connected graphics kernels, summarize memory utilization, etc.
.le
.ls snap [device]
Dispose of the graphics frame to the standard plotter or to the named device.
A magnified graph will be plotted as it appears on the screen.
.le
.ls txset [size] [up]
Set the text drawing parameters (character size and character up vector).
For example, ".tx 2 180" would set the character size to 2.0 and character
up to 180 degrees for a vertical string drawn upwards.
.le
.ls write <file>
Save the graphics frame in (or append to) the named metafile.
If an exclamation is appended to the command (e.g., "w! file") the output
file, if any, will be overwritten.  If a plus sign is appended the entire
frame will be saved regardless of any plot expansion.
.le
.ls xres=N
Set the (soft) device resolution in X.  A decrease in resolution will generally
yield an increase in plotting speed.  Only plots generated on the graphics
terminal are affected.
.le
.ls yres=N
Set the (soft) device resolution in Y.
.le
.ls zero
Equivalent to the numeric key 0, i.e., restore the unitary workstation
transformation and redraw the screen.
.le

For example, to set the X and Y resolutions to 250 and 100, respectively,
one could enter the following command (the computer will type the ':' at
the bottom of the screen when the ':' key is pressed):

	:.xres=250;yres=100

Cursor mode may be initialized at login time by supplying a CL environment
variable named "cminit".  For example,

.nf
	cl> set cminit = off
.fi

would disable cursor mode, and

.nf
	cl> set cminit = "mark;case-;xres=100;yres=50"
.fi

would enable marking, turn off case sensitivity, and set the plotting
resolution to 100x50.  Initialization is performed only once, when cursor
mode is first entered.
