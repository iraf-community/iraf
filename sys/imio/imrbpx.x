# IMRBPX -- Read a line segment from an image with boundary extension.  The
# line segment is broken up into three parts, i.e., left, center, and right.
# The endpoints of each segment, if out of bounds, are mapped back into the
# image using the current boundary extension technique.  The mapped line
# segment in physical coordinates is then extracted; if an image section is
# defined the section transformation has already been performed before we are
# called.  After all three segments have been extracted the entire line
# segment is flipped if the flip flag is set.
