# PRDONE -- Determine if a detached process (background job) has completed.
# This is a difficult process to perform portably at the system call level,
# hence the deletion of the bkgfile is used to signal the completion of a
# detached process.  If the detached process fails to delete its bkgfile
# for some reason, PRCLDPR will do so if the process has indeed terminated.
