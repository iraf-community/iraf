# TTYODES -- Open a TTY terminal descriptor.  If ttyname is "terminal" or
# "printer", get the name of the default terminal or printer from the
# environment.  If the "name" of the terminal is a filename, the first termcap
# entry in the name file is read.  Otherwise, the termcap file is searched for
# an entry corresponding to the named device.
# 
# The descriptor is then allocated, and the termcap entry read in.  Termcap
# permits an entry to be defined in terms of another entry with the "tc"
# field; we must expand such references by rescanning the file once for each
# such reference.  Finally, the termcap entry is indexed for efficient access.
# 
# The form of a termcap entry is one logical line (usually extending over
# several physical lines using newline escapes), consisting of several alternate
# names for the device, followed by a list of ':' delimited capabilities:
# 
# 	name1 '|' name2 [ '|' namen... ] ':' cap ':' [ cap ':' ... ]
# 
# If the final cap in an entry is of the form ":tc=name:", the capability
# is replaced by the capability list of the named entry.
