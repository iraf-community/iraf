# MT_LOCKNAME -- Generate the file name of the magtape lock file, given the
# logical drive name.  We are called from a z-routine, so do not use any high
# level i/o routines.  The generated lockfile name is one of the forms
#
#		dir$mta.lok
# 	or	dir$mta_node.lok
#
# depending upon whether a node prefix is present in the drive name string,
# e.g., whether the drive is local or remote.  Note that the "lock" file is
# always maintained on the current host, even if the drive is remote, because
# the named directory is normally a user directory and may not exist on the
# remote host.
