Introduction

    The mini-WCS interface represents a first cut at the general problem
of representing a linear or nonlinear world coordinate system (WCS).
While some of the harder problems are avoided and the general WCS problem
remains to be solved, the current interface should be largely upwards
compatible with future versions of the interface.  The main items omitted
from this initial version of the interface are support for general nonlinear
world coordinate systems, particularly support for modeling of geometric
distortions and arbitrary application defined coordinate mapping functions.
Limited support is provided for the projective geometries.

Linear Transformations

    Any linear transformation consisting of some combination of a shift,
rotate, axis-flip, scale change, etc. can be expressed as

.ks
.nf
	|x'|   |a b|   |x|   |u|
	|  | = |   | * | | + | |                                   [2.1]
	|y'|   |c d|   |y|   |v|
.fi
.ke

where [x,y] are the input coordinates, [x',y'] are the transformed
coordinates, [a,b,c,d] is a rotation matrix, and [u,v] is a shift vector.

For example, the X term of a combination of a rotation about a point [x0,y0]
plus a shift to an offset [x1,y1] may be expressed as

.ks
.nf
	x' = a(x - x0) + b(y - y0) + x1
	   = ax - ax0 + by - by0 + x1
	   = ax + by + u
.fi
.ke
whence

.nf
	 u = x1 - ax0 - by0
and                                                                [2.2]
	 v = y1 - cx0 - dy0
.fi

Another way of expressing this is to note that [U,V] is the transform
of the origin [x,y]=[0,0] of the original coordinate system.
There is nothing special about the rotation point; a rotation about
any point [x,y] is equivalent to a rotation about the origin followed
by a translation equal to the distance of the rotation point from the origin.

The inverse transformation is given by

.nf
	|x|   |  -1|    / |x'|   |u| \
	| | = | A  | * <  |  | - | |  >                            [2.3]
	|y|   |    |    \ |y'|   |v| /
.fi

where A**(-1) is the inverse of the rotation matrix [a,b,c,d].

.nh 2
World Coordinate Systems

    A world coordinate system (WCS) defines the transformation between
a physical coordinate system (e.g., pixel coordinates in a reference image),
and world coordinates expressed in some arbitrary units.  A two dimensional
WCS can be expressed as

.ks
.nf
	(x',y') = F (l,m, Wx,Wy)
	(l,m) = [CD] * (x-Rx, y-Ry)                                [2.4]

where

	x,y	Are the coordinates of a point in the physical system.
	l,m	Is a linearly transformed representation of the point.
	x',y'	Are the coordinates of the same point in the world system.
	F	Is the WCS function, possibly a nonlinear function.
	Rx,Ry	Define the reference point in the physical system.
	Wx,Wy	Are the world coordinates of the reference point.
	[CD]	Is the coefficient determination (CD) matrix.
.fi
.ke

The notation [CD]*(x,y) denotes a matrix multiply of the CD matrix [CD] and
the vector (x,y), i.e., a linear transformation of the vector (x,y).
If the WCS contains a nonlinear component, as for a sky projection,
this is described by the function F in terms of the intermediate
coordinates (l,m), e.g., the displacement in degrees from the reference
point.  Separation of the WCS into linear and nonlinear components allows
full specification of linear systems using only the basic interface,
and simplifies the representation of the nonlinear part of the WCS.
The nonlinear component itself (F) may be an object of arbitrary complexity.

In the case of a simple 2D linear WCS with no rotation this reduces to

.ks
.nf
	x' = (x - Rx) * CD[1,1] + Wx
	y' = (y - Ry) * CD[2,2] + Wy
.fi
.ke

In the general case the world system may be rotated with respect to the
physical system (original image matrix), hence the WCS must include a
rotation term.  Specifying this as a general linear transformation expressed
as a matrix multiplication allows the representation of such transformations
as conversion between skewed and cartesian coordinates as well as the
more conventional rotation and scale transformation.

The CD matrix representation (developed by STScI and now also associated
with FITS), in addition to allowing specification of a linear transformation,
is responsible for converting between the coordinate units used in the
physical system and those used in the world system (more precisely,
in the general case the units of (l,m) may differ from those of the
world system, since F can also change the units).
It is even possible for the world system to use different units on
different axes, so long as a rotation is not defined between axes with
different units.

For example, if the WCS is used to describe an image cube, following
application of the CD matrix axes 1 and 2 might have units of arc seconds,
and axis 3 frequency.  In this case rotation would be defined only between
axes 1 and 2, i.e., the off-diagonal CD matrix terms CD[1:2,3] and CD[3,1:2]
must be zero, with CD[3,3] giving the scale for axis 3 independently of any
rotation between axes 1 and 2.  This restriction on rotation between
dissimilar axes applies only to the world system described by the CD matrix.
As we shall see in the next section, when the WCS refers to an image,
arbitrary rotations of the raw pixel matrix are still possible by using
a separate pixel space transformation to describe transformations
of the image matrix.

.nh 3
WCS Rotation Between Dissimilar Axes

    To see why rotation between dissimilar axes is disallowed in some
circumstances, note that the CD matrix, since it combines a rotation
(or other pixel space linear transformation) and units conversion in one
operation, can be expressed as follows in the case of a two dimensional system.

The CD matrix is used as follows:

.ks
.nf
	| l |   |    |   | x |
	|   | = | CD | * |   |
	| m |   |    |   | y |
.fi
.ke

The CD matrix is constructed as follows:

.ks
.nf
	|    |   | Dx   0 |   | a  b |
	| CD | = |        | * |      |
	|    |   | 0   Dy |   | c  d |
.fi
.ke

where (Dx,Dy) is the units conversion matrix, and (a,b,c,d) is the
rotation matrix.  This is a completely general representation, i.e.,
any linear transformation may be specified by the matrix (a,b,c,d)
and combined with the units conversion matrix, since the rotation
matrix rotates the physical system to align the axes with those of
the world coordinate system.

The problem comes if we try to \fIrotate the CD matrix\fR.
Although the CD matrix can express any
rotation between the physical and world system, once the CD matrix
has been formed the units conversion and rotation matrices cannot
be recovered.  In general, further rotation of the system described by
the CD matrix requires that we rotate the matrix (a,b,c,d), rather than
the CD matrix itself.  The only exception occurs when Dx=Dy (similar axes),
in which case the CD matrix and rotation matrix are equivalent except
for a constant.  Hence, rotations between dissimilar axes of the system
described by the (already formed) CD matrix are disallowed.  A special
case is rotation is some multiple of 90 degrees, which can be represented
by an axis swap or flip.

.nh 2
MWCS Coordinate System Representation

    The coordinate system representation used by the MWCS interface consists of
two components called the \fBLterm\fR and \fBWterm\fR, specifying independent
logical and world transformations relative to a physical, cartesian coordinate
system.  Three types of coordinate systems are defined, as outlined below.

.ls
.ls PHYSICAL
The physical coordinate system is the raw coordinate system of the data.
In the case of an image, the physical coordinate system refers to the pixel
coordinates of the original data frame.  All other coordinates systems are
defined in terms of the physical system (reference frame).
.le
.ls LOGICAL
The logical coordinate system is defined by the \fILterm\fR in terms of the
physical coordinate system.  In the case of an image, the logical coordinate
system specifies raw pixel coordinates relative to some image section or
derived image, i.e., the coordinates used for image i/o.  In the MWCS the
Lterm specifies a simple linear transformation, in pixel units, between
the original physical image matrix and the current image section.
.le
.ls WORLD
The world coordinate system is defined by the \fIWterm\fR in terms of the
physical coordinate system.  Any number of different kinds of world coordinate
systems are conceivable.  Examples are the tangent (gnonomic) projection,
specifying right ascension and declination relative to the original data
image, or any linear WCS, e.g., a linear dispersion relation for spectral
data.  Multiple world coordinate systems may be simultaneously defined in
terms of the same physical system.
.le
.le

The following observations apply to the behavior of MWCS as applied
to image data.
.ls
.ls 4 1.
Any linear transformation of the image matrix (shift, scale change,
axis flip, etc.) affects only the Lterm.  The revised MWCS for the new
image or image section may be computed merely by doing a linear
transformation of the Lterm.
.le
.ls 4 2.
If multiple world coordinate systems are associated with an image,
all share the same Lterm.
.le
.ls 4 3.
Geometric distortion of an image (not currently supported by MWCS) is
a pixel space operation, i.e. a generalization of the Lterm, hence is
independent of the WCS.
.le
.le

In general, the physical and world coordinate systems are defined whenever
a new image is created, e.g., by a task such as RFITS.  A new-copy type
operation, such as most transformations performed by IMAGES tasks, affects
only the Lterm.

Although we normally speak in terms of images, MWCS is not
limited to applications involving images.  For example, the physical
coordinate system could just as well be a graphics frame buffer, and the
logical coordinate system a pixrect.  A greyscale transformation is
an example of a non-image WCS.  MWCS, or the successor interface,
will eventually be used in GIO, e.g., for cursor readback.

Since the Wterm includes the CD matrix, which defines a linear
transformation, and linear transformations can be combined, in principle
it is possible to combine the Lterm and Wterm to define a single
transformation from logical to world coordinates.  In practice this
can run into problems, as not all pixel space rotations may be
representable by the CD matrix (since the latter may define different
world space units on different axes).  Furthermore, if multiple WCS
are defined, and the WCS are defined in terms of the logical system,
it would be inefficient to have to transform each WCS to the new logical
system each time a linear transformation of the data is performed
(e.g., every time an image is opened with an image section).

For images, the common coordinate transformations are image section (logical)
coordinates to world coordinates and vice versa, and section coordinates
to physical coordinates and vice versa.  The physical coordinate system
can be regarded as a special case of a world coordinate system (the "pixel"
coordinate system) defined relative to logical image section coordinates.

For example, to convert IMIO image coordinates to world coordinates,
the interface will first apply the inverse of the Lterm to determine the
coordinates in the physical system, then apply the Wterm for the desired WCS
to compute the world coordinates.  If the Wterm is linear and the Lterm
does not define any rotations between dissimilar axes, the two operations
can be combined for a more efficient coordinate transformation.

An arbitrary number of world coordinate systems may be defined over the
same domain in the physical coordinate system.  Every WCS has a name
uniquely specifying the WCS type.  A WCS may also have attributes such as
units, axis labels, and numeric output formats specified independently for
each axis, as well as arbitrary user defined WCS attributes.

.nh 3
Lterm Representation

    The Lterm is defined by the terms of a general linear transformation,
as shown in equation [2.1].  For example, in the case of a 2D system the
following quantities must be given to define the Lterm.

.ks
.nf
	[CD] = [a,b,c,d]	rotation matrix
	tv[] = [u,v]		translation vector
.fi
.ke

This defines the transformation between the physical and logical coordinate
systems, i.e., applying the transformation to a pair of physical coordinates
[x,y] yields the corresponding logical coordinates [x',y'].  MWCS will
automatically compute the inverse transformation when asked to convert
between logical coordinates and physical or world coordinates.

.nh 3
Wterm Representation

    The Wterm defines the transformation between the physical system and
some arbitrary world coordinate system.  The Wterm is defined by the
following quantities:

.nf
	R[]		reference coordinates in physical system
	W[]		world coordinates at the reference point
	[CD]		coordinate determination matrix
	wtype		type of WCS (function name string)
	wattr		WCS attributes (string, opaque outside interface)
.fi

The point R, also known as the \fIreference pixel\fR when dealing
with image data, defines the origin of the world coordinate system in
the physical system.  The world coordinates at the reference point are
given by the vector W (at least for a linear WCS; in general the meaning
of the W term depends upon the WCS type).  The CD matrix defines any
rotation between the physical and world systems, as well as the scale
conversion needed to convert between physical and world (or linear world)
coordinates.

Although the function name or type \fIwtype\fR is
accessible to applications, the details of what the WCS means, and how
it is evaluated, are intended to be internal to the interface, hence
the use of strings to pass in the WCS information.  Functions complex
enough to require coefficients should pass the extra information in via
the \fIwattr\fR term.  WCS attributes such as the axis units and labels
are also passed in via \fIwattr\fR.

In the general case there may be any number of different WCS types.
In the case of MWCS, however, only a predefined set of WCS types are
supported, since the code for each WCS is wired into the interface.
The predefined WCS types (as selected by \fIwtype\fR) are the following.

.ks
.nf
	\fIWtype\fR			\fIDescription\fR

	linear			simple linear WCS
	sampled			sampled WCS function
	(TAN etc.)		the sky projections
.fi
.ke

A \fIlinear\fR WCS is specified by the physical and world coordinates of the
reference point, and the row or rows of the CD matrix pertaining to the axes
to which the WCS is assigned.  A linear WCS is completely specified by the
linear term of the standard WCS representation.
  
A \fIsampled\fR WCS is specified by an array of (physical, world) coordinate
pairs, i.e., an array of reference points, sampling the linear WCS function
for that axis.  In the limiting case, for sampled (pixel) data, there is one
(physical, world) point on the WCS curve for each data point.  If the WCS
function is smooth a coarser sampling can be used to approximate the curve,
using some form of interpolation to evaluate the function.  In the MWCS,
a sampled function must be one-dimensional, i.e., associated with a single
axis (higher dimensional surfaces can be represented so long as the axes
are independent).

Note that the sampled function is expressed in terms of the \fIoffset\fR
from the reference point in both the physical and world systems.
Any analytic function, e.g., polynomial or spline, can be sampled and
later reconstructed from the sampled curve with no significant error,
provided the function type and order are known and there are sufficient
sample points to determine the system.
The advantage of the sampled representation is that it is independent of
the function type, and can be used to fit any analytic function when the
time comes to evaluate the curve.

The sky projections are a special case used with astronomical direct images. 
The principal example is the gnomonic projection, the projection of the
celestial sphere onto a plane tangent at the reference point.
The sky projections are completely specified by the reference point and the
standard CD matrix, plus the WCS name which specifies the type of projection,
e.g., "gnomonic", "sine", "arc", and so on.

The WCS attributes which can be set by the \fIwattr\fR string consist of
a number of standard attributes, plus an arbitrary number of additional
WCS specific attributes.  Examples of standard attributes include "system",
"wtype", "units", "label", etc.  A list of the standard WCS attributes is
given in section 3.3.1.

.nh
Interface Overview

    The MWCS interface is a stand-alone interface implementing the linear
and world coordinate transformation abstractions.  While the interface
is designed with the typical application to image data in mind, MWCS is
intended as a general coordinate transformation facility for use with any
type of data, as an embedded interface in other software, including system
interfaces such as IMIO and GIO as well as user applications.

.nh 2
Object Creation and Storage

    The MWCS interface routines used to create or access MWCS objects, or
save and restore MWCS objects in external storage, are summarized below.

.nf
		   mw = mw_open (bufptr|NULL, ndim)
		 mw = mw_openim (im)
		mw = mw_newcopy (mw)
		       mw_close (mw)

			mw_load (mw, bufptr)
		  len = mw_save (mw, bufptr, buflen)
	       mw_[load|save]im (mw, im)
.fi

A new MWCS object, initialized either to a unitary transformation of
dimension \fIndim\fR or to the encoded MWCS in the input buffer,
is created with \fImw_open\fR.  A MWCS object is be
created and initialized from an image with \fImw_openim\fR; if the referenced
image does not currently have any WCS information associated with it,
a unitary pixel WCS will be created.  The \fImw_newcopy\fR operation
creates a new MWCS object as a copy of an existing one, as one might wish
to do prior to modifying a WCS.  When a descriptor is no longer needed it
should be returned with \fImw_close\fR.

A MWCS object (descriptor) is a memory object.  To encode a MWCS in an opaque
machine independent binary array, e.g., for storage in a file or transmission
through a datastream, \fImw_save\fR is called with the \fIchar\fR pointer of
the buffer in which the encoded MWCS is to be placed.  If the buffer pointer is
NULL a buffer will be created and the pointer returned, and if a valid buffer
is passed it will be resized as necessary to store the encoded object.
An encoded MWCS object is reloaded into a descriptor with \fImw_load\fR.
A MWCS may be stored or updated in an image header with \fImw_saveim\fR,
or loaded from the image header into a descriptor with \fImw_loadim\fR.
These are the only interface routines with knowledge of the parameter names,
etc., used to store WCS information in image headers.

.nh 2
Coordinate Transformation Procedures

    The MWCS procedures used to perform coordinate transformations,
and to modify or examine the Lterm and Wterm, are summarized below.

.nf
		 ct = mw_sctran (mw, system1, system2, axes)
	  ndim = mw_gctran[r|d] (ct, ltm, ltv, axtype1, axtype2, maxdim)
		      mw_ctfree (ct)

	    x2 = mw_c1tran[r|d] (ct, x1)
		 mw_v1tran[r|d] (ct, x1, x2, npts)
		 mw_c2tran[r|d] (ct, x1,y1, x2,y2)
		 mw_v2tran[r|d] (ct, x1,y1, x2,y2, npts)
		  mw_ctran[r|d] (ct, p1, p2, ndim)
		  mw_vtran[r|d] (ct, v1, v2, ndim, npts)
.fi

The procedures \fImw_[cv][12]tran[rd]\fR perform coordinate
transformations for individual coordinates or coordinate vectors,
for one or two dimensional systems, for coordinates of type real or double.
The general N dimensional case is handled by the \fImw_[cv]tran[rd]\fR
procedures, which transform \fIndim\fR-dimensional points (\fImw_ctran\fR)
or point vectors (\fImw_vtran\fR).  A single point is specified as a
vector of length \fIndim\fR; a point vector is expressed as an array of
points, i.e., a 2-dimensional array V[I,J], where the index I refers to
the axis within a point vector, and where the index J refers to the point.
The notation V[1,j] references the 1-dimensional point vector for point J.

The direction of the transformation, and the axes for which the transformation
is to be performed, is determined by a prior call to \fImw_sctran\fR,
which specifies the input and output coordinate systems, and performs the
initialization necessary for efficient evaluation of a series of
transformations.  A pointer to the optimized transformation descriptor is
returned, to allow two or more transformations to be prepared and used
simultaneously without having to repeat the setup, which can be considerably
more expensive than coordinate evaluation.  The transformation descriptor
should be freed when no longer needed, else it will be freed automatically
when the MWCS is closed.

A coordinate system is specified to \fImw_sctran\fR by its name.
The following standard systems are predefined.
Additional WCS names may be defined by the application.

.ks
.nf
	"logical"		The logical system
	"physical"		The physical system
	"world"			The default world system
	(user-wcs)		User defined systems
.fi
.ke

Strings are used to specify the coordinate systems in order to allow user
defined and named systems to be added at runtime.
The use of a setup procedure to specify the desired transformation allows
new types of coordinate transformations to be easily added, for example
mixed conversions, as for a 2-dimensional system where the X and Y components
of a coordinate pair belong to different coordinate systems, or computation
of the derivative at a point.  In MWCS, only simple conversions between any
two of the physical, logical, and world coordinate systems are supported.

Specification of the axes for which the coordinate transformation is desired
is necessary for the more complex systems, since there may be different,
often quite independent coordinate systems defined on different axes.
The axes for which the transformation is to be prepared are specified as
a bitmask.  The default, if the mask is zero, is to use axes starting with
1, up to the number required to satisfy the given dimension transformation.

For example, to convert two dimensional image coordinates (section relative)
to world coordinates in the default WCS:

.nf
	call mw_sctran (mw, "logical", "world", 3B)
	call mw_c2tranr (mw, px,py, wx,wy)
.fi

Multiple independent world coordinate systems may be defined relative to
the same physical system.  Most applications, however, are best written
as if there were only one world system, with the coordinate system to be
used being switched about transparently to the application.  For this
reason there is no WCS number argument to the MWCS procedures, and
the "world" system specifies the \fIcurrent default\fR WCS.  If a MWCS object
defines multiple world coordinate systems, a \fImw_ssystem\fR call is used
to select the WCS to be used.  This could be used, for example, to change
the units appearing on plots in a graphics application, transparently
to the application.

.nh 2
Coordinate System Specification

    The MWCS procedures used to enter, modify, or inspect the MWCS
logical and world coordinate transformations are summarized in the figure
below.

The procedures \fImw_[sg]lterm\fR are used to directly enter
or inspect the Lterm, which consists of the linear transformation matrix
\fIltm\fR and the translation vector \fItv\fR, both of dimension \fIndim\fR,
defining the transformation from the physical system to the logical system.
If the logical system undergoes successive linear transformations,
\fImw_translate\fR may be used to translate, rather than replace,
the current Lterm, where the given transformation matrix and translation
vector refer to the relative transformation undergone by the logical system.
This will always work since the Lterm is initialized to the identity matrix
when a new MWCS object is created.  The routines \fImw_rotate\fR,
\fImw_scale\fR, and \fImw_shift\fR provide a convenient front-end to
\fImw_translate\fR for the more common types of translations.

Specification of the Wterm is somewhat more complicated.  The Wterm for
a new WCS should first be created and initialized for a system of the given
dimensionality with \fImw_newsystem\fR.  The linear portion of the Wterm,
i.e., the CD matrix and the coordinates of the reference point
in the physical and world systems, and the WCS dimension, may then be entered
with \fImw_swterm\fR and queried with \fImw_gwterm\fR.

.nf
	     mw_[s|g]lterm[r|d] (mw, ltm, ltv, ndim)
	      mw_translate[r|d] (mw, ltv_1, ltm, ltv_2, ndim)
		      mw_rotate (mw, theta, center, axes)
		       mw_scale (mw, scale, axes)
		       mw_shift (mw, shift, axes)

		   mw_newsystem (mw, system, ndim)
		 mw_[s|g]system (mw, system[, maxch])
		  mw_[s|g]axmap (mw, axno, axval, ndim)
		    mw_bindphys (mw)

	     mw_[s|g]wterm[r|d] (mw, r, w, cd, ndim)
		      mw_swtype (mw, axis, naxes, wtype, wattr)
	     mw_[s|g]wsamp[r|d] (mw, axis, pv, wv, npts)
		 mw_[s|g]wattrs (mw, axis, attribute, valstr[, maxch])
.fi

The world portion of the Wterm is unusual in that the type of WCS may be
specified independently for each axis.  The WCS function type \fIwtype\fR,
and any attributes \fIwattr\fR, are specified for the indicated \fIaxes\fR
with \fImw_swtype\fR.  The axes specified are those required to evaluate
the named function.

In the case of an axis of type "sampled", the sampled WCS function must
also be entered via a call to \fImw_swsamp\fR, and may later be retrieved
with \fImw_gwsamp\fR.  The WCS function is defined as an \fIoffset\fR from
the reference point in both the physical and world systems, e.g.,
the vector \fIWv\fR will be added to the world coordinates
produced by interpolating the sampled function (this can of course be
defeated by setting R or W to zero).

A WCS always has a number of predefined \fIattributes\fR, and may also
have any number of user defined, or WCS specific, attributes.  These are
defined when the WCS is created, in the \fIwattr\fR argument input to
\fImw_swtype\fR, or in a subsequent call to \fImw_swattrs\fR.  The WCS
attributes for a specific axis may be queried with the function
\fImw_gwattrs\fR.  Attribute values may be modified, or new attributes defined,
with \fImw_swattrs\fR.  The issue of WCS attributes is discussed further
in the next section.

.nh 3
WCS Types and Attributes

    The WCS attributes which can be set by the \fIwattr\fR term consist of
a number of standard attributes, plus an arbitrary number of additional
WCS specific (application defined) attributes.  The following standard
attributes are reserved (but not necessarily defined) for each WCS:

.nf
	"units"		axis units ("pixels", etc.)
	"label"		axis label, for plots
	"format"	axis numeric format, for tick labels
	"wtype"		WCS type, e.g., "linear"
.fi

In addition, the following are defined for the entire WCS,
regardless of the axis:

.nf
	"system"	system name (logical, physical, etc.)
	"object"	external object with which WCS is associated
.fi

For example, to determine the WCS type for axis 1:

	call mw_gwattrs (mw, 1, "wtype", wtype, SZ_WTYPE)

The (world coordinate) system name \fIsystem\fR is what is used, e.g.,
to select a WCS in a call to \fImw_ssystem\fR, or define a coordinate
transformation in a call to \fImw_sctran\fR.  Note that the system name
"world" is actually only an alias for the \fIdefault world system\fR.
This may be any primary system, i.e., the logical or physical system,
or a user defined world system.  The initial default world system may
be specified by the user by predefining the environment variable
\fBdefwcs\fR, otherwise the first-defined user world system is used,
else the physical system is used.

If the MWCS is associated with an image then the "object" attribute of
the physical system will return the name of the image or image section
defined as the physical coordinate system for the MWCS.
This is not necessarily the full image, e.g., in the case of
a multidimensional image, the physical system might be any 2D plane of the
image.  In the case of an event file image, the image name may include a
filter or blocking factor.  References back to the raw data image based on
MWCS physical coordinates will work so long as the raw image is opened
using the name returned by the interface.  If the image is already open
and was accessed by descriptor via MWCS, the descriptor may be retrieved
by a \fImw_stati\fR call to fetch MW_IMDES.

All MWCS coordinate systems have the standard attributes, with default values
being supplied by the interface if not set by the application.  In particular,
the logical and physical coordinate systems have attributes and may be
treated as a special case of a world coordinate system by the application.

.nh 3
Axis Mapping

    The coordinate transformation procedures (section 3.2) include support
for a feature called \fIaxis mapping\fR, used to implement \fIdimensional
reduction\fR.  A example of dimensional reduction occurs in IMIO, when
an image section is used to specify a subraster of an image of dimension
less than the full physical image.  For example, the section might specify
a 1 dimensional line or column of a 2 or higher dimensional image, or a
2 dimensional section of a 3 dimensional image.  When this occurs the
applications sees a logical image of dimension equal to that of the image
section, since logically an image section \fIis\fR an image.

Dimensional reduction is implemented in MWCS by a transformation on the
input and output coordinate vectors.  The internal MWCS coordinate system
is unaffected by either dimensional reduction or axis mapping; axis mapping
affects only the view of the WCS as seen by the application using the
coordinate transformation procedures.

For example, if the physical image is an image cube and we access the
logical image section "[*,5,*]", an axis mapping may be set up which
maps \fIphysical\fR axis 1 to logical axis 1, physical axis 2 to the
constant 5, and physical axis 3 to logical axis 2.  The internal system
remains 3 dimensional, but the application sees a 2 dimensional system.
Upon input, the missing axis y=5 is added to the 2 dimensional input
coordinate vectors, producing a 3 dimensional coordinate vector for
internal use.  During output axis 2 is dropped and replaced by axis 3.

The axis map is entered with \fImw_saxmap\fR and queried with \fImw_gaxmap\fR.
Here, \fIaxno\fR is a vector, with \fIaxno[i]\fR specifying the logical axis
to be mapped onto physical axis I.  If zero is specified the constant
\fIaxval[i]\fR is used instead.  Axis mapping may be enabled or disabled
with a call to \fImw_seti\fR.

Axis mapping affects all of the coordinate transformation procedures,
plus \fImw_translate\fR (since it defines a translation in terms of the
logical system), and all of the coordinate system specification procedures
having an "axis" parameter, e.g., \fImw_gwattrs\fR.
Axis mapping is not used with those procedures which directly access or
modify the physical or world systems (e.g., \fImw_slterm\fR or
\fImw_swterm\fR) since full knowledge of the physical system is necessary
for such operations.

.nh 3
Binding the Physical System

    Recall that all coordinate systems are defined in terms of the physical
system, and that the Lterm defines the mapping between the physical system
and the logical system.  Transformations of the logical system leave the
physical and world systems unaffected.  The only exception to this is the
procedure \fImw_bindphys\fR, which binds the physical system to the current
logical system, i.e., makes the current logical system the new physical system.
This involves a transformation of the linear term (CD matrix) of each world
system, since a world system is defined in terms of the physical system,
and initialization of the Lterm to (normally) the identity matrix and zero
translation vector.  This operation is irreversible, i.e., once
\fImw_bindphys\fR is executed the original physical system is lost.

In the case of an MWCS which is associated with an image opened with an image
section, the new physical system is not strictly speaking the logical system,
but the image matrix of the image being accessed, i.e,. the current image
ignoring the image section.  Hence, following a call to \fImw_bindphys\fR,
the Lterm will always describe the translation between the physical image
matrix currently being accessed, and the logical system (image section).

.nh 2
Set/Stat Procedures

    The MWCS status procedures, used to query or set the MWCS parameters,
are as follows.

.nf
			mw_seti (mw, what, ival)
		ival = mw_stati (mw, what)
			mw_show (mw, outfd, what)
.fi

The currently defined interface parameters are the following.

.nf
	   Name       Type          Description

	MW_AXMAP	b	enable or disable axis mapping
	MW_IMDES	i	descriptor of associated image
	MW_INTERP	i	interpolator type for sampled wcs
	MW_NDIM		i	dimensionality of logical system
	MW_NPHYSDIM	i	dimensionality of physical system
	MW_NWCS		i	number of wcs defined
	MW_WCS		i	currently active wcs
.fi

MW_NDIM may differ from MW_NPHYSDIM if dimensional reduction has been
specified and axis mapping is enabled.  MW_NWCS returns the number of
WCS currently defined; at least two WCS are always defined, i.e., the
logical and physical systems (the world system will default to the
physical system if not otherwise defined).  The index of the current
default WCS is given by MW_WCS.  In the case of a sampled WCS, the
interpolator type used by the coordinate transformation procedures is
specified by MW_INTERP.

.nh 2
Utility Routines

    The following routines are used internally within the interface to
compile or evaluate transformations, and may be useful in applications
code as well.

.nf
		 mw_invert[r|d] (o_ltm, n_ltm, ndim)
		   mw_mmul[r|d] (ltm_1, ltm_2, ltm_out, ndim)
		   mw_vmul[r|d] (ltm, ltv_in, ltv_out, ndim)
		    mw_glt[r|d] (v1, v2, ltm, ltv, ndim)
.fi

These routines perform matrix inversion, multiplication of a matrix by another
matrix, multiplication of a vector by a matrix, and general linear
transformation (matrix multiply and addition of translation vector).

.nh 2
Datatypes and Precision

    All floating point data is stored internally in MWCS using double
precision.  Most of the interface procedures have both type real and type
double versions, e.g., for entering Lterm or Wterm data.
The single precision versions should be normally used unless double
precision is required to represent the data.

Although all floating point data is stored internally as type double,
coordinate transformations performed at runtime may be carried out using
either single or double precision computations, depending upon, e.g., whether
\fImw_ctranr\fR or \fImw_ctrand\fR is called to perform the transformation.
What happens is that when the transformation is compiled by \fImw_sctran\fR,
two transformation descriptors are prepared, one for type real and the other
for type double, with the appropriate descriptor being selected at runtime
to carry out the transformation.  Hence the precision appropriate for the
problem at hand can be employed without requiring that the worst case
precision be used for all applications.

IMIO Interface to MWCS
.nh 2
Image Header Representation

    When MWCS is used with image data, the encoded MWCS object is stored
in the image header, and loaded into an MWCS descriptor when the image is
accessed by an applications program.  The format in which the MWCS is
stored in the image header depends upon the type of image.  If the image
has a "flex-header" (as for QPOE and the new image structures) the MWCS
is encoded in a machine independent binary format and stored in the image
header as a variable length byte array.  This provides full generality
and is the most efficient approach.

For the older image formats which use a FITS header (OIF and STF) it is
necessary to encode the MWCS as a series of FITS cards.  The proposed FITS
WCS format, already in use for STF format images (with minor deviations
from the standard), is used to represent the MWCS Wterm.  Additional FITS
cards are necessary to represent the Lterm.  The (P,W) array for sampled
WCS can also be represented in a FITS header, although this is awkward and
inefficient if the number of samples is large.

The FITS header keywords used to represent the Wterm, Lterm, and sampled
WCS are the following.

.nf
	WCSDIM		WCS dimension (may differ from image)

	CTYPEn		coordinate type
	CRPIXn		reference pixel
	CRVALn		world coords of reference pixel
	CDi_j		CD matrix

	CDELTn		CDi_i if CD matrix not used (input only)
	CROTA2		rotation angle if CD matrix not used

	LTVi		Lterm translation vector
	LTMi_j		Lterm rotation matrix

	WSVi_LEN	Number of sample points for axis I
	WSVi_jjj	Sampled WCS array for axis I

	WATi_jjj	WCS attributes for axis I
.fi

Contrary to MWCS convention, the WCS stored in a FITS format header
defines the transformation from the logical system (image matrix)
to the world system, rather than the physical system.  The MWCS Wterm
is computed from the FITS representation by transforming the FITS WCS
by the stored Lterm when the stored MWCS is loaded.

The name format CDi_j varies slightly from the proposed FITS standard, but is
backwards compatible with STF (and more readable than the FITS nomenclature).
The keywords LTVECn, LTi_j, WSVi_LEN, WSVi_jjj, and WATi_jjj are peculiar
to MWCS.  A sampled WCS is represented as a series of WSVi_jjj cards,
wherein the sample points are stored as character strings, storing as
many sample points as possible on each card, ignoring the card boundaries
(i.e., a card may end in the middle of a number).  WCS attributes are likewise
encoded as a series of WATi_jjj cards, giving the attributes for axis I as
string data of the form "attribute = value", ignoring card boundaries.
Multiple world coordinate systems (other than the physical and one world
system) cannot be used with old format image headers.

.nh 2
Handling of the WCS by IMIO

    When an image is opened by IMIO the image header is read, an MWCS
descriptor is opened, and the stored MWCS is loaded into the MWCS descriptor
from the image header.  If an image section has been opened the Lterm
is then updated to reflect the additional linear transformation defined
by the section.  The correct logical to physical or world transformation
is then seen at the IMIO level, and will be propagated to a new image
in a NEW_COPY image operation when the MWCS is copied to the new image.

In the case of an image format which uses a FITS header, application of
the section transform during an image open \fIdoes not\fR include updating
of the FITS representation of the WCS.  There are two problems with doing
so: all this editing of the FITS image of the header is inefficient
unless absolutely necessary, and more seriously, if the image is opened
READ_WRITE with an image section and the header is later updated, the
stored WCS will be incorrect.  So, while the WCS as represented by the
MWCS will always be correct, the FITS header parameters will reflect
the WCS of the raw image ignoring the image section.  If it is necessary
for some reason to update the FITS header in memory to reflect the image
section, \fImw_saveim\fR may be called to perform the udpate.

Propagation of the correct logical system in a NEW_COPY operation works
because once the FITS header is copied, \fImw_saveim\fR is called to
edit the header of the new image.

Restrictions

    Since there was not time to solve the general WCS problem with the MWCS
interface, several restrictions were accepted for this version.  These are
the following.
.ls
.ls o
All WCS functions are built in (hard coded), hence the interface is not
extensible at runtime and the only way to support new applications is
through modification of the interface (by adding new function drivers).
.le
.ls o
There is no support for modeling geometric distortions, except possibly
in one dimension.
.le
.ls o
There is no provision for storing more than one world coordinate system
in FITS oriented image headers, although multiple WCS are supported internally
by the interface, and are preserved and restored across \fImw_save\fR and
\fImw_load\fR operations.
.le
.ls o
Coordinate transforms involving dependent axes must includes all such axes
explicitly in the transform.  Dependent axes are axes which are related,
either by a rotation, or by a WCS function.  Operations which could subset
dependent axis groups, and which are therefore disallowed, include setting
up a transform with an AXES bitmap which excludes dependent axes, or more
importantly, an image section involving dimensional reduction, where the
axis to be removed is not independent.  This could happen, for example,
if a two-dimensional image were rotated and one tried to open a
one-dimensional section of the rotated image.
.le
.le

All these problems can be solved given enough time, although the last problem
mentioned becomes very complicated (perhaps intractable) when nonlinear world
systems of dimension greater than three are involved.

.nh 2
Function Drivers

    World coordinate systems are implemented in MWCS by providing something
called a \fIfunction driver\fR for each function type, as specified by the
\fIwtype\fR argument to \fImw_swtype\fR.  The \fIwtype\fR is the name of
the function, and the name of the function driver.

A function driver consists of the following procedures.  A given driver
need not implement all driver procedures; procedures which are not used
by a driver are set to NULL in the function driver table.

.nf
        operation                       syntax

        FN_INIT                 wf_FCN_init (fc, dir)
        FN_DESTROY           wf_FCN_destroy (fc)
        FN_FWD                   wf_FCN_fwd (fc, pv, wv)
        FN_INV                   wf_FCN_inv (fc, wv, pv)
.fi

where FCN is replaced by a 3 letter abbreviation for the function name,
e.g., "smp" for the sampled WCS function, "tan" for the tangent plane
projection etc.  This is only a suggested naming convention; the actual
driver procedure names are arbitrary so long as name conflicts are
avoided.

The argument FC to each driver procedure is a pointer to the function call
descriptor set up by \fImw_sctran\fR.  This consists of a number of standard
fields followed by an area which is reserved for fields which are private
to the function driver.  During compilation of a transformation, the function
driver initialization procedure FN_INIT will be called to perform any function
dependent initialization, e.g., processing of the attribute list for the
axes assigned to the function, to input any function specific parameters.

During runtime evaluation of a function call, FN_FWD will be called for a
forward transformation (physical to world), and FN_INV for an inverse
transformation (world to physical).  Note that the linear portion of the
WCS, i.e., the CD matrix and all other linear terms except W (the CRVAL
vector) are handled the same for all WCS functions, outside of the driver.
Hence when the driver is called for a forward transformation, for example,
the CD matrix and R vector (defining the reference point) will already
have been applied to the input vector PV.

To fully understand how function drivers are implemented it is probably
simplest to study the existing drivers.
