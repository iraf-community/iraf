NAME
imflsh -- flush any buffered image data to disk
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.nf
subroutine imflsh (im, ier)

integer		im		#I image descriptor of open image
integer		ier		#O status return
.fi
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The \fIimflsh\fR procedure flushes any buffered image data to disk.  Both the
image header and pixel file are updated if either has been modified since
the image was opened, or since the last call to \fIimflsh\fR.  All buffered
image data is automatically flushed when an image is closed with \fIimclos\fR.
Explicit calls to \fIimflsh\fR are rarely needed since synchronization occurs
automatically when the image is closed, but may be desirable in applications
where the image will be open for a substantial period of time, increasing the
possibility of a program abort or interrupt before the image is closed.
Calling \fIimflsh\fR on an image opened for read-only access is harmless.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
A zero status is returned if no image data has been modified and an update
is not necessary, or if either the header or pixel data has been modified and
the update was successful.  The most likely cause of an update failure is lack
of write permission on the image.

.nf
IE_FLUSH:	error flushing buffered data to pixel file
IE_UPDHDR:	error updating image header file
IE_UPDRO:	image header modified but image was opened read only
