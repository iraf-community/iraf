NAME
imcrea -- create a new image
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
subroutine imcrea (image, axlen, naxis, dtype, ier)

character*(*)	image		#I host name of the new image
integer		axlen(7)	#I length of each axis
integer		naxis		#I number of axes
integer		dtype		#I pixel datatype
integer		ier		#O status return
.fi

DESCRIPTION
The \fIimcrea\fR procedure is used to create a new image from scratch,
using only the information passed via the command line arguments.
The image name \fIimname\fR is the host system filename of the new image,
although the extension (".imh") may be omitted if desired.  The dimensionality
of the new image is given by \fInaxis\fR, and the length in pixels of each
axis is given by the first few elements of the array \fIaxlen\fR.
In the current implementation of IMFORT the dimensionality of an image
should not exceed three.  There are no restrictions on the size of an image.

The datatype to be used to store the pixels in the new image is given by
the integer code \fIdtype\fR.  Only two pixel datatypes are currently
supported, i.e., \fIdtype\fR=3 for short integer pixels, and \fIdtype\fR=6
for type real pixels.

Both the image header file and the pixel file are created, and storage is
allocated for the pixel array in the pixel file.  A subsequent call to
\fIimopen\fR is required to access the new image.  The size, dimensionality,
and datatype of the new image cannot be changed once the image has been
created.

RETURN VALUE
A nonzero error code is returned if either the header file or the pixel
file cannot be created for some reason, or if any of the input arguments
are invalid.

.nf
IE_NAXIS:	wrong number of axes on image
IE_AXLEN:	length of each image axis must be .ge. 1
IE_PIXTYPE:	image pixel type must be short or real
IE_CREHDR:	cannot create image
IE_WRHDR:	error writing to image header file
IE_ALCPIX:	cannot create or allocate space for pixel file
IE_ACCPIX:	error writing into pixel file during image create
