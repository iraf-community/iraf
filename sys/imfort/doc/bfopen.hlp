SYNOPSIS

integer function bfopen (fname, acmode, advice)

.fi

DESCRIPTION
The \fIbfopen\fR procedure either opens an existing file for binary
file i/o (\fIacmode\fR 1=read-only or 3=read-write), or creates a new,
zero length file and opens it for binary file i/o with read-write
access mode (\fIacmode\fR 5=new-file).  The \fIadvice\fR parameter
controls the size of the internal file buffer allocated at open time.
The possible values are 1 (random access, small buffer), or 2 (sequential
access, large buffer); anything larger is taken to be the actual size
of the buffer.  Note that the size of the buffer must be an integral
multiple of the size of a disk block.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
The BFIO file descriptor (\fIfd\fR) is returned as the function value if
the file is successfully opened, otherwise a negative value is returned.
