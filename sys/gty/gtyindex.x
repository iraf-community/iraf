# GTY_INDEX_CAPS -- Prepare an index into the caplist string, stored in

# integer code, called the capcode.  We prepare a list of capcodes, keeping
# only the first such code encountered in the case of multiple entries.
# The offset of the capability in the caplist string is associated with each
# capcode.  When these lists have been prepared, they are sorted to permit
# a binary search for capabilities at runtime.
