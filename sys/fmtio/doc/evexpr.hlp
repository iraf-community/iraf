				    EVEXPR
		 Evaluating Algebraic Expressions in SPP Programs
			      dct 17 April 1985

1. Introduction

    EVEXPR is a function which takes an algebraic expression as input,
evaluates the expression, and returns the value of the expression as the
function value.  The input expression (a character string) is parsed and
reduced to a single value.  The operands to the expression may be either
constants or identifiers (foreign strings).  If an identifier is encountered
the user supplied get operand procedure is called to return the value of
the operand.  Operands are described by the operand structure, and operands
are passed about by a pointer to such a structure.  The value of the
expression is returned as the function value and is a pointer to an operand
structure.  Operands of different datatypes may be mixed in an expression
with the usual automatic type coercion rules.  All SPP datatypes are
supported plus the string datatype.  All SPP operators and intrinsic
functions are recognized.

2. Procedures

	op = evexpr (expr, locpr(getop), locpr(ufcn))
	      getop (identifier, op)
	       ufcn (fcn, args, nargs, op)

where

	evexpr	The main entry point.
	expr	A character string, the expression to be evaluated.
	getop	A user supplied procedure which returns the value
		  of a nonconstant operand given the NAME of the operand
		  (a character string) as input.  If locpr(getop) is
		  NULL only constant operands are permitted in the
		  expression.
	ufcn	A user supplied procedure which returns the value of
		  a user defined function given the name of the function
		  as the first argument (a string).  If locpr(ufcn) is
		  NULL only the standard functions are permitted.
	fcn	Name of the function to be evaluated.
	args	Array of pointers to operands (the arguments to the function).
	nargs	Number of arguments to function.
	op	A pointer to an operand structure

A a simple example, consider the following statement which evaluates a
constant expression and prints the value on the standard output.

	include	<evexpr.h>
	pointer	o, evexpr()

	o = evexpr ("sin(.5)**2 + cos(.5)**2)", NULL, NULL)
	switch (O_TYPE(o)) {
	case TY_INT:
	    call printf ("result = %d\n")
		call pargi (O_VALI(o))
	case TY_REAL:
	    call printf ("result = %g\n")
		call pargr (O_VALR(o))
	case TY_CHAR:
	    call printf ("result = %s\n")
		call pargstr (O_VALC(o))
	}

If a syntax error occurs while parsing the expression EVEXPR will take the
error action "syntax error".  The NULL arguments could be replaced by the
LOCPR addresses of get operand and/or user function procedures if required
by the application.

3. Lexical Form

    The lexical form of the input expression is the same as that of SPP and
the CL for all numeric, character, and  string constants and operators.
Any other sequence of characters is considered an identifier and will be
passed to the user supplied get operand function to be turned into an operand.

4. Syntax

    Parsing and evaluating of the input expression is carried out by an SPP/Yacc
parser.  The grammar recognized by the parser is given below.

expr	:	CONST				# numeric or string constant
	|	IDENT				# external operand (getop)
	|	'-' expr %prec UMINUS
	|	expr '+'  expr
	|	expr '-'  expr
	|	expr '*'  expr
	|	expr '/'  expr
	|	expr '**' expr
	|	expr '//' expr
	|	'!' expr
	|	expr '<'  expr
	|	expr '<=' expr
	|	expr '>'  expr
	|	expr '>=' expr
	|	expr '==' expr
	|	expr '!=' expr
	|	expr '&&' expr
	|	expr '||' expr
	|	IDENT '(' arglist ')'		# function call
	|	'?' expr ':' expr		# conditional expression
	|	'(' expr ')'
	;

arglist	:	# Empty.
	|	arglist ',' expr
	;

2. Data Structures

    The operand structure (size 3 su) is used to represent all operands in
expressions and on the parser stack.  Operands are passed to and from the
outside world by means of a pointer to an operand structure.  The caller
is responsible for string storage of string operands passed to EVEXPR.
EVEXPR manages string storage for temporary string operands created during
expression evaluation, as well as storage for the final string value if
the expression is string valued.  In the latter case the value string should
be used before EVEXPR is again called.

	struct operand {
		int	type		# operand datatype
		union {
		bool	v_b		# boolean value
		int	v_i		# integer value
		real	v_r		# real value
		char	*v_s		# string value
		} v
	}

SPP equivalent (<evexpr.h>)

		O_TYPE(o)		# operand datatype
		O_VALB(o)		# boolean value
		O_VALI(o)		# integer value (or string ptr)
		O_VALR(o)		# real value
		O_VALC(o)		# string value
