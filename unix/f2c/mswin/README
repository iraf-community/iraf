f2c.exe.gz is a compressed Win32 console binary for f2c that runs
under Microsoft Windows 9x and NT.  It was compiled by Microsoft
Visual C++ 6.0 by makefile.vc.

Compression is by gzip, source for which is available by ftp
in prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu.  As a convenience, gzip binaries for
several systems (with names of the form system.executable) and
source for the gzip used to compress the *.gz files are available
for ftp from netlib directory gnu/gzip.  In particular, if you
copy gnu/gzip/dos.executable to an MSDOS machine (in binary mode),
rename it gzip.exe, and rename f2c.exe.gz f2c.exz and f2cx.exe f2cx.exz,
then on the MSDOS machine you can recover f2c.exe and f2cx.exe by
executing "gzip -dN f2c.exz f2cx.exz".

"xsum f2c.exe f2c.exe.gz" should give you: 
f2c.exe	b39b23e	245760
f2c.exe.gz	efe20e82	133264
