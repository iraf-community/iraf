libf2c.zip:  uninit.c:  on IA32 Linux systems, leave the rounding
precision alone rather than forcing it to 53 bits; compile with
-DUNINIT_F2C_PRECISION_53 to get the former behavior.  This only
affects Fortran files translated by f2c -trapuv .

NOTE:  the old libf77 and libi77 bundles are no longer being updated.
Use libf2c.zip instead.
