f2c.exe.gz is a compressed MSDOS version of f2c that should run on just
about any MSDOS machine.  It was compiled by Microsoft Visual C++ 1.51
with ccm.bat in March 1999; we do not intend to recompile it again.
It is superceded by the Win32 f2c.exe in directory ../mswin.

f2cx.exe.gz is a compressed MSDOS version of f2c that requires an 80386
or 80486, as it uses extended memory.  It was compiled by the Symantec
C/C++ compiler (version 6.11, with ccs.bat), and it generally can
translate larger Fortran files without running out of memory than can
f2c.exe.

etime.exe.gz is a compressed MSDOS timing program that is of interest
because it can redirect stderr (file descriptor 2).  For example,
invoking

	etime -2foo.err f2c foo.f
or
	etime -2+foo.err f2c foo.f

will cause the output that f2c writes on file descriptor 2 (such as
the names of the subprograms translated and any warning or error
messages) while it processes the Fortran in file foo.f to be written
to file foo.err rather than to the screen.  The first invocation
overwrites foo.err, while the second one appends to it.  (You can
replace "foo.f" with any f2c command-line options and input file name
of your choice, and can similarly change "foo.err" to any file name
you like.  Sensible shells allow redirection of stderr, but etime.exe
is useful with MSDOS's command.com.)  Etime also can run f2cx.exe, or
any other MSDOS program whose arguments fit on its command line.
Execute "etime" or "etime -?" for usage summary.

Compression is by gzip, source for which is available by ftp
in prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu.  As a convenience, gzip binaries for
several systems (with names of the form system.executable) and
source for the gzip used to compress the *.gz files are available
for ftp from netlib directory gnu/gzip.  In particular, if you
copy gnu/gzip/dos.executable to an MSDOS machine (in binary mode),
rename it gzip.exe, and rename f2c.exe.gz f2c.exz and f2cx.exe f2cx.exz,
then on the MSDOS machine you can recover f2c.exe and f2cx.exe by
executing "gzip -dN f2c.exz f2cx.exz".

"xsum f2c.exe f2c.exe.gz f2cx.exe f2cx.exe.gz" should give you:
f2c.exe	1c458998	285402
f2c.exe.gz	e93d0ab	141545
f2cx.exe	f721d8b8	262097
f2cx.exe.gz	13ba4d83	140359
