BIN.FREEBSD

This directory contains host-specific binaries for the FreeBSD version
of IRAF.  These are generated automatically in an HSI bootstrap, which is
performed by the "reboot" command in $iraf/unix.

An exception to the above are the F2C files in this directory.  The F2C
executable, library, and include file, which are manually copied in from
the host system.  These are installed here as IRAF requires them but they
are not typically installed on Linux systems these days.  IRAF XC uses
the f77.sh script in HLIB to compiler Fortran files.  This script is
tailored to use the version of F2C installed here in HBIN.
