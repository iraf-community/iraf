/*
 * ZFIOBF -- FIO interface to UNIX 4.1BSD binary files.
 * This is the interface to general, random access disk resident binary
 * files (as opposed to text files).  The basic strategy is very simple.
 * FIO will request an asynchronous read or write of N device blocks at
 * a given offset.  The offset (one-indexed) is guaranteed by FIO to be
 * aligned on a device block boundary, and to be in bounds.  The size of
 * a device block and of a file are determined at open time by FIO, which
 * calls the zsttbf status routine.
 *
 * FIO ASSUMES that it can extend a file by writing at EOF in an ordinary
 * zawrbf call with the appropriate one-indexed byte offset.  If the last
 * block in the file is a partial block, FIO will write at some device
 * block offset within the file, after first reading the partial block
 * into the FIO buffer.  FIO will never write a partial block within
 * a file, but assumes it can do so at the end of the file.  If the OS
 * does not support irregular length files, the interface routines should
 * simulate it somehow.  The FIO buffer is an integral number of SPP chars
 * in size, and read requests (in units of bytes) will always be for an integral
 * number of chars.
 *
 * In UNIX 4.1BSD, there is no such thing as asynchronous i/o, so we have
 * to fake it.  Also, the UNIX i/o interface is sequential/seek, while the
 * FIO interface is absolute offset, so we have to keep track of the file
 * position to avoid a seek on every i/o access.

 * It is also legal to open RW and append by seeking to EOF and writing,
