NAME
zflstx -- flush any buffered text file output
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zflstx (chan, status)

int	chan			# OS channel of text file
int	status
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
Any output data buffered within the kernel or host system is flushed to
the output device.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned in the event of a write error.  OK is returned if the flush
is successful.  There is no way to tell if any data was actually written to
the output device.
.ih
NOTES
FIO assumes that text file output is buffered and that \fBzflstx\fR must be
called to ensure that data written with \fBzputtx\fR is actually sent to
the device.  When \fBzflstx\fR is called all buffered text should be output
whether or not a newline has been seen.  FIO assumes that it can build up
an output line a character at a time, calling \fBzputtx\fR followed by
\fBzflstx\fR for each individual character.
