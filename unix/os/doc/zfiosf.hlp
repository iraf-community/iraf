DESCRIPTION
The static file driver is used to randomly access binary files which do not
change in size once created, hence the term static.  Except where noted
herein, the specifications of the static file driver are equivalent to those
of the ordinary random access binary file driver.

A static binary file is created by the kernel primitive \fBzfaloc\fR,
hence \fBzopnsf\fR cannot be used to create a new file (NEW_FILE mode is not
supported).  The asynchronous read and write primitives behave conventionally
except that writing at EOF or overwriting EOF is not permitted.

NOTES
The static file driver should provide the lowest possible level of binary
file i/o for maximum efficiency.  Since the file size is known at file creation
time it is often possible to allocate a contiguous file.  Given a contiguous or
nearly contiguous file which does not change in size it is sometimes possible
to bypass the host files system once the file has been created, i.e., to
map the \fBzfiosf\fR primitives directly into calls to the disk driver on the
host machine.

On a virtual memory machine it may also be possible to map the static file
into virtual memory, i.e., defer i/o until the file data is actually used.
If a virtual memory interface is implemented \fBzardsf\fR will remap pages
of memory, \fBzawrsf\fR will update pages of memory, \fBzawtsf\fR will do
nothing but return status, and \fBzclssf\fR will update and unmap any
mapped pages and close the file.  See the reference manual for further
discussion of static file implementation strategies.
