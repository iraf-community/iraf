.ih
NAME
zgfdir -- get next filename from a directory
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zgfdir (chan, osfn, maxch, status)

int	chan			# OS channel of directory file
packed	char osfn[maxch]	# output filename
int	maxch, status
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
The next machine dependent filename is returned from the directory file
connected to \fIchan\fR.  Filenames are not returned in any particular order.
The filename is returned as an EOS delimited packed string with no newline.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
The number of characters in the filename excluding the EOS delimiter is
returned for a successful read.  EOF is returned when the directory is
exhausted.  ERR is returned if there is something wrong with \fIchan\fR,
if a read error occurs, or if the output string overflows.
.ih
NOTES
Although this primitive returns simple, raw host filenames, it will not
necessarily return all of the filenames in a directory.  On a UNIX system
for example, filenames which begin with the character "." are skipped over
when reading from a directory.  On a VMS system only the most recent version
of a file should be returned (with the version label stripped).  The kernel
may employ hidden files for special purposes; normally these should be
hidden from the high level code and from the user.
