NAME
zopntx -- open a text file
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zopntx (osfn, mode, chan)

packed	char osfn[]		# OS filename
int	mode			# access mode
int	chan			# OS channel assigned to file
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
The text file \fIosfn\fR is opened with access mode \fImode\fR and
assigned the channel \fIchan\fR.  The legal access modes for text files
are as follows:

.nf
	READ_ONLY	1	open existing file for reading
	READ_WRITE	2    ** NOT SUPPORTED FOR TEXT FILES **
	WRITE_ONLY	3	same as append mode
	APPEND		4	open or create for appending
	NEW_FILE	5	create for appending
.fi

If a nonexistent text file is opened for appending the file is created,
i.e., appending to a nonexistent file is equivalent to mode NEW_FILE.
READ_WRITE mode is not supported for text files since text file i/o is
sequential.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the named file does not exist, cannot be opened with the
specified access mode, cannot be created, or if an illegal mode is specified.
If the operation is successful the nonegative magic channel number assigned
by the kernel to the file is returned in \fIchan\fR.
.ih
NOTES
FIO will not call \fBzopntx\fR to open a new file if a file with the same
name already exists.  FIO will instead either delete the file (if file clobber
is enabled) or take an error action.  FIO does not assume anything about the
file position at open time; \fBzsektx\fR is called shortly after \fBzopntx\fR
to position the file to either BOF or EOF depending on the access mode.

The file access permissions (owner, group, world permissions) of a new file
are set by the kernel to either host system default values or to user definable
values when the file is created.  The technique by which this is done is machine
dependent.  Many systems provide an automatic system default set of
permissions, e.g., read permission for everyone but write permission only
for the owner, but give the user the option of globally overriding the default.
