NAME
zxgmes -- get info on most recent exception
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zxgmes (os_exception, errmsg, maxch)

int	os_exception		# machine dependent exception code
packed	char errmsg[maxch]	# machine dependent error message
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
A description of the most recent hardware or software exception is returned.
The integer code \fIos_exception\fR is the machine dependent code for the
exception, and \fIerrmsg\fR is a specific, machine dependent string
describing the exception.  A program which merely calls \fBzxgmes\fR
to fetch and print the error message can be informative without compromising
portability (e.g., the default exception handlers do this).
.ih
RETURN VALUE
OK is returned for \fIos_exception\fR if no exception has occurred since
process startup or since the last call to \fBzxgmes\fR.  If \fBzxgmes\fR
is called repeatedly following a single exception all calls after the first
will return OK.
.ih
NOTES
Any program which uses machine dependent exception codes is machine dependent.
The usage should be parameterized and documented in one of the system config
files.
