NAME
zopnbf -- open a binary file
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zopnbf (osfn, mode, chan)

packed	char osfn[]		# OS filename
int	mode			# access mode
int	chan			# OS channel assigned to file
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
File \fIosfn\fR is opened with access mode \fImode\fR and connected to
channel \fIchan\fR for binary file i/o.  The legal access modes for a
binary file are as follows:

.nf
	READ_ONLY	1	open existing file for reading
	READ_WRITE	2	open existing file for both r&w
	WRITE_ONLY	3	open existing file for writing
	APPEND		4	open or create file for appending
	NEW_FILE	5	create a new file for both r&w
.fi

APPEND mode is the same as WRITE_ONLY for most devices, except that in APPEND
mode a new file will be created if none already exists.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the named file does not exist or cannot be created,
if insufficient permission is available for the access mode requested,
or if an unknown access mode is specified.  If the operation is successful
the magic integer channel number assigned to the channel is returned
in \fIchan\fR (a nonnegative integer value).
.ih
NOTES
FIO will not call \fBzopnbf\fR to open a new file if a file with the same
name already exists.  FIO will instead either delete the file (if file clobber
is enabled) or take an error action.

The file access permissions (owner, group, world permissions) of a new file
are initialized by the kernel to either host system default values or to user
definable values when the file is created.
The technique by which this is done is machine dependent.
Many systems provide an automatic system default set of permissions,
e.g., read permission for everyone but write permission only
for the owner, but give the user the option of globally overriding the default.
