NAME
zzopmt -- open a magtape file
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zzopmt (drive, density, mode, oldrec, oldfile, newfile, chan)

int	drive		# logical drive number (1, 2,...)
int	density		# e.g. 0, 800, 1600, 6250
int	mode		# access mode (RO or WO)
int	oldrec		# current record number within file
int	oldfile		# current file number on tape
int	newfile		# requested/actual new file number
int	chan		# OS channel assigned to file
.fi

DESCRIPTION
The magnetic tape on logical drive number \fIdrive\fR is opened positioned to
record 1 (the first record) of file number \fInewfile\fR.  The logical drive
numbers 1 through N, where N is the number of logical tape drives on the host
system, are associated with the user interface logical drive names "mta",
"mtb", etc.  by the high level code.
The current position of the tape at open time is
given by the arguments \fIoldrec\fR and \fIoldfile\fR.  When the tape is
rewound it is positioned to record 1 of file 1.  The file number \fInewfile\fR
is either the number of the desired file on the tape (newfile >= 1) or EOT
(newfile <= 0).  There is no way to position beyond EOT.  The \fIdensity\fR
is a magic number of significance only to the user and to the kernel.
The tape is opened with a device dependent default density if \fIdensity\fR
is zero.  The legal access modes for a magtape file are READ_ONLY and
WRITE_ONLY.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned in \fIchan\fR if there is no such drive, if the drive
does not support the requested density, if the tape cannot be positioned,
or if the drive cannot be physically opened.  It is not an error if the
file number is out of range; the actual number of the file to which the tape
was positioned is returned in \fInewfile\fR.  If the tape contains N files
and \fBzzopmt\fR is called to open the tape positioned to EOT, \fInewfile\fR
will have the value N+1 when the procedure exits.
.ih
NOTES
The high level procedure \fBmtopen\fR verifies that the drive has been
allocated and that the drive is not already open before calling \fBzzopmt\fR.  
The \fIchan\fR argument should be set when the drive is physically opened,
rather than upon exit from \fBzzopmt\fR, in case an exception occurs while
the tape is being positioned (the high level error recovery code must have
the channel number to close the device).  If the drive is to be opened
WRITE_ONLY the kernel should open the drive READ_ONLY to position to the
desired file, then close the drive and reopen for writing.  This prevents
truncation of the tape from writing a tape mark if error recovery occurs while
the tape is being positioned (error recovery will call \fBzzclmt\fR).

BUGS
The tape may runaway if the density is incorrectly specified or if a blank
tape is opened for reading or appending.
