NAME
zmfree -- free memory
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zmfree (buffer, status)

int	buffer			# buffer address
int	status
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
Free a buffer previously allocated with \fBzmaloc\fR or \fBzraloc\fR,
i.e., return the space so that it may be reused by the same process or by
another process.  The integer argument \fIbuffer\fR must be the buffer
address returned by the primitive which originally allocated the buffer.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if there is something wrong with \fIbuffer\fR.  OK is returned
if the operation is successful.
.ih
NOTES
When a buffer is deallocated memory space may or may not be returned to the
host operating system depending upon the address of the buffer and upon the
characteristics of the host system.  If physical memory space can be
efficiently allocated to a process at runtime it is desirable to immediately
return deallocated space to the host so that it may be reused by another
process.  Otherwise the space will remain physically allocated to the process
but will be placed on the memory allocator free list so that it may be
reallocated in a subsequent call to \fBmalloc\fR.
