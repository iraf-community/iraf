NAME
zfinfo -- get directory information for the named file
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
include <finfo.h>

zfinfo (osfn, out_struct, status)

packed	char osfn[]			# host filename
long	out_struct[LEN_FINFO]		# output structure
int	status
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
A binary structure is returned describing the named file.

.nf
	struct finfo {
		long	fi_type		# file type
		long	fi_size		# file size, bytes
		long	fi_atime	# time of last access
		long	fi_mtime	# time of last modify
		long	fi_ctime	# time of file creation
		long	fi_perm		# file permission bits
		char	fi_owner[15]	# name of file owner
	}

File types:

	FI_REGULAR	1		# ordinary file
	FI_DIRECTORY	2		# directory file
	FI_EXECUTABLE	3		# executable image
	FI_SPECIAL	4		# terminals etc.
.fi

The file owner name is returned as a packed string.  Times are in long integer
seconds since midnight Jan 1, 1980 LST.  File permissions are encoded in
bits 1-6 of \fIfi_perm\fR as follows:

.nf
	bit 1,2		owner r,w
	bit 3,4		group r,w
	bit 5,6		world r,w
.fi

An ordinary file may be either a text file or a binary file.  A directory file
is the entry for a subdirectory of the directory referenced by \fBzfinfo\fR.
An executable file is a file marked executable by the host (the exact
significance of an executable file is machine dependent).
Everything else is a special file.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the named file does not exist or cannot be accessed.
OK is returned if the operation is successful.
.ih
NOTES
\fBZfinfo\fR is not used to determine if a file is protected from deletion
or to determine whether a file is a text or binary file.  \fBZfinfo\fR should
not be called to obtain information on an open file.
