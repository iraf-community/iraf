NAME
zxwhen -- post an exception handler
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
include <when.h>

zxwhen (exception, new_handler, old_handler)

int	exception		# virtual exception code
int	new_handler		# EPA of new handler
int	old_handler		# EPA of old handler
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
The exception handler procedure \fInew_handler\fR is posted for the specified
virutal exception, i.e., \fInew_handler\fR will be called if the indicated
exception should occur.  The integer value of \fInew_handler\fR must be either
the entry point address (EPA) of a procedure as returned by \fBzlocpr\fR, or the
integer constant X_IGNORE (zero), used to disable exceptions.  The recognized
virtual exceptions, defined in <when.h>, are as follows:

.nf
	X_ACV	    501		    # access violation
	X_ARITH     502		    # arithmetic error
	X_INT	    503		    # keyboard interrupt
	X_IPC	    504		    # write to IPC with no reader
.fi

In general many host-specific exceptions may be mapped to a single virtual
exception.  All host exceptions which are not caught internally by the kernel
are mapped to one of the four virtual exceptions.  An exception handler
remains posted after it has been called.  The user exception handler must
have the following calling sequence:

	user_handler (exception, next_handler)

The kernel calls the user handler procedure with the integer code of the
virtual exception which actually occurred as the first argument; thus a
single handler may be posted to more than one exception.  The user handler
may either directly or indirectly call \fBzdojmp\fR to initiate error
recovery, in which case the procedure does not return.  If the handler
procedure returns, \fInext_handler\fR must be set either to X_IGNORE or to the
EPA of the next_handler, i.e., to the value of \fIold_handler\fR received
when the current handler was posted.  If X_IGNORE is returned execution
will continue normally.  If the EPA of another handler procedure is returned
that handler will receive control, hence a chain of handlers may be called
to handle an exception.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
A panic exit occurs if an unknown \fIexception\fR is specified.  If the
operation is successful \fIold_handler\fR will contain either X_IGNORE or
the EPA of the previous handler.

NOTES
The IRAF Main posts a default exception handler to all four exceptions upon
process startup.  The default handler allows arithmetic exceptions to be
caught by inline error handlers (i.e., \fBiferr\fR statements) in user code.
Access violations and interrupts may only be caught by posting an exception
handler.  If an exception is not caught program execution is aborted,
error restart occurs, and any user procedures posted with \fBonerror\fR are
callled.  See the System Interface reference manual and the SPP reference
manual for a more detailed discussion of exception and error handling in
the high level code.
