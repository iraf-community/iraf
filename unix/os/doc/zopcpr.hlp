DESCRIPTION
The executable file \fIprocess_file\fR is spawned as a child process and
connected to the parent via the IPC (inter-process communication) channels
\fIinchan\fR and \fIoutchan\fR.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
ERR is returned if the named subprocess cannot be connected.  If the connection
succeeds the process-id of the child is returned in \fIpid\fR.
.ih
NOTES
Only the IPC driver may be used to read and write the IPC channels.
A process spawned with \fBzopcpr\fR must be closed with \fBzclcpr\fR.
On a multi-processor system the OSFN \fIprocess_file\fR may be used to
specify the processor on which the child process is to be spawned.
