DESCRIPTION
A binary file is an extendable array of machine bytes.  There are two types
of binary files: \fBblocked\fR files, which are randomly accessible in chunks
the size of a device block, and \fBstreaming\fR binary files, which are
restricted to sequential access and characterized by a variable block size.
A binary file is effectively an extension of host memory, i.e., arbitrary
regions of memory may be written to a binary file and later restored
(possibly at a different location) without modification of the data.
Unlike the text file, there are no restrictions on the contents of a binary
file.

RETURN VALUES
When a binary file is opened the kernel assigns a channel to the file
and all subsequent file operations refer to the file by the channel number.
The asynchronous read and write primitives do not return a status value;
the number of bytes read or written or ERR is returned in a subsequent
call to \fBzawtbf\fR.  Every i/o transfer must be followed by a call to
\fBzawtbf\fR.  Only one transfer is permitted on a file at a time.

NOTES
If a file is accessed by name (rather than by channel number) while the file
is open the results are machine dependent.
If a file is blocked reads and writes must be aligned on block boundaries;
file offsets are one-indexed.  A binary file may be extended by writing at
EOF or by overwriting EOF.  All blocks but the last in a blocked file are the
same size; the last block may be partially full.  A write to a streaming
file appends a new block of size \fInbytes\fR to the file; successive blocks
may vary in size.  Each read from a streaming file returns a single variable
length block.
