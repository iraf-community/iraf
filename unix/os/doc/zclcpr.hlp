NAME
zclcpr -- close or disconnect a connected subprocess
.ih
SYNOPSIS

.nf
zclcpr (pid, exit_status)

int	pid			# process id (a magic integer)
int	exit_status		# termination code from process
.fi

.ih
DESCRIPTION
Disconnect a subprocess previously connected with \fBzopcpr\fR,
i.e., close the IPC channels and wait for the subprocess to terminate.
Control does not return until the child process has terminated.

If the child process attempts to write to the parent after the IPC channels
have been closed the X_IPC exception will be raised in the child process.
If the child attempts to read from the parent after the parent has
disconnected, the child will see EOF on the read and will shutdown.
.ih
RETURN VALUE
The integer termination code of the child process is returned in
\fIexit_status\fR.  A status of OK (zero) indicates normal termination.
ERR is returned for an illegal \fIpid\fR.
If the child terminates abnormally, i.e., if a panic exit occurs, the positive
integer error code of the error which caused process termination is returned.
