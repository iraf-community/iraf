/*
 * ZFIOSF -- Static file device driver.  In the 4.1BSD UNIX kernel the ordinary
 * binary file driver is used for static files (files that do not change in
 * size once created by ZFALOC), hence all we need do to implement a SF routine
 * is call the corresponding BF routine.  A great gain in i/o efficiency could 
 * probably be gained by replacing this driver by one using raw i/o, but we do
 * not want to bother with that for 4.1BSD UNIX because the time would be
 * better spent doing it for 4.2BSD.
 *
 * If anyone is stuck with 4.1BSD for some reason and wants fast static file
 * i/o, the strategy is to try to allocate contiguous files with ZFALOC, either
 * in a raw partition using a special file manager or within an ordinary
 * partition adding a new system call to allocate contiguous storage for a file.
 * The latter scheme has the advantage that files thus created are ordinary
 * UNIX files and can be accessed normally as well as by the static file driver.
 * Given a contiguous or near-contiguous file on disk, all the static file
 * driver needs for direct access with large transfers is the physical block
 * offset of the file.  The raw device is then accessed via physio calls to
 * transfer data directly to or from the user's buffer, bypassing the system
 * buffer cache.  Write perm is required on the raw device for the target
 * filesystem; this opens up the possibility of trashing the files system.
 * Static file access should be restricted to one or more large temporary files
 * systems.  If one gets really ambitious a special UNIX driver can be added to
 * permit asynchronous i/o, bypassing the UNIX files system entirely except
 * during file creation and deletion.
