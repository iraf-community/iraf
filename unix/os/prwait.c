/* Process table code.  The high level code assumes that it can open and close
 * processes in any order.  The UNIX "wait" primitive, called when a process is
 * closed, returns the process status and pid of the first process to exit.
 * Hence several calls to wait may be necessary to wait for a given process to
 * exit.  We hide all this behind the pr_wait call, which waits for a PARTICULAR
 * process to exit and returns its exit status.
 *
 * NOT INTERFACE PROCEDURES.  This code is only called internally by other
 * kernel procedures.  All primitives which execute subprocesses, i.e., ZOPCPR,
 * ZOPDPR, ZOSCMD, etc. must call these routines.
