/*
 * ZFIOLP -- IRAF FIO interface to the line printer device.  The line printer
 * is opened as a streaming type (no seeks) write-only binary device.
 * On systems like UNIX in which the line printer is just another file,
 * the interface is trivial; we just call the FIOBF routines.  On other
 * systems it might be necessary to spool the output to a binary file
 * and dispose of the file to a queue when the printer file is closed,
 * or some such thing.
 *
 * Currently, the CL-callable LPRINT program is the only thing in IRAF which
 * writes to the printer.  Most programs are intended to write to their
 * standard output or a file, which is subsequently copied to the printer
 * by the user or by a CL level script.  LPRINT uses "dev$*.tty" descriptors
 * and the TTY interface to learn the characteristics of the printer (eject
 * is considered equivalent to a tty clear, for example).
 *
 * The system and device dependent information necessary to perform these
 * functions is contained in three strings passed as the "printer" parameter
 * to ZOPNLP.  The strings come from the TERMCAP entry for the device.
 * The format of such a string is
 *
 *	device D spoolfile D dispose_cmd EOS
 *
 * where DEVICE is the logical device name (not used herein), D is the field
 * delimiter character (the first nonalphnumeric character encountered after
 * the device field), SPOOLFILE is a UNIX pathname to be passed to MKTEMP
 * to create the spoolfile pathname, and DISPOSE_CMD is a fill-in-the-blanks
 * template for a UNIX shell command which will dispose of the spoolfile to
 * the printer device.
