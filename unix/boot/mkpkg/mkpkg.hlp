NAME
mkpkg - make or update a package or library
.ih
USAGE
mkpkg [switches] [module ...] [name=value ...]
.ih
ARGUMENTS
.ls 10 \fB-d[ddd]\fR
Debug mode.  Print detailed messages describing what \fImkpkg\fR is doing.
There are four levels of debug messages, selected by repeating the "d"
character in the switch, e.g., "-d" is level one, "-dd" is level two, and
so on.  The debug messages get progressively more detailed as the debug level
increases.  Debug mode automatically enables the verbose mode messages.
.le
.ls 10 \fB-f file\fR
Set the name of the file to be interpreted (default: "mkpkg").
The special value "stdin" (lower case) allows commands to be entered
interactively from the standard input, e.g., for debugging \fImkpkg\fR.
.le
.ls 10 \fB-i\fR
Ignore errors.  Execution continues even if an error occurs.  In most cases
it does anyhow, so this switch has little effect at present.
.le
.ls 10 \fB-n\fR
No execute.  Go through the motions, but do not touch any files.
No execute mode automatically enables verbose mode (flag "-v").
This switch should be used to verify new mkpkg files before execution.
.le
.ls 10 \fB-p \fIpkgname\fR
Load the package environment for the named external package, e.g.,
"mkpkg -p noao update".  If the same package is always specified
the environment variable or logical name PKGENV may be defined at the
host level to accomplish the same thing.  The package name \fImust\fR
be specified when doing software development in an external or layered
package.
.le
.ls 10 \fB-u\fR    [AOSVS/IRAF only]
Forcibly update the dates of improperly dated library modules.  This option
is used when a binary archive is restored on a machine which cannot restore
the file modify dates.  In this case, all source file dates would appear to
have been modified since the libraries were updated, causing all sources to
be recompiled.  By running \fImkpkg\fR with the \fI-u\fR flag, one can update
the library module dates without recompiling the associated files.  This is
done by setting the date of each library module to be no older than the
file \fIhlib$iraf.h\fR, which should be "touched" after the system has fully
been restored to disk to mark the installation time.  Note that files which
have been modified \fIsince\fR the system was restored to disk will still
cause the affected library modules to be updated, even when the \fI-u\fR flag
is specfied.
.le
.ls 10 \fB-v\fR
Verbose mode.  A message is printed whenever a file is touched.
Recommended when running large mkpkg jobs in batch mode.
.le
.ls 10 \fBmodule\fR
The names of the module or modules (named entries in the "mkpkg" file) to be
executed.  If no module is named the first module encountered is executed,
unless a \fImkpkg\fR macro preprocessor directive at the beginning of the file
specifies a different default action.
.le
.ls 10 \fBname=value [name=value...]\fR
Enter the named symbol/value pair into the symbol table of the \fImkpkg\fR
macro preprocessor.  The symbols \fIXFLAGS\fR (for the XC compiler) and
\fILFLAGS\fR (for the linker) are predefined but may be redefined on the
command line.  Case is ignored in symbol names for portability reasons.
.le

DESCRIPTION
The \fImkpkg\fR utility is used to make or update IRAF packages or libraries.
\fIMkpkg\fR is used to bootstrap the IRAF system hence is implemented as
a foreign task, callable either from within the IRAF environment or from the
host system.  Usage is identical in either case (except that the details of
when a particular argument may need to be quoted will vary depending on the
command language used).  \fIMkpkg\fR is upwards compatible with the old
\fImklib\fR utility.

.tp 4
1. \fBIntroduction\fR

    \fIMkpkg\fR provides two major facilities: a library update capability and
a macro preprocessor.  The macro preprocessor provides symbol definition and
replacement, conditional execution, and a number of builtin commands.
The usefulness of these facilities is enhanced by the ability of \fImkpkg\fR
to update entire directory trees, or to enter the hierarchy of \fImkpkg\fR
descriptors at any level.  For example, typing "mkpkg" in the root directory
of IRAF will make or update the entire system, whereas in the "iraf$sys"
directory \fImkpkg\fR will update only the system libraries, and in the
"iraf$sys/fio" directory \fImkpkg\fR will update only the FIO portion of the
system library "libsys.a".

The \fImkpkg\fR utility is quite simple to use to maintain small packages
or libraries, despite the complexity of the discussion which follows.
The reader is encouraged to study several examples of working mkpkg-files
before reading further; examples will be found throughout the IRAF system.
The mkpkg files for applications packages tend to be very similar to one
another, and it is quite possible to successfully copy and modify the
mkpkg-file from another package without studying the reference information
given here.

.tp 4
2. \fBLexical Conventions\fR

    The lexical conventions employed in \fImkpkg\fR are those used throughout
IRAF.  Comments may occur anywhere, begin with the character #, and extend
to the end of the current line.  Blank lines are ignored virtually everywhere.
Newline may be escaped with backslash to continue on the next line.
All filenames are IRAF virtual filenames with the following extensions.

.ks
.nf
	.a		object library
	.c		C source
	.e		executable (e.g., "x_package.e")
	.f		Fortran source
	.gc		generic C source
	.gx		generic SPP source
	.h		C or SPP header file
	.inc		include file
	.l		Lex source
	.o		object file
	.r		Ratfor source
	.s		assembler source
	.y		Yacc source
.fi
.ke

Since \fImkpkg\fR is an IRAF utility it recognizes the major IRAF logical
directories; these are summarized in the list below.  The IRAF (or UNIX)
pathname convention is used to specify pathnames rooted in the current
directory or a logical directory.

.ks
.nf
	as$		where .s files go		host$as/
	bin$		installed executables		iraf$bin/
	dev$		device tables			iraf$dev/
	hlib$		machdep header files		host$hlib/
	host$		host system interface		[MACHDEP]
	iraf$		the root directory of IRAF	[MACHDEP]
	lib$		system library			iraf$lib/
	math$		math sources			iraf$math/
	pkg$		applications packages		iraf$pkg/
	sys$		the VOS, system libraries	iraf$sys/
	tmp$		where temporary files go	[MACHDEP]
.fi
.ke

All other directories should be referenced by giving the path from either the
current directory or from one of the system logical directories shown above.
For example, "pkg$system/" is the root directory of the SYSTEM package,
and ".." is the directory one level up from the current directory.

.tp 4
3. \fBMaintaining Libraries with MKPKG\fR

    Libraries are described by a \fBmember list\fR module in the "mkpkg" file.
The syntax of a library member list module is shown below.  Note that the
\fBmkpkg\fR module name for a library member list module is the same as the
name of the actual library, hence must end with the extension ".a".

.ks
.nf
	libname.a:
		member1		dep1 dep2 ... depN
		member2		dep1 dep2 ... depN
		  ...
		memberN		dep1 dep2 ... depN
		;
.fi
.ke

Here, "libname.a" is the IRAF virtual filename of the library (regardless of
what directory it resides in), "memberN" is the name of a source file which
may contain any number of actual library object modules, and "depN" is the
name of a file upon which the named member depends.  If any of the named
dependency files is newer than the corresponding member source file, or if
the member source file is newer than the compiled library object module,
the source file is recompiled and replaced in the library.  Both source
files and dependency files may reside in remote directories.  The names of
dependency files in system libraries should be enclosed in <> delimiters,
e.g., "<fset.h>".  Each member must be described on a separate line.

If the library being updated does not reside in the current directory
(directory from which the "mkpkg" command was entered) then the library must
be "checked out" of the remote directory before it can be updated, and checked
back in when updating is complete.  These operations are performed by macro
preprocessor directives, e.g.:

.ks
.nf
	$checkout libsys.a lib$
	$update   libsys.a
	$checkin  libsys.a lib$
	$exit

	libsys.a:
		@symtab		# update libsys.a in ./symtab
		brktime.x	<time.h>
		environ.x	environ.com environ.h <ctype.h>\
				<fset.h> <knet.h>
		main.x		<clset.h> <config.h> <ctype.h>\
				<error.h> <fset.h> <knet.h>\
				<printf.h> <xwhen.h>
		onentry.x	<clset.h> <fset.h> <knet.h>
		spline.x	<math.h> <math/interp.h>
		;
.fi
.ke

Note that the checkout operation is required only in the directory from which
the "mkpkg" command was entered, since the library has already been checked
out when the mkpkg-file in a subdirectory is called to update its portion
of the library (as in the "@symtab" in the example above).  The checkout
commands should however be included in each mkpkg-file in a hierarchy in such
a way that the library will be automatically checked out and back in if
\fImkpkg\fR is run from that directory.  The checkout commands are ignored
if the mkpkg-file is entered when updating the library from a higher level,
because in that case \fImkpkg\fR will search for the named entry for the
library being updated, ignoring the remainder of the mkpkg-file.

Sometimes it is necessary or desirable to break the library member list up
into separate modules within the same mkpkg-file, e.g., to temporarily
change the value of the symbol XFLAGS when compiling certain modules.
To do this use the "@" indirection operator in the primary module list to
reference a named sublist, as in the example below.  Normal indirection
cannot be used unless the sublist resides in a subdirectory or in a different
file in the current directory, e.g., "@./mki2", since a single mkpkg-file
cannot contain two modules with the same name.  The same restrictions apply
to the \fI$update\fR operator.

.ks
.nf
	libpkg.a:
		@(i2)
		alpha.x
		beta.x
		zeta.f
		;
	i2:
		$set	XFLAGS = "-cO -i2"
		gamma.f
		delta.f
		;
.fi
.ke

In the example above five object modules are to be updated in the library
"libpkg.a".  The files listed in module "i2", if out of date, will be compiled
with the nonstandard XFLAGS (compiler flags) specified by the \fI$set\fR
statement shown.

.tp 4
4. \fBThe MKPKG Macro Preprocessor\fR

    The \fImkpkg\fR macro preprocessor provides a simple recursive symbol
definition and replacement facility, an include file facility, conditional
execution facilities, an OS escape facility, and a number of builtin directives.
The names of the preprocessor directives always begin with a dollar sign;
whitespace is not permitted between the dollar sign and the remainder of the
name.  Several preprocessor directives may be given on one line if desired.
Preprocessor directives are executed as they are encountered, and may appear
anywhere, even in the member list for a library.

.tp 4
4.1 Symbol Replacement

    Symbol substitution in the \fImkpkg\fR macro preprocessor is carried out
at the character level rather than at the token level, allowing macro expansion
within tokens, quoted strings, or OS escape commands.  Macros are recursively
expanded but may not have arguments.

Macros may be defined on the \fBmkpkg\fR command line, in the argument list
to a \fB$call\fR or \fB$update\fR directive (see below), in an include file
referenced with the \fB$include\fR directive, or in a \fB$set\fR directive.
All symbols are global and hence available to all lower level modules,
but symbols are automatically discarded whenever a module exits, hence cannot
affect higher level modules.  A local symbol may redefine a previously
defined symbol.  The IRAF and host system environment is treated as an
extension of the \fBmkpkg\fR symbol table, i.e., a logical directory such
as "iraf" may be referenced like a locally defined symbol.

Macro replacement occurs only when explicitly indicated in the input text,
as in the following example, which prints the pathname of the
\fBdev$graphcap\fR file on the \fBmkpkg\fR standard output.  The sequence
"$(" triggers macro substitution.  The value of a symbol may be obtained
interactively from the standard input by adding a question mark after the
left parenthesis, i.e., "$(?terminal)" (this does not work with the -f stdin
flag).  The contents of a file may be included using the notation
"$(@file)".   Note that case is ignored in macro names; by convention,
logical directories are normally given in lower case, and locally defined
symbols in upper case.

.ks
.nf
	$echo $(dev)graphcap
	!xc $(XFLAGS) filea.x fileb.x
.fi
.ke

Symbols are most commonly defined locally with the \fB$set\fR directive.
The \fB$include\fR directive is useful for sharing symbols amongst different
modules, or for isolating any machine dependent definitions in a separate
file.  The IRAF \fBmkpkg\fR system include file \fBhlib$mkpkg.inc\fR is
automatically included whenever \fImkpkg\fR is run.
.ls 4
.ls \fB$set\fR symbol = value
Enter the named symbol into the symbol table with the given string value.
Any existing symbol will be silently redefined.  Symbols defined within a
module are discarded when the module exits.
.le
.ls \fB$include\fR filename
Read commands (e.g., \fB$set\fR directives) from the named include file.
The include filename may be any legal virtual filename, but only the
major logical directories are recognized, e.g., "iraf$", "host$", "hlib$",
"lib$", "pkg$", and so on.
.le
.le

The use of the \fB$set\fR directive is illustrated in the example below.
Note the doubling of the preprocessor meta-character to avoid macro expansion
when entering the value of the GEN macro into the symbol table.  The sequence
"$$" is replaced by a single "$" whenever it is encountered in the input
stream.

.ks
.nf
	$set GFLAGS = "-k -t silrdx -p ak/"
	$set GEN    = "$generic $$(GFLAGS)"

	ifolder (amulr.x, amul.x) $(GEN) amul.x $endif
.fi
.ke

.tp 4
4.2 Conditional Execution

    Conditional control flow is implemented by the \fB$if\fR directives
introduced in the last example and described below.  The character "n" may
be inserted after the "$if" prefix of any directive to negate the sense of
the test, e.g., "$ifndef" tests whether the named symbol does not exist.
Nesting is permitted.
.ls 4
.ls \fB$ifdef\fR (symbol [, symbol, ...])
.sp
Test for the existence of one of the named symbols.
.le
.ls \fB$ifeq\fR (symbol, value [, value,...])
.sp
Test if the value of the named symbol matches one of the listed value strings.
.le
.ls \fB$iferr\fR
.sp
Test for an error return from the last directive executed which touched
a file.
.le
.ls \fB$iffile\fR (file [, file,...])
.sp
Test for the existence of any of the named files.
.le
.ls \fB$ifnewer\fR (file, filea)
.in -4
\fB$ifnewer\fR (file: filea [, fileb, ...])
.in 4
.sp
Test if the named file is newer (has been modified more recently) than
any of the named files to the right.  The colon syntax may be used for
clarity when comparing one file to many, but a comma will do.
.le
.ls \fB$ifolder\fR (file, filea)
.in -4
\fB$ifolder\fR (file: filea [, fileb, ...])
.in 4
.sp
Test if the named file is older than any of the named files.
.le
.ls \fB$else\fR
.sp
Marks the \fIelse\fR clause of an \fIif\fR statement.  The \fIelse-if\fR
construct is implemented as "$else $if", i.e., as a combination of the two
more primitive constructs.
.le
.ls \fB$endif\fR
.sp
Terminates a $if or $if-$else statement.
.le
.ls \fB$end\fR
.sp
Terminates an arbitrary number of $if or $if-$else statements.  This is most
useful for terminating a long list of $if-$else clauses, where the alternative
would be a long string of $endif directives.
.le
.ls \fB$exit\fR
Terminate the current program; equivalent to a semicolon, but the latter
is normally used only at the end of the program to match the colon at the
beginning, whereas \fB$exit\fR is used in conditionals.
.le
.le

.tp 4
4.3 Calling Modules

    The following preprocessor directives are available for calling \fImkpkg\fR
modules or altering the normal flow of control.
.ls
.ls \fB$call\fR module[@subdir[/file]] [name=value] [name=value...]
.sp
Call the named mkpkg-file module as a subroutine.  In most cases the called
module will be in the current mkpkg-file, but the full module name syntax
permits the module to be in any file of any subdirectory ("./file" references
a different file in the current directory).  Arguments may be passed to
the called module using the symbol definition facility; any symbols
defined in this fashion are available to any modules called in turn by
the called module, but the symbols are discarded when the called module returns.
.le
.ls \fB$update\fR module[@subdir[/file]] [name=value] [name=value...]
.sp
Identical to \fB$call\fR except that the named module is understood to
be a library member list.  The current value of the symbol XFLAGS is used
if XC is called to compile any files.  If the named library does not exist
one will be created (a warning message is issued).
.le
.ls \fB$goto\fR label
.sp
Causes execution to resume at the line following the indicated label.
The syntax of a goto label is identical to that of a mkpkg-file module name,
i.e., a line starting with the given name followed by a colon.
The \fI$goto\fR statement automatically cancels any \fI$if\fR nesting.
.le
.le

.tp 4
4.4 Preprocessor Directives

    The remaining preprocessor directives are described below in alphabetical
order.  Additional capability is available via OS escapes, provided the
resultant machine dependence is acceptable.
.ls
.ls \fB$echo\fR message
.sp
Print the given message string on the standard output.  The string must be
quoted if it contains any spaces.
.le
.ls \fB$checkout\fR file directory
.sp
Check the named file out of the indicated directory.  The checkout operation
makes the file accessible as if it were in the current directory; checkout
is implemented either as a symbolic link or as a physical file copy depending
upon the host system.  The referenced directory may be a logical directory,
e.g., "lib$", or a path, e.g, "pkg$images/".  Checkout is not disabled by
the "-n" flag.
.le
.ls \fB$checkin\fR file directory
.sp
Check the named file back into the indicated directory.  The checkin operation
is implemented either as a remove link or copy and delete depending upon the
host system.  Checkin is not disabled by the "-n" flag.
.le
.ls \fB$copy\fR filea fileb
.sp
Make a copy \fIfileb\fR of the existing file \fIfilea\fR.  On a UNIX host
the copy operation will preserve the file modify date if the file is a library
(to avoid the "symbol table out of date" syndrome).
.le
.ls \fB$delete\fR file [file ...]
.sp
Delete the named file or files.
.le
.ls \fB$generic\fR [-k] [-p prefix] [-t types] [-o root] files
.sp
Run the generic preprocessor on the named files.  The generic preprocessor
is an IRAF bootstrap utility and may not be available on non-UNIX hosts.
.le
.ls \fB$link\fR [switches] file1 file2 ... fileN [-o file.e]
.sp
Call XC with the given argument list to link the indicated files and libraries.
The value of the symbol LFLAGS (default value the null string) is automatically
inserted at the beginning of the command line.  This is equivalent to
"!xc $(LFLAGS) ...".
.le
.ls \fB$move\fR file destination
.sp
Move the named file to the indicated directory, or rename the file in the
current directory.
.le
.ls \fB$omake\fR file [dep1] [dep2 ...]
.sp
Compile the named source file if it does not have a corresponding object file
in the current directory, if the object file is older, or if any of the
listed dependency files are newer (or not found).  The current value of the
symbol XFLAGS is used if XC is called to compile the file.
.le
.ls \fB$purge\fR directory
.sp
Delete all old versions of all files in the named directory.  Nothing is done
if the system does not support multiple file versions.
.le
.ls \fB$special\fR directory : filelist ;
.sp
Add one or more files to the special file list for the host system.  This is
a system facility, not intended for use in applications \fImkpkg\fR files.
The special file list is a list of all source files needing special processing
for the local host system.  Examples of special files are files which are
optimized in assembler (or some other nonstandard language), or files which
must be compiled in a special way to get around bugs in a host compiler.
The special file list makes it possible to flag arbitrary files for special
processing, without having to modify the standard software distribution.
In the IRAF system, the special file list is defined in the file
"hlib$mkpkg.sf" which is included automatically by "hlib$mkpkg.inc" whenever
\fImkpkg\fR is run.

The syntax of a \fIfilelist\fR entry is as follows:

	modname source_file mkobj_command

where \fImodname\fR is the filename of a library module as it appears in a
library module list for the named directory, \fIsource_file\fR is the virtual
pathname of the source file to be used in lieu of the standard portable
source file \fImodname\fR, and \fImkobj_command\fR is the \fImkpkg\fR command
(e.g., $xc or an OS escape) to be executed to compile the named module.
The character "&" appearing in either the source file name or mkobj command
is replaced by \fImodname\fR.  If the \fImkobj_command\fR is omitted the
specified source file will be compiled with $XC using the current value of
XFLAGS.
.le
.ls \fB$xc\fR [switches] file1 file2 ... fileN
.sp
Call the XC compiler to compile the named files.  Note that the value of
the symbol XFLAGS is \fInot\fR used when XC is explicitly called in this
fashion (XFLAGS is used by \fB$update\fR and \fB$omake\fR).
.le
.ls \fB$debug\fR [on|off]
.sp
Turn debug mode on or off.  If no argument is supplied debug mode is turned
on.  Turning on debug mode automatically enables verbose mode.
.le
.ls \fB$verbose\fR [on|off]
.sp
Turn verbose mode on or off.  If no argument is supplied verbose mode is turned
on.
.le
.le

.tp 4
5. Error Recovery

    \fBMkpkg\fR is implemented in such a way that it is restartable.  If a mkpkg
operation terminates prematurely for some reason, e.g., because of a compile
error, execution error (such as cannot find the mkpkgfile in a subdirectory),
interrupt, etc., then the mkpkg command can be repeated after correcting
the error, without repeating the operations already completed.  If \fBmkpkg\fR
is interrupted it may leave checked out files, objects compiled but not yet
updated in a library, etc. lying about, but this is harmless and the
intermediate files will be cleaned up when the errors have been corrected
and the run successfully completes.
