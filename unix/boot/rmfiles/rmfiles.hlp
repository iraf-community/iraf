DESCRIPTION
The \fIrmfiles\fR utility is used to delete (or list) files in one or more
directory trees.  If only one directory tree is to be pruned the necessary
instructions can be entered on the command line, otherwise a program file
must be used.  When developing a program file, a dry run using the "-n"
switch is recommended to see what files will be deleted.

If a program file is used each line in the file has one of two possible
formats.  If a directory is to be pruned the syntax is the same as is
used when a one line program is entered on the command line, i.e.:

	rootdir action extns

The significance of each field is as described in the ARGUMENTS section
above.  The program file may also contain lines of the form

	-file filename

to delete one or more files by name.  This is useful for removing files
which do not fit into any recognizable class.

Comments and blank lines are permitted anywhere in the program file.
All filenames are IRAF virtual filenames (or host filenames).

\fIRmfiles\fR is a bootstrap utility implemented as a foreign task, hence
it may be called either from within IRAF or from the host system.

EXAMPLES
1. Delete all .o, .e, .a, and .hd files in the directory "iraf$pkg".
Print the names of the files as they are deleted.  Note that one must
move to the directory containing the directory to be pruned before running
\fIrmfiles\fR.

.nf
	cl> cd iraf
	cl> rmfiles -v pkg .o .e .a .hd
.fi

2. Strip the entire IRAF system, using the program in file "hlib$stripper".
The use of the $ in the filename here could cause problems on some systems
since \fIrmfiles\fR is a foreign task.

.nf
	cl> cd iraf
	cl> rmfiles -vf hlib$stripper
.fi
