# HELPLOG -- Format, edit, and log a new help digest to the system help file.
# 
# Usage:
# 
# helplog [none|system|applications]	log a new help digest
# helplog -e				edit the helpfile (with locking)
# 
# The system helpfile is locked for exclusive access while a help digest is
# being logged, or while the helpfile is being edited.  Logging can be
# aborted either by typing <ctrl/c>, or by editing the editor with ":q!"
# (i.e., by exiting the editor without modifying the temporary file being
# edited).  Help logs are formatted and edited in a small temporary file in
# /tmp and are added at the end of the helpfile only if the task is not
# aborted and the edit modifies the input help log template.  To go back and
# edit a previously logged help digest use "helplog -e".
# 
# Record Format:
# 
# NUMBER:	record number, decimal, sequential.
# KEYWORDS:	search keywords (eg task/package, category)
# DATE:		date help digest logged, unix format date string
# FROM:		user login name
# Q:		digest of question
# A:		digest of answer
# 
# New records are added to the tail of the bugfile.  Left justify field labels,
# indent text to the first tab stop, one blank line between bug entries.
