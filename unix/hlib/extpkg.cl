#  Dynamic Package Loading Script
#
#  This script is "sourced" by the standard hlib$extern.pkg file when the
#  CL is loaded to automatically define any packages installed in the 
#  iraf$extern directory.  Both the package definition and helpdb strings
#  are defined to include the package, negating the previous manual
#  declarations required in hlib$extern.pkg
