This is to fix the "chicken scratches" bug that occurs with IMTOOL on a
sparcstation.  The problem occurs due to a bug in the SunOS kernel for the
sparcstation.  The patch given here is a workaround to avoid the problem
until Sun fixes the bug.

To patch the imtool executable, login as iraf, then make a backup copy of
the imtool.e executable and patch the online one, as follows (be sure to
get the case of the ?X and ?W right):

	% cd $iraf/unix/bin.sparc
	% cp imtool.e imtool.e.OLD
	%
	% adb -w imtool.e
	0xc2a0?X
*	0xc2a0:         ac102018
	0xc2a0?W0xac10200c
*	0xc2a0:         0xac102018      =       0xac10200c
	$q
	%

In the sequence shown above, the lines marked * are adb output.  If the old
value of location 0xc2a0 is not ac102018 (hex) as shown, then you have an
old or otherwise unusual version of IMTOOL and the patch should not be
applied.  Once the executable has been patched, either copy the new executable
to /usr/bin/imtool (or wherever imtool lives on your system) or rerun the
INSTALL script in $hlib.

The fix changes the rasterop used to draw the IMTOOL crosshair cursor from
a copy-source-to-destination to an xor-source-and-destination.  This results
in a less visible cursor, but avoids the bug that leaves the scratches all
over the IMTOOL window.
