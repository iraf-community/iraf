		   Neutral and Ionized Atoms, 1968).

		   by D. Willmarth.  The atlas is available from the
		   KPNO User Support Office.
     henear.dat -  Selected list of HENEAR lines to be used for 
		   KPNO IIDS/IRS reductions - this list is identical to 
		   that in the KPNO mountain reduction software for these 
		   instruments.  Source of wavelengths:  1982 MIT
		   Wavelength Tables Vol. 2.  Multiplet numbers from
		   Charlotte Moore's A Multiplet Table of Astrophysical
		   Interest 1972.

		   range 3300A - 11,100A.  See "A CCD Atlas of Comparison

		   of Astrophysical Interest 1972.
    krypton.dat -  Vacuum wavelengths of the infrared emission lines of krypton.
                   The second column lists relative intensities.  The data  
                   are from "Wavelength Standards in the Infrared", K.N. Rao

lowskylines.dat -  Rest (air) wavelengths of all the OH vibration-rotation
                   lines in the sky spectrum, useful for low dispersion
                   spectra - see "Sky Spectra at a Light-Polluted Site and
                   Wavelength Zero Points", Osterbrock and Martel, UCO/LO

    ohlines.dat -  Vacuum wavelengths from calculations of Chamberlain
                   (lambda < 1.20microns) and laboratory observations of Hubbard
                   and Brault using the Solar FTS (lambda > 1.2microns).
                   The second column gives the observed intensity in kR
                   (Steed and Baker 1979, Appl. Opt., 18, 3386) of observed
                   atmospheric lines.
   skylines.dat -  Night sky lines from various sources compiled by Don
		   York.  See file header for comments.
       thar.dat -  List of thorium-argon lines (3180 - 9665),
