	   COSMIC RAY DETECTION AND REPLACEMENT

   
INTERACTIVE IMAGE CURSOR COMMANDS

When using the image display cursor to define a list of training objects
the following keystrokes may be given.

?	Help
c	Identify the object as a cosmic ray
s	Identify the object as a star
g	Switch to the graphics plot
q	Quit and continue with the cleaning

There are no colon commands.


INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS CURSOR COMMANDS

  The graph shows the ratio of the mean background subtracted flux within the
detection window (excluding the candidate cosmic ray and the second brightest
pixel) to the flux of the candidate cosmic ray pixel as a function of the
mean flux.  Both coordinates have been multiplied by 100 so the ratio is in
precent.  The peaks of extended objects have high flux ratios while true
cosmic rays have low ratios.  The main purpose of this step is to set the
flux ratio threshold for discriminating stars and galaxies.  The cursor
keys are:

?	Help
a	Toggle between showing all objects and only the training objects
d	Mark candidate for replacement (applys to '+' points)
q	Quit.  Returns to training or to replace the selected pixels
r	Redraw the graph
s	Make a surface plot for the candidate nearest the cursor
t	Set the flux ratio threshold at the y cursor position
u	Mark candidate to not be replaced (applys to 'x' points)
w	Adjust the graph window (see GTOOLS)
<space> Print the pixel coordinates for a candidate

There are no colon commands except those for the windowing options (type
:\help or see GTOOLS).
