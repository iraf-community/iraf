This directory contains standard calibration data for extinction and
sensitivity calibration as used in the ONEDSPEC, TWODSPEC, and the various
IMRED packages.


	        	    EXTINCTION TABLES
                (ie extinction = onedstds$kpnoextinct.dat)

			   FLUX STANDARD DIRECTORIES
                        (ie caldir = onedstds$iidscal/)

       bstdscal -  Directory of the brighter KPNO IRS standards (i.e. those 
		   with HR numbers) at 29 bandpasses, data from various
                   sources transformed to the Hayes and Latham system,
                   unpublished.
        ctiocal -  Directory containing fluxes for the southern tertiary
                   standards as published by Baldwin & Stone, 1984, MNRAS,
                   206, 241 and Stone and Baldwin, 1983, MNRAS, 204, 347.
     ctionewcal -  Directory containing fluxes at 50A steps in the range
                   3300-7550 A for the tertiary standards of Baldwin and
                   Stone derived from the revised calibration of Hamuy et al.,
                   1992, PASP, submitted.  This new calibration represents
                   a significant improvement over the original and the fluxes
                   in this directory are in general to be preferred over those
                   in ctiocal.
        iidscal -  Directory of the KPNO IIDS standards at 29 bandpasses,
                   data from various sources transformed to the Hayes and 
                   Latham system, unpublished.
	 irscal -  Directory of the KPNO IRS standards at 78 bandpasses,
                   data from various sources transformed to the Hayes and  
                   Latham system, unpublished (note that in this directory the 
                   brighter standards have no values - the `bstdscal' directory
                   must be used for these standards at this time).
         redcal -  Directory of standard stars with flux data beyond 8370A.
		   These stars are from the IRS or the IIDS directory but
		   have data extending as far out into the red as the
		   literature permits.  Data from various sources.   
   spechayescal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at the Hayes flux
                   points, Table IV, Spectrophotometric Standards, Massey
                   et al., 1988, ApJ 328, p. 315.
  spec16bluecal -  Directory containing fluxes at 16A steps in the range
                   3300-7550A for the bright secondary standards, published
                   in Hamuy et al., 1992, PASP, submitted.
   spec16redcal -  Directory containing fluxes at 16A steps in the range
                   6050-10300A for the bright secondary standards.  These 
                   values were obtained in the spectrophotometric system
                   described by Hamuy et al, 1992, PASP, submitted, and
                   are accurate to better than 2%, except in the range
                   8400-9850A where the accuracy drops to 5% due to the lack
                   of flux points in the calibrating spectrophotometric
                   system.  Work is underway to illiminate this problem at
                   which time these data will be superseded.
      spec50cal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at 50 A intervals.
                   The data are from (1) Table V, Spectrophotometric Standards,
                   Massey et al., 1988, ApJ 328, p. 315 and (2) Table 3, The
                   Kitt Peak Spectrophotometric Standards: Extension to 1
                   micron, Massey and Gronwall, 1990, ApJ 358, p. 344.
