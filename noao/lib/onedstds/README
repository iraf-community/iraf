This directory contains standard calibration data for extinction and
sensitivity calibration as used in the ONEDSPEC, TWODSPEC, and the various
IMRED packages.


                            EXTINCTION TABLES
                (ie extinction = onedstds$kpnoextinct.dat)

ctioextinct.dat -  CTIO extinction table for ONEDSPEC (in Angstroms)
kpnoextinct.dat -  KPNO extinction table for ONEDSPEC (in Angstroms)

                           FLUX STANDARD DIRECTORIES
                        (ie caldir = onedstds$iidscal/)

       bstdscal -  Directory of the brighter KPNO IRS standards (i.e. those 
                   with HR numbers) at 29 bandpasses, data from various
                   sources transformed to the Hayes and Latham system,
                   unpublished.
        ctiocal -  Directory containing fluxes for the southern tertiary
                   standards as published by Baldwin & Stone, 1984, MNRAS,
                   206, 241 and Stone and Baldwin, 1983, MNRAS, 204, 347.
     ctionewcal -  Directory containing fluxes at 50A steps in the blue range
		   3300-7550A for the tertiary standards of Baldwin and
		   Stone derived from the revised calibration of Hamuy et
		   al., 1992, PASP, 104, 533.  This directory also contains
		   the fluxes of the tertiaries in the red (6050-10000A) at
		   50A steps as will be published in PASP (Hamuy et al
		   1994).  The combined fluxes are obtained by gray
		   shifting the blue fluxes to match the red fluxes in the
		   overlap region of 6500A-7500A and averaging the red and
		   blue fluxes in the overlap.  The separate red and blue
		   fluxes may be selected by following the star name with
		   "red" or "blue"; i.e. CD 32 blue.
        iidscal -  Directory of the KPNO IIDS standards at 29 bandpasses,
                   data from various sources transformed to the Hayes and 
                   Latham system, unpublished.
         irscal -  Directory of the KPNO IRS standards at 78 bandpasses,
                   data from various sources transformed to the Hayes and  
                   Latham system, unpublished (note that in this directory the 
                   brighter standards have no values - the `bstdscal' directory
                   must be used for these standards at this time).
         redcal -  Directory of standard stars with flux data beyond 8370A.
                   These stars are from the IRS or the IIDS directory but
                   have data extending as far out into the red as the
                   literature permits.  Data from various sources.   
   spechayescal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at the Hayes flux
                   points, Table IV, Spectrophotometric Standards, Massey
                   et al., 1988, ApJ 328, p. 315.
      spec16cal -  Directory containing fluxes at 16A steps in the blue
		   range 3300-7550A for the secondary standards, published
		   in Hamuy et al., 1992, PASP, 104, 533.  This directory
		   also contains the fluxes of the secondaries in the red
		   (6020-10300A) at 16A steps as will be published in PASP
		   (Hamuy et al 1994).  The combined fluxes are obtained by
		   gray shifting the blue fluxes to match the red fluxes in
		   the overlap region of 6500A-7500A and averaging the blue
		   and red fluxes in the overlap.  The separate red and
		   blue fluxes may be selected by following the star name
		   with "red" or "blue"; i.e. HR 1544 blue.
      spec50cal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at 50 A intervals.
                   The data are from (1) Table V, Spectrophotometric Standards,
                   Massey et al., 1988, ApJ 328, p. 315 and (2) Table 3, The
                   Kitt Peak Spectrophotometric Standards: Extension to 1
                   micron, Massey and Gronwall, 1990, ApJ 358, p. 344.

                        MISCELLANEOUS

           ctio -  Directory containing CTIO decker comb positions and
                   neutral density filter curves (used with NDPREP).
