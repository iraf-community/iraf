This directory contains standard calibration data, such as line lists and
sensitivity calibration, for use in the ONEDSPEC, TWODSPEC, and the various
IMRED packages.

   ctiohear.dat -  HEAR list used at CTIO
     henear.dat -  Selected list of HENEAR lines to be used for 
		   KPNO IIDS/IRS reductions - this list is identical to 
		   that in the KPNO mountain reduction software for these 
		   instruments.  Source of wavelengths:  1982 MIT
		   Wavelength Tables Vol. 2.  Multiplet numbers from
		   Charlotte Moore's A Multiplet Table of Astrophysical
		   Interest 1972.

vacidhenear.dat -  The idhenear.dat list converted to vacuum wavelengths
                   using the equation: (n-1) x 10**8 = 8342.13 + 2406030
                   (130 - sigma**2)**-1 + 15997(38.9 - sigma**2)**-1
                   where sigma = 1/lambda(air). (See B. Edlen, 1966
                   Metrologia, Vol. 2, p. 71).
    thorium.dat -  List of thorium-argon lines (3180 - 9540),

                   (130 - sigma**2)**-1 + 15997(38.9 - sigma**2)**-1
                   where sigma = 1/lambda(air). (See B. Edlen, 1966
                   Metrologia, Vol. 2, p. 71).

	        	    EXTINCTION TABLES
                (ie extinction = onedstds$kpnoextinct.dat)

ctioextinct.dat -  CTIO extinction table for ONEDSPEC (in Angstroms)
kpnoextinct.dat -  KPNO extinction table for ONEDSPEC (in Angstroms)

			   FLUX STANDARD DIRECTORIES
                        (ie caldir = onedstds$iidscal/)

       bstdscal -  Directory of the brighter KPNO IRS standards (i.e. those 
		   with HR numbers) at 29 bandpasses
        ctiocal -  Directory of CTIO standards
        iidscal -  Directory of the KPNO IIDS standards (29 bandpasses)
	 irscal -  Directory of the KPNO IRS standards at 78 bandpasses
		   (note that in this directory the brighter standards
		   have no values - the `bstdscal' directory must be 
		   used for these standards at this time )
         redcal -  Directory of standard stars with flux data beyond 8370A.
		   These stars are from the IRS or the IIDS directory but
		   have data extending as far out into the red as the
		   literature permits.   
   spechayescal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at the Hayes flux
                   points, Table IV, Spectrophotometric Standards, Massey
                   et al., 1988, Ap. J., Vol. 328, p. 315.
      spec50cal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at 50 A intervals,
                   Table V, Spectrophotometric Standards, Massey et al., 1988,
                   Ap. J., Vol. 328, p. 315.
   spec50redcal -  The KPNO spectrophotometric standards at 50 A intervals.
                   These stars are a subset of the spec50cal stars extended out
                   to 1 micron, Table 3, The Kitt Peak Spectrophotometric
