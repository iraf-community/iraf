NAME
widsout -- Convert an IRAF image to IDSOUT text format
.ih
USAGE
widsout image idsout
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
Image to be converted to IDSOUT text format.
.le
.ls idsout
IDSOUT filename for single file output and IDSOUT root name for multiple
file output.
.le
.ls type_output = "multiple"
Type of output to be created.  The options are "single" and "multiple".
In type "single"  the IDSOUT records, one for each image line, are
appended to the file given by the parameter \fIidsout\fR.
In type "multiple" the IDSOUT record for each line is appended to a different
file.  The files have names formed from the root name, given by \fIidsout\fR,
with the extensions .001, .002, etc, where the extension is the image line.
.001, .002, etc.

.ls label =
List structured string parameter for the record labels.
.le
.ls uttime = 0
Universal time in integer seconds.
.le
.ls utdate = 0
Universal date given in the integer format yymmdd.
.le
.ls siderial = 0.
Siderial time in hours.
.le
.ls ra = 0.
Right Ascension in hours.

DESCRIPTION
The \fIimage\fR containing one spectrum per image line is converted to the
IDSOUT card format described below.  There are two types of output selected by
the parameter \fItype_output\fR.  The options for this parameter are "single"
and "multiple".  In type "single"  the IDSOUT records, one for each image line,
are appended to the file given by the parameter \fIidsout\fR.
In type "multiple" the IDSOUT record for each line is appended to a different
file.  The files have names formed from the root name, given by \fIidsout\fR,
with the extensions .001, .002, etc, where the extension is the image line.
Each record contains a record label which is read from the list structured
parameter \fIlabel\fR.  If \fIlabel\fR is not specified the user is prompted
for the label for each image line.  Otherwise the file specified is read
for the labels.  The remaining parameters are general record header information
whose meanings are apparent.

The IDSOUT text format consists of 133 80 character lines.  The format of these
lines is:

.nf
 Line	Column	Type
    1	   1-5	Integer	  Record number within IDSOUT text file
	  6-10	Integer	  Integration time
	 11-25	Real	  Wavelength of first bin
	 26-40	Real	  Dispersion
	 41-45	Integer	  0 (Index of first pixel)
	 46-50  Integer	  Line length - 1 (Index of last pixel)
	 71-80	Integer	  UT time
    2	  1-10	Real	  Siderial time
	 11-25	Real	  Right Ascension
	 26-40	Real	  Declination
    3	 21-35	Real	  Hour Angle
	 36-50	Real	  Air mass
	 51-58	Integer	  UT date
	 60-76	String	  Image title
	 78-80	String	  END
    4	  1-64	String	  Record label
	 78-80	String	  END
5-132		Real	  1024 pixel values, 8 per line
  133			  Blank line
.fi

The data of type real are in exponent format; i.e FORTRAN 'E' format (1.234e3).

EXAMPLES
To convert an two dimensional image containing three spectra to the
output file "idsout":

.nf
	cl> widsout image idsout type_output=single label=file
.fi

where file contains three strings to be used for the record labels.
