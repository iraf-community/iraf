NAME
rcamera -- Convert Kitt Peak CAMERA image files to IRAF image files
.ih
USAGE
rcamera camera_file file_list iraf_file
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls 4 camera_file
The CAMERA data source.  If the data source is a list of disk files or an
explicit tape file
specification of the form mt*[n] where n is a file number. If the file
number is specified then only that file
is converted.  If the general tape device name is given, i.e. mta, mtb800, etc,
then the files specified by the file_list parameter will be read from the tape.
.le
.ls file_list
The files to be read from a tape are specified by the file_list string.  The
string can consist of any sequence of file numbers separated by
at least one of comma, or dash.
A dash specifies a range of files.  For example the string

	"1,2,3-5,8-6"

will convert the files 1 through 8.
.le
.ls iraf_file
The IRAF file which will receive the CAMERA data if the make_image parameter
switch is set.  For multiple disk or tape files the filename
will be used as a prefix and the tape file number or disk sequence number
will be appended.   Otherwise,
the file will be named as specified.  Thus,
reading files 1 and 3 from a CAMERA tape with a iraf_file set to data will
produce the files data001 and data003.
.le
.ls image_list = "1"
The list of CAMERA images to extract from a single tape file. For all recent
tapes image_list = "1". Old tapes were however contained multiple images
per file.
.le
.ls make_image = yes
This switch determines whether CAMERA image data is converted to an IRAF image
file.  This switch is set to no to obtain just header information with the
long_header or short_header switches.
.le
.ls long_header = no
If this switch is set the full CAMERA header is printed on the standard output.
.le
.ls short_header = yes
If this switch is set only the output filename,
the title string, and the image dimensions are printed.
.le
.ls standard_format = yes
The CAMERA standard format has the least significant byte first.  Some CAMERA
data, however, does not follow this byte order convention.  Thus, to read
the non-standard CAMERA data this parameter is set to no.
.le
.ls datatype = "s"
The IRAF image file may be of a different data type than the CAMERA image data.
The data type may be specified as s for short, l for long, r for real, and
d for double.  The user must beware of truncation problems if an
inappropriate data type is specified.  If an incorrect data_type or a
null string is given for this parameter then a default data type is used
which is the appropriate minimum size for the input pixel values.
.le
.ls offset = 0
Offset is an integer parameter specifying the offset to the tape file number
appended to iraf_file. For example if the user specifies offset = 100,
iraf_file = "cam" and file_list = "1-3", the output file names produced
will be "cam101", "cam102" and "cam103" respectively, instead of "cam001",
"cam002" and "cam003".

DESCRIPTION

Kitt Peak CAMERA format image data is read from the specified source;
either a disk or magnetic tape.
The CAMERA header may optionally be printed on the standard
output as either a full listing or a short description.  Image data may
optionally be converted to an IRAF image of specified data type.
