noao$mtlocal/cyber/rrcopy/t_rrcopy.x
    Davis, January 7, 1992
    Modified the rcamera, r2df, rpds, ldumpsf, dumpf, ridsfile, and rrcopy
    tasks to accept the new mag tape name syntax.

noao$mtlocal/lib/mkpkg
noao$pds/lib/mkpkg
    Davis, December 3, 1991
    Added some missing file dependencies for the ranges.x entry (ctype.h
    and mach.h).
    Added some missing file dependencies for the pds_rimage.x entry (mach.h).

noao$mtlocal/camera/rcamera.h,cam_keywords.x
    Davis, October 11, 1988
    Some minor modifications were made to the camera header reader to
    suport the infrared array header parameters. Additional images types
    (numbers 32 to 44) were added to the image type list, a new parameter
    IRBSCALE as added to the iraf header and a switch to allow for
    millisecond integration times was added.

noao$mtlocal/cyber/t_ridsout.x
    Two bugs were fixed in the ridsout task.  Double precision values of 
    airmass, starting lambda and delta lambda were being printed to stdout 
    as reals, with a pargr.  This was noticed on the SUN.  These values 
    were however, being written to the header correctly.  The second bug 
    was that negative pixel values were being read incorrectly.  The
    leading minus sign caused them to fill the 10 character field width
    without whitespace separating them from the next value.  Ridsout was
    using 'gargr' to parse the text string into pixel values, which requires
    whitespace.  Both the negative pixel and the pixel that followed were 
    being read incorrectly.                             (ShJ 29/12/87)

noao$mtlocal/camera/cam_keywords.x,cam_rheader.x
    Davis, Dec 17, 1987
    Fixed a bug in the call to bitpak for the fringe scaling parameter.
    The first argument n bitpak was expecting an integer and was receiving
    a short. This had so far only caused problems on the sun 4.

noao$mtlocal/camera/cam_keywords.x,cam_rheader.x
    Davis, May 21, 1987
    There was a bug in computing -ve decs which only showed up on SUN
    iraf. A char constant (integer) was being passed to a char array,
    so that the -ve sign was not being printed out. While fixing this
    bug I noticed a potential problem for decs in the 0 to -1 degree
    range and fixed that.

noao$mtlocal/camera/cam_rheader.x
    Davis, May 7, 1987
    Rcamera has been modified to print an error message if the header record
    is not 1026 bytes long. This modification will only work on tape input.

noao$mtlocal/r2df/r2dfrhdr.x
noao$mtlocal/r2df/r2df.h
    Davis, April 2, 1987
    An integer overflow was occuring in r2dfrhdr on the Steward mv10000.
    Two shorts were being multiplied together with the result being greater
    than MAX_SHORT.  This was implicit in the definition of NRECS. I removed
    the NRECS definition from the task .h file and forced the computation
    of NRECS to be integer. This error would only occur when the lo+
    option was used.

noao$mtlocal/cyber/cy_keywords.x
noao$mtlocal/idsmtn/wkeywords.x
    Hammond, March 28, 1987
    Tasks RIDSMTN and RIDSFILE were writing real values to the image header
    user area with only 3 digits of precision.  These files had not been
    updated since mtlocal$lib/addcards.x was changed to output real values
    with a %g rather than a %f format.  (See Oct 27 note below.)  An argument
    passed to addcard_r that was previously interpreted as the number of
    decimal places was now being interpreted as the number of digits of
    precision.  Keywords WPC, W0 and the COEFF array written by RIDSMTN
    were affected by this error; keywords WPC, W0 and AIRMASS written by 
    RIDSFILE were also.

noao$mtlocal/pds/pds_rpixels
    Davis, March 5, 1987
    A minor change was made to pds_rpixels to overcome an apparent compiler
    (not optimizer) error on the Sun. A do loop limit parameter was being
    overwritten.

noao$mtlocal/cyber/rrcopy/rc_rbits.x
    Hammond, March 2, 1987
    An error in the RCOPY task has been fixed.  The error was seen when 
    reading IPPS rasters with 12 or 20 bit integer pixels.  30 bit pixels
    were not affected.

    The WIDSOUT task has been archived (Tape 2977 - J. Barnes) and removed
    as obsolete.  The package was modified to remove this task.

noao$mtlocal/camera/t_rcamera.x: Davis, Jan 20, 1987:
    The rcamera task has been modified to accept input from a list
    of disk files as well as a list of tape files. This should facilitate
    transfers over the ethernet.

noao$mtlcoal/pds/t_pdsread.x: Davis, Jan 20, 1987
    The rpds task has been modified to  accept input from a list of
    disk files as well as a list of tape files. This should facilitate
    transfers over the ethernet.

noao$mtlocal/camera/cam_keywords.x: Davis, Jan 12, 1987
    I changed the pargc calls inside the cam_hmscard procedure to pargstr
    calls. A character constant which was stored as an integer was being
    passed to a routine which expected a char. This bug only showed up on the
    SUN and would cause extra 0's and slashes to be encoded in the dec, ra etc
    strings.

noao$mtlocal/pds/t_pdsread.x: Davis, Dec 2, 1986
    The file list parameters was being set to the NULL string when a pds
    file was read from disk. The decode_ranges procedure did not detect
    this as an error causing the program to loop over the same file
    indefinitely.

noao$mtlocal/camera/cam_keywords.x: Davis, Oct 27, 1986
    I changed the defined constant CENTURY in cam_ymdcard to 100 from 1900.
    The current year was being computed as mod (year, CENTURY) and would
    have been inaccurate after year 2000. Also removed the mod declaration.
    These changes were found in the AOS port.

noao$mtlocal/pds/pds_rheader.x: Davis, Oct 27, 1986
    The intrinsic function mod was being called with mismatched type
    arguments one octal constant and one short. The octal constant was
    being converted to an integer. Changed both to type short.
    Detected in the AOS port.

noao$mtlocal/lib/addcards.x: Hammond, Oct 27, 1986
    Header cards containing real values are now written with a %g format
    rather than %f.

noao$mtlocal/cyber/cyber.h, t_ridsfile.x, cy_keywords.x: Hammond, Sep2, 1986
    A field in the RIDSFILE data structure was named POINTER, which
    is a reserved keyword that gets translated to 'int'.  It has been
    renamed POINT.  The bug was discovered in Doug's port of IRAF to
    DAO's Alliant; it was apparently not a problem on the Vax's.

noao$mtlocal/r2df/r2dfrhdr.x: Davis, Aug19, 1986
    R2DF was not decoding the header record correctly on the SUN
    machines. The header parameters were not being byte-swapped
    correctly when BYTE_SWAP2 == NO.

noao$mtlocal/cyber/t_ridsfile.x, cy_keywords.x:  Hammond, Jul23, 1986
    To accomodate the following mod to WIDSTAPE, task RIDSOUT 
    has been changed to deal with INDEF's in the UT and ST fields.  

onedspec$t_widstape.x: Hammond, Jul23, 1986
    Task WIDSTAPE was generating an overflow error in images that
    did't have header entries for ST and UT.  These entries were
    not being changed from their preset value of INDEFR and then 
    were multiplied by 3600, causing the overflow.

__________________________________________________________________________


From Davis July 7, 1986:

1. A byte-swapping error in the header reading code of RCAMERA was fixed.
The bytes of the 256 header parameters were not being swapped correctly
on the SUN. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis June 23, 1986:

1. A new task R2DF has been added to the MTLOCAL package. R2DF was
written at CTIO to read 2D-frutti data tapes. A few modification were
made in the CTIO code: 1) the header now prints out correctly 2) the
CCD picture number is printed out as a short integer 3) a lot of
extraneous code dealing with image lists was removed.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis May 22, 1986:

1. All records written to the image user area will now be blocked to 80
characters instead of being of variable length. This change was made to
facilitate the implementation of the image database facilities.
The affected tasks are RCAMERA, RIDSFILE, RIDSMTN, and RIDSOUT.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Hammond Apr 21, 1986:

Task RIDSMTN can now add an offset to the output filename, so a continuous
sequence of filenames can be generated over more than one night's data.
This was not previously being done correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Apr 17, 1986:

Changed boolean == false constructs in files t_wcardimage.x and t_reblock.x
to ! boolean.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Apr 4, 1986:

The format of the RCAMERA DATE-OBS parameter has been changed form
dd-mm-yyyy to dd/mm/yyyy to bring it into conformity with FITS standard.

___________________________________________________________________________

From Davis Mar 9, 1986:

The order of the REBLOCK parameters  outfiles and file_list has been switched
in order to preserve the correct command line sequence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Mar 3, 1986:

The error checking in WFITS has been corrected so that WFITS terminates if
it encounters a file write error instead of continuing to the next file
as done previously.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Feb 19, 1986:

1. Rfits and rpds have been fixed so that attempting to delete the last
empty image does not generate a cannot delete protected file message.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Feb 3, 1986:

1. A mysterious bug in which the date of observation card would sometimes
not appear in the header has been fixed. A newline was missing from the
proceeding header card.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Jan 16, 1986:

1. Wfits no longer needs write permission to work. However as a consequence
wfits no longer updates the image min and max.

2. The scaling routines in rfits and wfits fits have been replaced by
appropriate vector operators.

3. The coordinate transformation parameters are now stored in the user
area and are available to hedit, imgets etc.

4. Scaled data is now read into real images regardless of the value of
bitpix. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Jan. 5, 1986:

1. Rfits, rpds and rcamera now open dev$null instead of a temporary disk
file for option make_image = no. This eliminates a lot od disk access overhead
and should speed up these readers considerably.

2. The default parameter options are now long_header=no and short_header=yes.
Setting the long_header parameter to yes will over-ride the short header
parameter.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Davis Dec. 3, 1985:

1. Rcamera will now print and store the header parameters ccdpicno and airmass
if defined.

2. A bug in the fringe scaling parameter calculation in rcamera was fixed.
Currently the mountain programs store this number in floating point format.
This will be changed in future necessitating a corresponding change in
rcamera.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Hammond Oct. 29, 1985:

1. Installed task rtextimage.  The source code shares subdirectory 
imtext with wtextimage. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
From Valdes Oct. 10, 1985:

1.  Defined widstape from ONEDSPEC package in the DATAIO package.  The
source and executable, however, still reside in ONEDSPEC (x_onedutil.e).
Widstape and widsout should be combined and the source put in DATAIO
at some point.
