generic$generic.cl
generic$generic.men
generic$cosmicrays.par	-
    Removed the cosmicrays task which is now in crutil.  (6/12/02, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

generic$mkpkg
    Added missing <error.h> dependency for flat1d.x  (12/13/01, MJF)

generic$normalize.cl
generic$normalize.par	-
    Rewrote as modern cl procedure script with possiblity to extend to
    MEF extensions.  (5/13/99, Valdes)

generic$flatten.cl
generic$normalize.cl
    Changed use of FILES for image list expansion to SECTIONS.
    (5/13/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.1

generic$normalize.cl
generic$normflat.cl
    Added CCDMEAN = 1 to final image header.  (4/16/93, Valdes)

generic$flat1d.x
generic$doc/flat1d.hlp
    CCDMEAN is set to 1.  (3/15/93, Valdes)

V2.10.2

V2.10.1

V2.10.0

V2.10

generic$flatten.par
    Changed the default values of the keeplog and logfile parameters from
    ")_.keeplog" and ")_.logfile" to ")generic.keeplog" and ")generic.logfile" 
    respectively. This change avoids a parameter redirection in the irred
    package. (8/26/91 LED)

generic$darksub.cl
    Included all parameters in IMARITH calls due to complaint about title
    being changed.  (12/9/91)

====
V2.9
====

generic$normalize.cl
generic$normflat.cl
generic$normalize.par
generic$normflat.par
    Modified use of IMSTATISTICS for additional fields parameter.  If the
    user redefined the defaults for IMSTAT then NORMALIZE and NORMFLAT
    will fail.  (11/30/89, Valdes)

generic$flatten.par
generic$normalize.par
generic$normflat.par
    Change parameter reference from )generic. to )_. to allow defining
    tasks in other packages.

generic$darksub.cl
    The last change caused the nscan to have the wrong value causing an
    improper error (exposure time for ... not found).  The value of nscan()
    is now saved before scanning the output list which must be done before
    any error breaks to avoid out of sync lists.  (7/1/88 Valdes)

generic$darksub.cl
    The fscan on the output list must immediately follow the fscan on the
    input list to prevent the lists getting out of sync.  (2/4/88 Valdes)

generic$cosmicrays.par	+
generic$generic.cl
generic$generic.men
    Added link to COSMICRAY program in CCDRED. (12/11/87 Valdes)

generic$flat1d.x:  Valdes, July 3, 1986
    1.  FLAT1D modified to use new ICFIT package.

=========================================
STScI Pre-release and 1st SUN 2.3 Release
=========================================

generic$darksub.cl:  Valdes, April 8, 1986
    1.  DARKSUB rewritten to use exposure times from the image headers and
	to allow input and output images.

===========
Release 2.2
===========

From Valdes Feb 12, 1986:

1.  The GENERIC package script was inadvertently defining CMDSTR which
was moved to the SYSTEM package.  This caused MKSCRIPT to fail if
and only if GENERIC was loaded.  This has now been fixed.
------
From Valdes Feb 10, 1986:

1.  The scripts DARKSUB, NORMFLAT, and NORMALIZE have been changed so
that calls to IMCOPY have VERBOSE=NO when dealing with temporary images.
Previously, output from imcopy was being printed but, of course, the
temporary image filenames were meaningless to the user.
------
From Valdes Nov 7, 1985:

1.  The generally useful task MKSCRIPT has been moved to the system
package.
------
From Valdes Nov 1, 1985:

1.  A general image reduction tool for creating command scripts has
been added.  The task is called MKSCRIPT.  See the help page for
this task.  An improved version of this task may eventually replace
MKSCRIPT as a system task.  (As a technical detail a hidden task CMDSTR
used by MKSCRIPT has also been added)
------
From Valdes Oct 17, 1985:

1.  Flat1d and background now allow averaging of image lines or columns
when interactively setting the fitting parameters.  The syntax is
"Fit line = 10 30"; i.e.  blank separated line or column numbers.  A
single number selects just one line or column.  Be aware however, that
the actual fitting of the image is still done on each column or line
individually.

2.  The zero line in the interactive curve fitting graphs has been removed.
This zero line interfered with fitting data near zero.
------
From Valdes Oct 4, 1985:

1.  Flat1d and background modified to allow lower and upper rejection
limits and rejection iteration.  This means the parameter file has changed.
------
From Valdes Oct 1, 1985:

1.  Task revisions renamed to revs.
-----
From Valdes on August 26, 1985:

1.  Flat1d was modified to eliminate fitting of lines or columns in which
all the data is below minflat.  Also if all the data is greater than minflat
then the ratio is computed without checking each data point which is more
efficient (particularly with the vector operators).  Thus, flat1d should
be somewhat faster; particularly for applications like multi-slits where
many parts of the data are less than minflat.

------
From Valdes on August 7, 1985:

1.  Flat1d and background have new parameters to select the graphics
output device and the graphics cursor input.

2.  Flat1d and background (fit1d) have been recompiled to use the "improved"
icfit and gtools packages.

------
From Valdes on July 26, 1985:

1.  Help page available for flat1d.

2.  Background has been modified to use new fit1d task.  It now does
column backgrounds without transposes and allows image sections.

------
From Valdes on July 25, 1985:

1.  A new task called flat1d replaces lineflat and colflat.  It is
essentially the same as lineflat except for an extra parameter "axis"
which selects the axis along which the 1D functions are to be fit.
Axis 1 is lines and axis 2 is columns.  The advantages of this change are:

	a.  Column fitting is done without transposing the image.
	b.  The colflat script using image transpositions would not
	    work the same as lineflat when used with sections.  Now
	    it is possible to mosaic several flat fields as need with
	    multiple slits or apertures.
	c.  Because no transpose is needed and it is not a script
	    flat1d should work faster than colflat.
	d.  The prompts for interactive fitting are now correct when
	    doing column fits.

------
From Valdes on July 23, 1985:

1.  The task revisions has been added to page revisions to the generic
package.  The intent is that each package will have a revisions task.
Note that this means there may be multiple tasks named revisions loaded
at one time.  Typing revisions alone will give the revisions for the
current package.  To get the system revisions type system.revisions.

2.  The tasks linebckgrnd and colbckgrnd have been combined into one
task with the extra hidden parameter "axis".  With axis=1 the task
is the same as linebckgrnd and with axis=2 the task is the same as
colbckgrnd.
