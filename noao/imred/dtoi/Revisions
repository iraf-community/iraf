imred$dtoi/spotlist.x	7 Sept, 1989 SRo
	In Suzanne's absence, removed the divide by nfog fog images in
	hd_fogcalc() after a bug report by Steve Majewski that when multiple
	fog images are used, the resultant fog values are too low by 1/nfog.
	The total_pix accumulator is already a total for all images.  Should
	be verified by Suzanne on her return.

imred$dtoi/hdicfit/hdicgdelte.x  17 April, 1989 ShJ
	Procedure icg_dl1 was declared as an integer procedure, although
	it does not return a function values and was not being called
	as a function.  

imred$dtoi/hdicfit/hdicgcolon.x  27 March, 1989 ShJ
	Changed only a comment line, to point out that the :ebars command
	switches the meaning of the error bars between representing 
	standard deviations or weights.  

imred$dtoi/spotlist.x 11 May, 1988 ShJ
	Added parameter "option", which selects a mean or median calculation
	of spot densities and the fog value.  Previously, only a mean 
	calculation was available.  The choice of "option" is written to
	the database.  

imred$dtoi/hd_aravr.x  11 May, 1988 ShJ
	This is a new file, modified from the vops version only in that it
	puts an upper limit on the number of iterations allowed in the
	procedure of 10.  This should avoid the problem reported by
	Steve Majewski of nearly saturated pixels "hanging"; they actually
	were oscillating endlessly in the mean rejection calculation.

imred$dtoi/hdtoi.x 11 May, 1988 ShJ
	Added parameter "option", which selects a mean or median calulcation
	of the fog value, in those cases where the user supplies a fog 
	image, rather than a fog value.  Previously, only a mean calculation
	was available.  This newly calculated value of fog is now also
	written to the database.

imred$dtoi/hdtoi.x 5 April, 1988 ShJ
	Modified the way in which hdtoi scales intensities to the "ceiling"
	parameter.  A maximum intensity is calculated, using cveval to
	evaluate the transformed value of the maximum density above fog.
	The fog value subtracted is hdtoi.fog, which may or may not
	equal the value of fog written by spotlist into the database.
	Previously, the program was incorrectly subtracting the spotlist
	fog value from the maximum density when calculating the maximum
	intensity and so the scale factor to represent saturated intensities
	as "ceiling". 

imred$dtoi/hdicgundel.x	25 March, 1988  ShJ
	Procedures icg_u1d and icg_undeleted in this source file were
	declared as functions but not returning a value.  They were not
	being called as functions, and are now not declared as functions.

imred$dtoi/database.x	14 March, 1988	ShJ
	Added procedure to put a double precision value:  ddb_putd().

imred$dtoi/spotlist.x	14 March, 1988	ShJ
	Added code for additional input parameter: "maxad", the maximum
	allowed input value, i.e., the AD units in a saturated pixel.  From
	this value and the "scale" parameter, spotlist calculates the
	maximum permissable density, and writes this to the database as a
	double precision value. 

imred$dtoi/hdfit.x	14 March, 1988	ShJ
	Parameter "maxden" was removed, as this value is now calculated
	precisely by spotlist and can be read from the database.

imred$dtoi/spotlist.par
imred$dtoi/hdfit.par
imred$dtoi/doc/spotlist.hlp
imred$dtoi/doc/hdfit.hlp	14 March, 1988	ShJ
	Modified help pages and parameter files for spotlist and hdfit to
	support the above changes to the user interface.

imred$dtoi/hdtoi.x	11 March, 1988	ShJ
	Bug fixed in hd_aptrans().  The equations for the k75 and k50 
	transformations were incorrect, having a '*' where a '+' should
	have been.  Also, the strncmp procedure was only checking the first 
	character to distinguish between transformation types, in which
	case k75 and k50 would not be resolved.

imred$dtoi/hdfit.x	10 March, 1988	ShJ
	Repaired an error in incrementing an offset into the output
	arrays in hd_rdloge.   This error was seen only when more than
	two databases contributed input values to be fit.  This was
	a trivial arithmetic error that had been overlooked due to
	insufficient testing.  This bug would produce a memory error
	as values were written into unallocated locations.

imred$dtoi/hdicfit/hdic.com	9 March, 1988	ShJ
	Reordered the values in the common block, as the largest double
	precision value was following the integers.  The SUN-4 compiler
	gave warning of this, then padded the double value.  Also at this
	time file hdicgundelete.x was renamed to hdicgundel.x to avoid
	problems associated with filenames longer than 14 characters.  The 
	hdicfit library was completely rebuilt at this time, to insure the
	new object module would be retrieved.
