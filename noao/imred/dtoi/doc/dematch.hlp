NAME
dematch -- match density to log exposure values
.ih
USAGE
dematch database 
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls database
Database containing density list, probably from \fIspotlist\fR.
.le
.ls wedge = "", filter = "", emulsion = ""
Information used to retrieve log exposure values from \fBwedgefile\fR.
.le
.ls wedgefile = "noao$lib/hdwedge.dat"
Name of file containing wedge intensity information.
.le
.ls nskip = 0
Number of faint spots skipped, used as an offset into the list of
log exposure values.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print the log exposure information to STDOUT as well as to \fBdatabase\fR.
.le

DESCRIPTION
Task \fIdematch\fR matches density values to log exposure values.  A database
of density values is input, as well as information needed to 
retrieve log exposure values from a reference file.  The two sources of 
information are matched, and the matching log exposure values are added 
as a record in the database.

Parameter \fBnskip\fR tells how many faint spots were not
included in the density \fBdatabase\fR.  This information is
used to align the density, exposure values.  It doesn't matter if the 
densities are listed in a monotonically increasing or decreasing
order, as long as no spots were omitted between the first and last
measured.

EXAMPLES
Match densities in db1 to log exposure values for wedge#117
with a IIIAJ emulsion and a GG385 filter.
