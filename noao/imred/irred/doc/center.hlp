NAME
center -- compute accurate centers for a list of objects
.ih
USAGE
center image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images containing the objects to be centered.
.le
.ls coords = ""
The list of text files containing initial coordinates for the objects to
be centered. Objects are listed in coords one object per line with the
initial coordinate values in columns one and two. The number of coordinate
files must be zero, one, or equal to the number of images.
If coords is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then an
coords file name of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed and
searched for, where dir is the directory, root is the root image name,
extension is "coo" and version is the next available version number for the
file.
.le
.ls output = "default"
The name of the results file or results directory. If output is
"default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then an output file name
of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is the
directory, root is the root image name, extension is "ctr" and version is
the next available version number for the file. The number of output files
must be zero, one, or equal to the number of image files.  In both interactive
and batch mode full output is written to output. In interactive mode
an output summary is also written to the standard output.
.le
.ls plotfile = ""
The name of the file containing radial profile plots of the stars written
to the output file. If plotfile is defined then a radial profile plot
is written to plotfile every time a record is written to \fIoutput\fR.
The user should be aware that this can be a time consuming operation.
.le
.ls datapars = ""
The name of the file containing the data dependent parameters.
The critical parameters \fIfwhmpsf\fR and \fIsigma\fR are located in
datapars.  If datapars is undefined then the default parameter set in 
uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls centerpars = ""
The name of the file containing the centering algorithm parameters.
The critical parameters \fIcalgorithm\fR and \fIcbox\fR are located in
centerpars. If centerpars is undefined then the default parameter
set in uparm is used.
.le
.ls interactive = yes
Interactive or non-interactive mode?
.le
.ls radplots = no
If \fIradplots\fR is "yes" and CENTER is run in interactive mode, a radial
profile of each star is plotted on the screen after the center is fit.
.le
.ls icommands = ""
The image display cursor or image cursor command file. 
.le
.ls gcommands = ""
The graphics cursor or graphics cursor command file.
.le
.ls wcsin = "logical", wcsout = "logical"
The coordinate system of the input coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR and
of the output coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR respectively. The image
header coordinate system is used to transform from the input coordinate
system to the "logical" pixel coordinate system used internally,
and from the internal "logical" pixel coordinate system to the output
coordinate system. The input coordinate system options are "logical", "tv",
"physical", and "world". The output coordinate system options are "logical",
"tv", and "physical". The image cursor coordinate system is assumed to
be the "tv" system.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current image.
The  logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by the image
input/output routines to access the image data on disk. In the logical
coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a  2D image, e.g.
dev$ypix  and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are
always (1,1).
.le
.ls tv  
Tv coordinates are the pixel coordinates used by the display servers. Tv
coordinates  include  the effects of any input image section, but do not
include the effects of previous linear transformations. If the input
image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a 
2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]
are (1,1) and (200,200) respectively.
.le
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates invariant  with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image data.  For example, if the current image
was created by extracting a section of another image,  the  physical
coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical
coordinates will be different.  In the physical coordinate system the
coordinates of the first pixel of a 2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D
image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are (1,1) and (200,200)
respectively.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant
with respect to linear transformations of the physical image data. For
example, the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter
how the image is linearly transformed. The units of input world coordinates
must be the same as those expected by the image header wcs, e. g. 
degrees and degrees for celestial coordinate systems.
.le
The wcsin and wcsout parameters default to the values of the package
parameters of the same name. The default values of the package parameters
wcsin and wcsout are "logical" and "logical" respectively. 
.le
.ls cache = no
Cache the image pixels in memory. Cache may be set to "yes", or "no".
By default cacheing is 
disabled.
.le
.ls verify = yes
Verify the critical parameters in non-interactive mode ? Verify may be set to
or "no".
.le
.ls update = no
Update the critical parameters in non-interactive mode if \fIverify\fR is
set to yes? Update may be set to "yes" or "no".
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print messages on the terminal in non-interactive mode ? Verbose may be set
to "yes" or "no".
.le
.ls graphics = ")_.graphics"
The default graphics device.
Graphics may be set to the apphot package parameter value (the default), "yes",
or "no".
.le
.ls display = ")_.display"
The default display device.  Display may be set to the apphot package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no". By default graphics overlay
is disabled.  Setting display to one of "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy"
enables graphics overlay with the IMD graphics kernel.  Setting display to
"stdgraph" enables CENTER to work interactively from a contour plot.

DESCRIPTION
CENTER computes accurate centers for a set of objects in the IRAF image
\fIimage\fR, whose initial coordinates are read from the image display cursor, 
from the text file \fIcoords\fR, or from a cursor command file.
The computed x and y coordinates, the errors,  and the fitting parameters
are written to the text file \fIoutput\fR.

The coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR are assumed to be in coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsin\fR. The options are "logical", "tv", "physical",
and "world" and the transformation from the input coordinate system to
the internal "logical" system is defined by the image coordinate system.
The simplest default is the "logical" pixel system. Users working on with
image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" input coordinate systems.
Users importing coordinate lists in world coordinates, e.g. ra and dec,
must use the "world" coordinate system and may need to convert their
equatorial coordinate units from hours and degrees to degrees and degrees first.

The coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR are in the coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsout\fR. The options are "logical", "tv",
and "physical". The simplest default is the "logical" system. Users
wishing to correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in
image sections or mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" coordinate systems.

If \fIcache\fR is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If cacheing
is enabled and CENTER is run interactively the first measurement will appear
to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the measurement
is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because CENTER
is accessing memory not disk. The point of cacheing is to speed up random
image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
sparse cacheing may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
present there is no point in enabling cacheing for images that are less than
or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
effect of cacheing in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
of objects in the top and bottom halves of the image are alternated.

CENTER can be run either interactively or in batch mode by setting the
parameter \fIinteractive\fR. In interactive mode starting x and y positions
can either be read directly from the image cursor or read from the text
file \fIcoords\fR. In interactive mode the user can examine, adjust, and
save the algorithm parameters, change ojects interactively, query for
the next or nth object in the list, or fit the entire coordinate list with
the chosen parameter set.  In batch mode the positions can be read from the
text file \fIcoords\fR or the image cursor can be redirected to a text file
containing a list of cursor commands as specified by the parameter
\fIicommands\fR.

ALGORITHMS

Descriptions of the data dependent parameters and the centering
algorithm parameters can be found in the online manual pages for
\fIdatapars\fR and \fIcenterpars\fR.

.ih
OUTPUT

In interactive mode the following quantities are written to the terminal
as each object is measured. Error is a simple string which indicates
whether an error condition has been flagged.  The centers and their errors are
in pixel units.

.nf
	image  xinit  yinit  xcenter  ycenter  xerr  yerr  error
.fi

In both interactive and batch mode the full output is written to the
text file \fIoutput\fR. At the beginning of each file is a header
listing the current values of the parameters when the first stellar
record was written. These parameters can be subsequently altered.
For each star measured the following record is written

.nf
	image  xinit  yinit  id  coords  lid
	   xcenter  ycenter  xshift  yshift  xerr  yerr  cier error
.fi

Image and coords are the name of the image and coordinate file respectively.
Id and lid are the sequence numbers of stars in the output and coordinate
files respectively. Cier and error are the centering error code and accompanying
error message respectively.  Xinit, yinit, xcenter, ycenter, xshift, yshift,
and xerr, yerr are self explanatory and output in pixel units. The sense of
the xshift and yshift definitions is the following.

.nf
	xshift = xcenter - xinit
	yshift = ycenter - yinit
.fi

In interactive mode a radial profile of each measured object is plotted
in the graphics window if \fIradplots\fR is "yes".

In interactive and batchmode a radial profile plot is written to
\fIplotfile\fR  if it is defined each time the result of an object
measurement is written to \fIoutput\fR .

.ih
ERRORS

If the object centering was error free then the field cier will be zero.
Non-zero values in the cier column flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0        # No error
	101      # The centering box is off the image
	102      # The centering box is partially off the image
	103      # The S/N ratio is low in the centering box
	104      # There are two few points for a good fit
	105      # The x or y center fit is singular
	106      # The x or y center fit did not converge
	107      # The x or y center shift is greater than maxshift
	108      # There is bad data in the centering box
.fi

BUGS

It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the image displayed
in the image display is the same as the image specified by the image parameter.

Commands which draw to the image display are disabled by default.
To enable graphics overlay on the image display, set the display
parameter to "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" to get red, green,
blue or yellow overlays and set the centerpars mkcenter switch to
"yes". It may be necessary to run gflush and to redisplay the image
to get the overlays position correctly.
