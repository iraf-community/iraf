irred$irred.cl
irred$mosproc.cl
    1. The irred cl script was modified to reference nproto instead of proto.
    2. The irred script was modified to load the core proto package in order to
       pick up the bscale task.
    3. The references to the apselect task were replace by references to the
       txdump task.
    4. The bscale.par file was removed since one cannot have private copies
       of .par files across package boundaries.
    5. Replaced the obsolete version of datapars.par with the new version.
    6. Replaced the obsolate versions of irmosaic.par, iralign.par,
       irmatch1d.par, and irmatch2d.par with new ones.
