irred$irred.cl
    The IRLINCOR task was mistakenly declared using 'x_irred.x' instead
    of 'x_irred.e'.  Works fine under the CL but broke Pyraf  (1/18/07, MJF)

irred$center.par
irred$doc/center.hlp
    Updated the center task parameter file to support the new cache, wcsin,
    and wcsout parameters.

    Added a copy of the center task help page so it is accessible even
    if apphot is not loaded. Center1d gets picked up instead in that case.

irred$mosproc.cl
    Changed the outtype parameter setting in the imcombine task call from
    "" to "real". Added default values for the rejmask, nkeep, and snoise
    parameters.

irred$irred.cl
irred$mosproc.cl
    1. The irred cl script was modified to reference nproto instead of proto.
    2. The irred script was modified to load the core proto package in order to
       pick up the bscale task.
    3. The references to the apselect task were replace by references to the
       txdump task.
    4. The bscale.par file was removed since one cannot have private copies
       of .par files across package boundaries.
    5. Replaced the obsolete version of datapars.par with the new version.
    6. Replaced the obsolate versions of irmosaic.par, iralign.par,
       irmatch1d.par, and irmatch2d.par with new ones.
