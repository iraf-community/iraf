NAME
quadsplit -- Split quadformat data into single amplifier images
.ih
USAGE
quadsplit input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Image name of \fIquadformat\fR image to be split.  This task does not
allow a list of input names.
.le
.ls output = ""
Output root name to which the AMPLIST amplifier identifiers will be
appended to form the split images.  If no output name is given then
the input name is used as the root name.
.le
.ls clobber = yes
Clobber any existing images?
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Images in "quadformat" (see help topic \fBquadformat\fR) are separated
into images containing data from only one amplifier.  The output images
have a common root name and then an extension given by the amplifier
labels in the AMPLIST keyword.  The output root name may be specified
or default to the input name.

In addition to producing the individual images keywords, are added that
are understood by the standard \fBccdproc\fR task for single amplifier
CCD reductions.

The task \fBquadjoin\fR may be used to rejoin images that were split
by this task.
