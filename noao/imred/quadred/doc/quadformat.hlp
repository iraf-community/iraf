NAME
quadformat - Description of the special multi-amplifier CCD format
.ih
DESCRIPTION
CCDs may be readout from multiple amplifiers at the same time to increase
the readout speed.  This produces multiple images of rectangular regions in
the full CCD exposure.  The amplifier readout images may be recorded in
various ways.  One way is as extensions in a multiextension FITS file.
This type of format can be reduced using the MSCRED package.

Another way is to paste the regions into a single two-dimensional image.
This, along with specific keywords to describe the locations of the
regions, constitutes the \fIquadformat\fR format described here and used by the
QUADRED package.  The term "quad" originates from the possibility of using
four amplifiers in quadrants but the format also includes any other
number of amplifiers.

It is important to realize that this is a special format only as long as
the overscan or prescan data is included in the image data.  Once this
information is used and removed as part of the processing the resulting
image can be treated in the same way as a single amplifier CCD image.
However, the image can still contain the format keywords allowing the
regions from the different amplifiers to be identified and extracted as
needed.

The \fIquadformat\fR consists of a single 2D image for a single CCD
exposure.  The image storage format may be any standard image type such
as imh or fits.  Within the image are regions containing the CCD
pixel data and regions containing overscan or prescan, which we will
call bias regions, for each amplifier.  The \fIquadformat\fR requires
the bias regions to be attached to the CCD regions such that a single
rectangular region contains both.

Generally the rectangular regions are of equal size in order to sequence
the amplifiers simultaneously.  However, it is possible for the regions
to be unequal in cases of subregion readouts with certain CCD controllers.
The figure below illustrates a "dual" and "quad" readout with equal
size regions.

The areas labeled D are the data sections and those labeled B are the
bias sections.  The data and biases are match by the amplifier labels
which are 1-4 in these examples.  The combination of the data and
bias sections are called the amplifier sections.

The regions are identified in the header by various keywords.  There is
a header translation facility which allows for alternative keyword names.
Below we describe the default keyword names in the absence of a translation.
The number of regions and the amplifier labels are described by the
string keyword AMPLIST.  The value is a string of space separated
amplifier labels.  For the above four amplifier example it would be

.nf
    AMPLIST = '1 2 3 4'
.fi

For CTIO data the labels are '11  12 21 22'.   Note that the labels
are appended to rootnames so they should be relatively short. 

The amplifier labels are appended to various root names.  The important
ones define "section" keywords.  The values are image sections that
describe regions in an raster such as the image or the CCD.  The format
of a section follows the standard IRAF notation "[c1:c2,l1:l2]" where
c1 and c2 are inclusive column endpoints and l1 and l2 are inclusive
line endpoints.

The various sections are defined below.  The labels again show the default
untranslated keyword roots.

.ls ASEC
The section of the image containing the amplifier readout.  This is the
combination of the data and bias regions as shown in the figures.
.le
.ls DSEC
The section of the image containing the actual CCD data exclusive of
bias data.  In the figures these are the D regions.
.le
.ls BSEC
The section of the image containing the bias data.  In the figures these
are the B regions.
.le
.ls TSEC
The second of the image containing the useful CCD data.  This defines
a "trimming" area and lies within the data section.  It may also be
the same as the data region.  During trimming the final image will only
include the regions in the trim sections.  Note that it generally does
not make sense to trim between amplifier regions but does make sense to
trim regions at the edges of the CCD.
.le
.ls CSEC
The section of the CCD corresponding to the data section in the image.
The CCD is considered an ideal raster (without bias regions) and a
section corresponds to the pixels in the CCD.  The CCD section must be
the same size as the data section.  It is the CCD sections that define
how the amplifiers will be pieced together to form a single image
after trimming the bias region.
.le

There may be other keyword root names for things such as gains which
have the amplifier labels appended.  However, none of these are used
by the current software.  Example image headers are given
in the EXAMPLES section.

There is a limitation in the current software that the regions be recorded
without horizontal or vertical flips.  In other words, where amplifiers
from opposite corners are used some of them must be flipped by the
data acquisition system before recording then in this \fBquadformat\fR.

3.  The following is for the raw image of example 2 after it has been
processed by CCDPROC.  Note that the various bias, trim, and CCD sections are
removed.  The AMPLIST and ASEC keywords remain and may be used to split
or evaluate the individual amplifier regions with tasks such as QUADSECTIONS,
QUADSPLIT, and QSTATISTICS.
