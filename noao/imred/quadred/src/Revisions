    When using quadproc the latest CCDPROC is used with the alias QCCDPROC.
    This is to allow using the line-by-line overscan function.  Other features
    in CCDPROC would also be available.  It was too hard to update the
    quad version of CCDPROC.  (3/12/08, Valdes)

quad/qproc.cl
    For some reason the quadsplit call was commented out.  So when quadproc
    is run the pieces are not split and then the quadjoin call results in
    a divide by zero error.  The call was uncommented.  Due to my lack
    of understanding with QUAD and that multipiece CCDPROC is used which
    does not support trims, the quadsplit with trimming is not used.
