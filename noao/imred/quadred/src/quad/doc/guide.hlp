1. Introduction

     This guide provides a brief description of the \fBquad\fR package including
examples of its use for reducing simple CCD data. The \fBquad\fR package 
contains all the basic tasks necessary for the reduction of CCD data obtained
using the CTIO array controller Arcon. It is based on the IRAF CCD reduction
package \fBccdred\fR written by Frank Valdes. It incorporates a few special
tasks needed to deal with the peculiarities of Arcon data but most of the
routines are taken directly from the standard package. The way in which one
uses the routines and the basic reduction recipe is unchanged.

This guide is generic in that it is not tied to any particular type of data.
There may be more specific guides (or "cookbooks") for your data. Detailed
descriptions of the tasks and features of the package are provided in the help
documentation for the package.

With Arcon the CCD is often readout using four ("quad") or two ("dual")
amplifiers in order to reduce readout time. A feature of such images is that
each readout typically has a slightly different, DC bias level, gain, and
readout noise. As a result both zero frames and uniformly illuminated
exposures show a characteristic chequer board pattern, the sections of the
image read through each amplifier having different levels. In addition, there
will be a separate overscan strip, used to monitor the zero level, for each
readout. The location of these overscan strips in the raw frame depends on
which amplifiers are used (for more on this see \fBquadreadout\fR). Because
of these peculiarities the \fBquad\fR package must be used for the first
reduction steps, overscan correction and trimming, of multi-readout images; 
subsequent steps can be performed using \fBquad\fR or \fBccdred\fR. Either
package can be used for the complete reduction of conventional single readout
CCD images.

     The purpose of \fBquad\fR package is to provide tools for the removal of 
all the "instrumental signatures" from CCD data taken with Arcon. The standard
reduction operations are: replacement of bad columns and lines by interpolation
from neighboring columns and lines; subtraction of a bias level
determined from overscan or prescan columns or lines; subtraction of a
zero level using a zero exposure time calibration image; subtraction
of a dark count calibration image appropriately scaled to the dark time
exposure; division by a scaled flat field calibration image; division
by an iillumination image (derived from a blank sky image); subtraction
of a scaled fringe image (also derived from a blank sky image); and
trimming the image of unwanted lines or columns such as the overscan
strip.  Any set of these operations may be done simultaneously over a list of
images in a highly efficient manner.  The reduction operations are
recorded in the image header and may also be logged on the terminal and
in a log file.

     The package also provides tools for combining multiple exposures
of object and calibration images to improve the statistical accuracy of
the observations and to remove transient bad pixels.  The combining
operation scales images of different exposure times, adjusts for
variable sky background, statistically weights the images by their
signal-to-noise, and provides a number of useful algorithms for
detecting and rejecting transient bad pixels.

     Other tasks are provided for listing reduction information about
the images, deriving secondary calibration images (such as sky
corrected flat fields or iillumination correction images), and easily
setting the package parameters for different instruments.

The \fBquad\fR package also includes some tasks which can be used for the
examination of multi-readout images, prior to reducing them, by for instance
calculating simple image statistics, generating histograms, etc. 

     There are several important features provided by the \fBccdred\fR package 
underpining \fBquad\fR,  which makes the reduction of CCD images convenient;
particularly to minimize record keeping.  One of these is the ability to 
recognize the different types of CCD images.  This ability allows the user to 
select a certain class of images to be processed or listed and allows the
processing tasks to identify calibration images and process them differently 
from object images.  The standard CCD image types are \fIobject\fR,
\fIzero\fR level, \fIdark\fR count, and \fIflat\fR field.  For more on
the image types see \fBccdtypes\fR.

     The tasks can also identify the different filters (or other subset
parameter) which require different flat field images.  This means you don't
have to separate the images by filter and process each set separately.
This feature is discussed further in \fBsubsets\fR.

     The tasks keep track of the reduction steps completed on each
image and ignore images which have been processed.  This feature,
along with recognizing the image types and subsets, makes it possible to
specify all the images to a task with a wildcard template, such as
"*.imh", rather than indicating each image by name.  You will find this
extremely important with large sets of observations.

     A fundamental aspect of the package is that the processing
modifies the images.  In other words, the reduction operations are
performed directly on the image.  This "feature" further simplifies
record keeping, frees the user from having to form unique output image
names, and minimizes the amount of disk space required.  There
are two safety features in this process.  First, the modifications do
not take effect until the operation is completed on the image.  This
allows you to abort the task without messing up the image data and
protects data if the computer crashes.  The second feature is that
there is a package parameter which may be set to make a backup of the
input data with a particular prefix such as "orig" or "imdir$".  This
backup feature may be used when there is sufficient disk space, when learning
to use the package, or just to be cautious.

     In a similar effort to efficiently manage disk space, when combining
images into a master object or calibration image there is an option to
delete the input images upon completion of the combining operation.
Generally this is desirable when there are many calibration exposures,
such as zero level or flat field images, which are not used after they
are combined into a final calibration image.

     The following sections guide you through the basic use of the
\fBquad\fR package.  Only the important parameters which you might
want to change are described.  It is assumed that the support personnel
have created the necessary instrument files (see \fBinstruments\fR)
which will set the default parameters for the data you will be
reducing.  If this is not the case you may need to delve more deeply
into the details of the tasks.  Information about all the parameters
and how the various tasks operate are given in the help documentation
for the tasks and in additional special help topics.  Some useful help
documentation is indicated in the discussion and also in the
\fBReferences\fR section.
.sh
2. Getting Started

     The first step is to load \fBquad\fR.  This is done by loading
the \fBarcon\fR package, and then the \fBquad\fR package.  Loading a
package consists of typing its name. 

     When you load the \fBquad\fR package the menu of tasks or commands
is listed.  This appears as follows:

.nf
  cl> quad
      badpiximage       combine           mkillumcor        qstatistics
      ccdgroups         cosmicrays        mkillumflat       quadproc
      ccdhedit          darkcombine       mkskycor          quadscale
      ccdinstrument     flatcombine       mkskyflat         setinstrument
      ccdlist           mkfringecor       qhistogram        zerocombine
.fi

A summary of the tasks and additional help topics is obtained by typing:

.nf
    cl> help
.fi

This list and how to get additional help on specific topics is described
in the \fBReferences\fR section at the end of this guide.

     The first command to use is \fBsetinstrument\fR, which sets the package
appropriately for the CCD images to be reduced.  The support personnel
should tell you the instrument identification, but if not a list
of known instruments may be listed by using '?' for the instrument name.

.nf
    cl> setinstrument
    Instrument ID (type ? for a list) \fI<enter instrument id or ?>\fR
        <Set quad package parameters using eparam>
        <Set quadproc task parameters using eparam>
.fi

This task sets the default parameters and then allows you to modify the
package parameters and the processing parameters using the parameter
editor \fBeparam\fR.  If you are not familiar with \fBeparam\fR see the
help or CL introduction documentation.  For most terminals you move up
and down through the parameters with the terminal arrow keys, you
change the parameters by simply typing the desired value, and you exit
with control Z or control D.  Note that you can change parameters for
any task at any time with \fBeparam\fR and you do not have to run
\fBsetinstrument\fR again, even if you logout, until you need to reduce
data from a different instrument.

     The \fBquad\fR package parameters control general I/O functions of
the tasks in the package.  The parameters you might wish to change are
the output pixel type and the verbose option.  Except when the input
images are short integers, the noise is significantly greater than one
digital unit, and disk space is critical, it is probably better to
allow the processing to convert the images to real pixel datatype.  The
verbose parameter simply prints the information written to the log file
on the terminal.  This can be useful when little else is being done and
you are just beginning.  However, when doing background processing and
other IRAF reduction tasks it is enough to simply look at the end of
the logfile with the task \fBtail\fR to see the current state of the
processing.

     The \fBquadproc\fR parameters control the CCD processing.  There are
many parameters but they all may be conveniently set at this point.
Many of the parameters have default values set appropriately for the
instrument you specified.  The images to be processed can be specified
later.  What needs to be set are the processing operations that you
want done and the parameters required for each operation.  The
processing operations are selected by entering yes or no for each one.
The following items briefly describe each of the possible processing
operations and the additional parameters required.

.ls \fIfixpix\fR - Fix bad CCD lines and columns?
The bad pixels (cosmetic defects) in the detector are given in a file
specified by the parameter \fIfixfile\fR.  This information is used
to replace the pixels by interpolating from the neighboring pixels.
A standard file for your instrument may be set by \fBsetinstrument\fR
or if the word "image" is given then the file is defined in the instrument
data file.  For more on the bad pixel file see \fBinstruments\fR.
.le
.ls \fIoverscan\fR - Apply overscan strip correction?
The overscan or prescan region is specified by the parameter
\fIbiassec\fR.  This is given as an IRAF image section. For guidance on 
seting this parameter see the help page for \fBquadproc\fR. The overscan
region is averaged along the readout axis, specified by the parameter
\fIreadaxis\fR, to create a one dimensional bias vector.  This bias is
fit by a function to remove cosmic rays and noise.  There are a number
of parameters at the end of the parameter list which control the
fitting.
.le
.ls \fItrim\fR - Trim the image?
The image is trimmed to the image section given by the parameter
\fItrimsec\fR. For guidance on setting this parameter see the help page
for \fBquadproc\fR.
.le
.ls \fIzerocor\fR - Apply zero level correction?
The zero level image to be subtracted is specified by the parameter
\fIzero\fR.  If none is given then the calibration image will be sought
in the list of images to be processed.
.le
.ls \fIdarkcor\fR - Apply dark count correction?
The dark count image to be subtracted is specified by the parameter
\fIdark\fR.  If none is given then the calibration image will be sought
in the list of images to be processed.
.le
.ls \fIflatcor\fR - Apply flat field correction?
The flat field images to be used are specified by the parameter
\fIflat\fR.  There must be one flat field image for each filter
or subset (see \fBsubsets\fR) to be processed.  If a flat field
image is not given then the calibration image will be sought
in the list of images to be processed.
.le
.ls \fIreadcor\fR - Convert zero level image to readout correction?
If a one dimensional zero level readout correction vector is to be subtracted
instead of a two dimensional zero level image then, when this parameter is set,
the zero level images will be averaged to one dimension.  The readout axis
must be specified by the parameter \fIreadaxis\fR.  The default for your
instrument is set by \fBsetinstrument\fR.
.le
.ls \fIscancor\fR - Convert flat field image to scan correction?
If the instrument is operated in a scan mode then a correction to the
flat field may be required.  There are two types of scan modes, "shortscan"
and "longscan".  In longscan mode flat field images will be averaged
to one dimension and the readout axis must be specified.  Shortscan mode
is a little more complicated.  The scan correction is used if the flat
field images are not observed in scan mode.  The number of scan lines
must be specified by the parameter \fInscan\fR.  If they are observed in
scan mode, like the object observations, then the scan correction
operations should \fInot\fR be specified.  For details of scan mode operations
see \fBquadproc\fR.  The scan parameters
should be set by \fBsetinstrument\fR.  If in doubt consult someone
familiar with the instrument and mode of operation.
.le

     This description of the parameters is longer than the actual operation of
setting the parameters.  The only parameters likely to change during processing
are the calibration image parameters.

     When processing many images using the same calibration files a modest
performance improvement can be achieved by keeping (caching) the
calibration images in memory to avoid disk accesses.  This option
is available by specifying the amount of memory available for image
caching with the parameter \fImax_cache\fR.  If the value is zero then
the images are accessed from disk as needed while if there is
sufficient memory the calibration images may be kept in memory during
the task execution.
.sh
3. Processing Your Data

     The processing path depends on the type of data, the type of
instrument, types of calibration images, and the observing
sequence.  In this section we describe two types of operations common
in reducing most data; combining calibration images and performing the
standard calibration and correction operations.  Some additional special
operations are described in the following section.

     However, the first thing you might want to try before any
processing is to get a listing of the CCD images showing the CCD image
types, subsets, and processing flags.  The task for this is
\fBccdlist\fR.  It has three types of output; a short one line per
image format, a longer format which shows the state of the processing,
and a format which prints the image names only (used to create files
containing lists of images of a particular CCD image type).  To get a
quick listing type:

.nf
    cl> ccdlist *.imh
    ccd001.imh[544,512][short][unknown][V]:FOCUS L98-193
    ccd007.imh[544,512][short][object][V]:N2968 V 600s
    ccd015.imh[544,512][short][object][B]:N3098 B 500s
    ccd024.imh[544,512][short][object][R]:N4036 R 600s
    ccd045.imh[544,512][short][flat][V]:dflat 5s
    ccd066.imh[544,512][short][flat][B]:dflat 5s
    ccd103.imh[544,512][short][flat][R]:dflat 5s
    ccd104.imh[544,512][short][zero][]:bias
    ccd105.imh[544,512][short][dark][]:dark 3600s
.fi

     The example shows only a sample of the images.  The short format
listing tells you the name of the image, its size and pixel type, the
CCD image type as seen by the package, the subset identifier (in this
case the filter), and the title.  If the data had been processed then
there would also be processing flags.  If the CCD image types do not
seem right then there may be a problem with the instrument
specification.

     Many of the tasks in the \fBquad\fR package have the parameter
\fIccdtype\fR which selects a particular type of image.  To list
only the object images from the previous example:

.nf
    cl> ccdlist *.imh ccdtype=object
    ccd007.imh[544,512][short][object][V]:N2968 V 600s
    ccd015.imh[544,512][short][object][B]:N3098 B 500s
    ccd024.imh[544,512][short][object][R]:N4036 R 600s
.fi

If no CCD image type is specified (by using the null string "")
then all image types are selected.  This may be
necessary if your instrument data does not contain image type identifications.
.sh
3.1 Combining Calibration Images

     If you do not need to combine calibration images because you only
have one image of each type, you can skip this section.  Calibration
images, particularly zero level and flat field images, are combined in
order to minimize the effects of noise and reject cosmic ray hits in the
calibrations.  The basic tool for combining images is the task
\fBcombine\fR.  There are simple variants of this task whose default
parameters are set appropriately for each type of calibration image.
These are the ones you will use for calibration images leaving
\fBcombine\fR for combining object images.  Zero level images are
combined with \fBzerocombine\fR, dark count images with
\fBdarkcombine\fR, and flat field images with \fBflatcombine\fR.

     For example, to combine flat field images the command is:

.nf
    cl> flatcombine *.imh
    Jun  1 14:26 combine: maxreject
            Images      N    Exp   Mode  Scale Offset Weight
        ccd045.imh      1    5.0  INDEF  1.000     0.  0.048
        ccd046.imh      1    5.0  INDEF  1.000     0.  0.048
        	<... list of files ...>
        ccd065.imh      1    5.0  INDEF  1.000     0.  0.048
        ----------- ------ ------
         FlatV.imh     21    5.0
.fi

This output is printed when verbose mode is set.  The same information
is recorded in the log file.  In this case the flat fields are combined
by rejecting the maximum value at each point in the image (the
"maxreject" algorithm).  The images are scaled by the exposure times,
which are all the same in this example.  The mode is not evaluated for
exposure scaling and the relative weights are the same because the
exposure times are the same.  The example only shows part of the
output; \fBflatcombine\fR automatically groups the flat field images by
filter to produce the calibration images "FlatV", "FlatB", and
"FlatR".
.sh
3.2 Calibrations and Corrections

     Processing the CCD data is easy and largely automated.
First, set the task parameters with the following command:

.nf
    cl> eparam quadproc
.fi

You may have already set the parameters when you ran
\fBsetinstrument\fR, though the calibration image parameters
\fIzero\fR, \fIdark\fR, and \fIflat\fR may still need to be set or
changed.  Once this is done simply give the command

.nf
    cl> quadproc *.imh
    ccd003: Jun  1 15:13 Overscan section is [520:540,*] with mean=485.0
    ccd003: Jun  1 15:14 Trim data section is [3:510,3:510]
    ccd003: Jun  1 15:14 Overscan section is [520:540,*] with mean=485.0
    FlatV:  Jun  1 15:14 Trim data section is [3:510,3:510]
    FlatV:  Jun  1 15:15 Overscan section is [520:540,*] with mean=486.4
    ccd003: Jun  1 15:15 Flat field image is FlatV.imh with scale=138.2
    ccd004: Jun  1 15:16 Trim data section is [3:510,3:510]
    ccd004: Jun  1 15:16 Overscan section is [520:540,*] with mean=485.2
    ccd004: Jun  1 15:16 Flat field image is FlatV.imh with scale=138.2
                <... more ...>
    ccd013: Jun  1 15:22 Trim data section is [3:510,3:510]
    ccd013: Jun  1 15:23 Overscan section is [520:540,*] with mean=482.4
    FlatB:  Jun  1 15:23 Trim data section is [3:510,3:510]
    FlatB:  Jun  1 15:23 Overscan section is [520:540,*] with mean=486.4
    ccd013: Jun  1 15:24 Flat field image is FlatB.imh with scale=132.3
                <... more ...>
.fi

     The output shown is with verbose mode set.  It is the same as
recorded in the log file.  It illustrates the principle of automatic
calibration image processing.  The first object image, "ccd003", was
being processed when the flat field image was required.  Since the
image was taken with the V filter the appropriate flat field was
determined to be "FlatV".  Since it had not been processed, the
processing of "ccd003" was interrupted to process "FlatV".  The
processed calibration image may have been cached if there was enough
memory.  Once "FlatV" was processed (note that the flat field was not
flattened because the task knows this image is a flat field) the
processing of "ccd003" was completed.  The next image, "ccd004", is
also a V filter image so the already processed, and possibly cached,
flat field "FlatV" is used again.  The first B band image is "ccd013"
and, as before, the B filter flat field calibration image is processed
automatically.  The same automatic calibration processing and image
caching occurs when using zero level and dark count calibration
images.

     Commonly the processing is done with the verbose mode turned off
and the task run as a background job.  This is done with the commands

.nf
    cl> quad.verbose=no
    cl> quadproc *.imh &
.fi

The already processed images in the input list are recognized as having been
processed and are not affected.  To check the status of the processing we
can look at the end of the log file with:

.nf
    cl> tail logfile
.fi

After processing we can repeat the \fBccdlist\fR command to find:

.nf
    cl> ccdlist *.imh ccdtype=object
    ccd007.imh[508,508][real][object][V][OTF]:N2968 V 600s
    ccd015.imh[508,508][real][object][B][OTF]:N3098 B 500s
    ccd024.imh[544,512][short][object][R][OTF]:N4036 R 600s
.fi

The processing flags indicate the images have been overscan corrected,
trimmed, and flat fielded.

     As you can see, processing images is very easy.  There is one source
of minor confusion for beginning users and that is dealing with calibration
images.  First, there is no reason that calibration images
may not be processed explicitly with \fBquadproc\fR, just remember to set
the \fIccdtype\fR to the calibration image type or to "".  When processing
object images the calibration images to be used may be specified either
with the task parameter for the particular calibration image or by
including the calibration image in the list of input images.  Calibration
images specified by parameter value take precedence and the task
does not check its CCD image type.  Calibration images given in the
input list must have a valid CCD image type.  In case too many
calibration images are specified, say because the calibration images
combined to make the master calibration images were not deleted and
so are part of the image list "*.imh", only the first one will be used.
Another point to know is that flat field, iillumination, and fringe images
are subset (filter) dependent and so a calibration image for each filter
must be specified.
.sh
4. Special Processing Operations

     The special processing operations are mostly concerned with the
flat field response correction.  There are also special processing
operations available in \fBquadproc\fR for one dimensional readout
corrections in the zero level and flat field calibrations.  These
were described briefly above and in more detail in \fBquadproc\fR
and are not discussed further in this guide.  The processing
operations described in this section are for preparing flat fields
for two dimensional spectroscopic data, for correcting flat fields
for iilluminations effects, for making a separate iillumination correction,
and for applying corrections for fringe effects.  For additional
discussion about flat fields and iillumination corrections see the
help topic \fBflatfields\fR.
.sh
4.1 Spectroscopic Flat Fields

     For spectroscopic data the flat fields may have to be processed to
remove the general shape of the lamp spectrum and to replace regions outside
of the aperture where there is no flat field information with values that
will not cause bad response effects when the flat field is applied to the
data.  If the shape of the lamp spectrum is not important and if the
longslit spectra have the regions outside of the slit either off the
detector or trimmed then you may use the flat field without special
processing.

   First you must process the flat field images explicitly with

.nf
    cl> quadproc *.imh ccdtype=flat
.fi

where "*.imh" may be replaced with any list containing the flat fields.
If zero level and dark count corrections are required these calibration
images must be available at this time.

     Load the \fBtwodspec\fR package and then either the \fBlongslit\fR
package, for longslit data, or the \fBapextract\fR package, for
multiaperture data such as echelles, multifiber, or aperture mask
spectra.  The task for removing the longslit quartz spectrum is
\fBresponse\fR.  There is also a task for removing iillumination
effects, including the slit profile, from longslit spectra called
\fBiillumination\fR.  For more about processing longslit spectra see the
help for these tasks and the paper \fIReduction of Longslit Spectra
with IRAF\fR.  The cookbook \fIReduction of Longslit Spectroscopic
Data Using IRAF (KPNO ICCD and Cryogenic Camera Data)\fR also provides
a very good discussion even if your data is from a different instrument.

     For multiaperture data the task for removing the relative shapes of
the spectra is called \fBapnormalize\fR.  Again, consult the help documentation
for this task for further details.  Since you will probably also be
using the package for extracting the spectra you may be interested
in the document \fIThe IRAF APEXTRACT Package\fR.
.sh
4.2 Iillumination Corrections

     The flat field calibration images may not have the same iillumination
pattern as the observations of the sky due to the way the lamp illuminates the
optical system.  In this case when the flat field correction is applied
to the data there will be gradients in the sky background.  To remove
these gradients a blank sky calibration image is heavily smoothed
to produce an iillumination image.  The iillumination image
is then divided into the images during processing to correct for the
iillumination difference between the flat field and the objects.
Like the flat fields, the iillumination corrections images may be subset
dependent so there should be an iillumination image for each subset.

The task which makes iillumination correction images is \fBmkskycor\fR.
Some examples are

.nf
    cl> mkskycor sky004 Illum004
    cl> mkskycor sky*.imh ""
.fi

In the first example the sky image "sky004" is used to make the iillumination
correction image "Illum004".  In the second example the sky images are
converted to iillumination correction images by specifying no output image
names.  Like \fBquadproc\fR if the input images have not been processed they
are first processed automatically.

To apply the iillumination correction

.nf
    cl> quadproc *.imh ccdtype=object illumcor+ illum=Illum004
    cl> quadproc *.imh ccdtype=object illumcor+ illum=sky*.imh
.fi

The iillumination images could also be set using \fBeparam\fR or given
on the command line.
.sh
4.3 Sky Flat Fields

    You will notice that when you process images with an iillumination
correction you are dividing each image by a flat field calibration and
an iillumination correction.  If the iillumination corrections are not
done as a later step but at the same time as the rest of the processing
one will get the same calibration by multiplying the flat field by
the iillumination correction and using this product alone as the
flat field.  Such an image is called a \fIsky flat\fR since it is
a flat field which has been corrected to yield a flat sky when applied
to the observations.  This approach has the advantage of one less
calibration image and two less computations (scaling and dividing the
iillumination correction).  As an added short cut, rather than compute
the iillumination image with \fBmkskycor\fR and then multiplying, the
task \fBmkskyflat\fR does all this in one step.  Thus, \fBmkskyflat\fR
takes an input blank sky image, processes it if needed, determines the
appropriate flat field (sky flats are also subset dependent) from the
\fBquadproc\fR parameters or the input image list, and produces an
output sky flat.  Further if no output image is specified the task
converts the input blank sky calibration image into a sky flat.

     Two examples in which a new image is created and in which the
input images are converted to sky flats are

    cl> mkskyflat sky004 Skyflat
    cl> mkskyflat sky*.imh ""

4.4 Iillumination Corrected Flat Fields

     A third method to account for iillumination problems in the flat fields
is to remove the large scale pattern from the flat field itself.  This is
useful if there are no reasonable blank sky calibration images and the
astronomical exposures are evenly illuminated but the flat fields are not.
This is done by smoothing the flat field images instead of blank sky
images.  As with using the sky images there are two methods, creating
an iillumination correction to be applied as a separate step or fixing
the original flat field.  The smoothing algorithm is
the same as that used in the other tasks.  The tasks to make these types
of corrections are \fBmkillumcor\fR and \fBmkillumflat\fR.  The usage
is pretty much the same as the other iillumination correction tasks
except that it is more reasonable to replace the original flat fields
by the corrected flat fields when fixing the flat field.  Examples
of an iillumination correction and removing the iillumination pattern
from the flat field are

.nf
    cl> mkillumcor flat025 Illum025
    cl> mkillumflat flat*.imh ""
.fi

As with the other tasks, the input images are processed if necessary.

4.5 Fringe Corrections

    Some CCD detectors suffer from fringing effects due to the night
sky emission lines which are not removed by the other calibration
and correction operations.  To correct for the fringing you need a
really blank sky image.  There is not yet a task to remove objects from
sky images because this is often done with an interactive image display
tool (which will soon be added).  The blank sky image is heavily smoothed
to determine the mean sky background and then this is subtracted from the
original image.  The image should then be essentially zero except for the
fringe pattern.  This fringe correction image is scaled to the same
exposure time as the image to be corrected and then subtracted to remove
the fringing.  Note that since the night sky lines are variable there
may need to be an additional scaling applied.  Determining this scaling
requires either an interactive display tool or a very clever task.
Such tasks will also be added in the future.

     The task to make a fringe correction image is \fBmkfringecor\fR.
the sky background is determined in exactly the same way as the iillumination
pattern, in fact the same sky image may be used for both the sky
iillumination and for the fringe correction.  The task works consistently
with the "mk" tasks in that the input images are processed first if needed
and then the output correction image is produced with the specified name
or replaces the input image if no output image is specified.
As examples,

    cl> mkfringecor sky004 Fringe
    cl> mkfringecor sky*.imh ""

6. Summary

     The \fBquad\fR package is very easy to use.  First load the package;
it is in the \fBarcon\fR package.  If this is your first time reducing data
from a particular instrument or if you have changed instruments then run
\fBsetinstrument\fR. Set the processing parameters for the operations you want
performed.  If you need to combine calibration images to form a master 
calibration image use one of the combine tasks.  Spectroscopic flat fields may
need to be processed first in order to remove the lamp spectrum.
Finally, just type

.nf
    cl> quadproc *.imh&
