\fBquadformat\fR image formats.
.ih
USAGE	
ccdproc images
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
List of input CCD images to process.  The list may include processed
images and calibration images.
.le
.ls output = ""
List of output images.  If no list is given then the processing will replace
the input images with the processed images.  If a list is given it must
match the input image list.  \fINote that any dependent calibration images
still be processed in-place with optional backup.\fR
.le
.ls ccdtype = ""
CCD image type to select from the input image list.  If no type is given
then all input images will be selected.  The recognized types are described
in \fBccdtypes\fR.
.le
.ls max_cache = 0
Maximum image caching memory (in Mbytes).  If there is sufficient memory
the calibration images, such as zero level, dark count, and flat fields,
will be cached in memory when processing many input images.  This
reduces the disk I/O and makes the task run a little faster.  If the
value is zero image caching is not used.
.le
.ls noproc = no
List processing steps only?
.le

.ce
PROCESSING SWITCHES
.ls fixpix = yes
Fix bad CCD lines and columns by linear interpolation from neighboring
lines and columns?  If yes then a bad pixel mask, image, or file must be
specified.
.le
.ls overscan = yes
Apply overscan or prescan bias correction?  If yes then the overscan
image section and the readout axis must be specified.
.le
.ls trim = yes
Trim the image of the overscan region and bad edge lines and columns?
If yes then the trim section must be specified.
.le
.ls zerocor = yes
Apply zero level correction?  If yes a zero level image must be specified.
.le

zero level images are averaged across the readout axis to form one
dimensional zero level readout correction images.
.le
.ls scancor = no
Convert zero level, dark count and flat field images to scan mode flat
field images?  If yes then the form of scan mode correction is specified by
the parameter \fIscantype\fR.
.le

.ce
PROCESSING PARAMETERS
.ls readaxis = "line"
Read out axis specified as "line" or "column".
.le
.ls fixfile
Bad pixel mask, image, or file.  If "image" is specified then the name is
specified in the image header or instrument translation file.  If "BPM" is
specified then the standard BPM image header keyword defines a bad pixel
mask.  A bad pixel mask is a compact format (".pl" extension) with zero
values indicating good pixels and non-zero values indicating bad pixels.  A
bad pixel image is a regular image in which zero values are good pixels and
non-zero values are bad pixels.  A bad pixel file specifies bad pixels or
rectangular bad pixel regions as described later.  The direction of
interpolation is determined by the mask value with a value of two
interpolating across columns, a value of three interpolating across lines,
and any other non-zero value interpolating along the narrowest dimension.
.le
.ls biassec
Overscan bias strip image section.  If "image" is specified then the overscan
bias section is specified in the image header or instrument translation file.
Only the part of the bias section along the readout axis is used.  The
length of the bias region fit is defined by the trim section.  If one
wants to limit the region of the overscan used in the fit to be less
than that of the trim section then the sample region parameter,
\fIsample\fR, should be used.  It is an error if no section or the
whole image is specified.
.le
.ls trimsec
Image section for trimming.  If "image" is specified then the trim image
section is specified in the image header or instrument translation file.
However, for \fIquadformat\fR data this parameter is not used and the trim
sections are assumed to be in the image header.
.le
.ls zero = ""
Zero level calibration image.  The zero level image may be one or two
dimensional.  The CCD image type and subset are not checked for these
images and they take precedence over any zero level calibration images
given in the input list.
.le
.ls dark = ""
Dark count calibration image.  The CCD image type and subset are not checked
for these images and they take precedence over any dark count calibration
images given in the input list.
.le
.ls flat = ""
Flat field calibration images.  The flat field images may be one or
two dimensional.  The CCD image type is not checked for these
images and they take precedence over any flat field calibration images given
in the input list.  The flat field image with the same subset as the
input image being processed is selected.
.le
.ls illum = ""
Iillumination correction images.  The CCD image type is not checked for these
images and they take precedence over any iillumination correction images given
in the input list.  The iillumination image with the same subset as the
input image being processed is selected.
.le
.ls fringe = ""
Fringe correction images.  The CCD image type is not checked for these
images and they take precedence over any fringe correction images given
in the input list.  The fringe image with the same subset as the
input image being processed is selected.
.le
.ls minreplace = 1.
When processing flat fields, pixel values below this value (after
all other processing such as overscan, zero, and dark corrections) are
replaced by this value.  This allows flat fields processed by \fBccdproc\fR
to be certain to avoid divide by zero problems when applied to object
images.
.le
.ls scantype = "shortscan"
Type of scan format used in creating the CCD images.  The modes are:
.ls "shortscan"
The CCD is scanned over a number of lines and then read out as a regular
two dimensional image.  In this mode unscanned zero level, dark count and
flat fields are numerically scanned to form scanned flat fields comparable
to the observations.
.le
.ls "longscan"
In this mode the CCD is clocked and read out continuously to form a long
strip.  Flat fields are averaged across the readout axis to
form a one dimensional flat field readout correction image.  This assumes
that all recorded image lines are clocked over the entire active area of the
CCD.
.le
.le
.ls nscan
Number of object scan readout lines used in short scan mode.  This parameter
is used when the scan type is "shortscan" and the number of scan lines
cannot be determined from the object image header (using the keyword
nscanrows or it's translation).
.le

.ce
OVERSCAN FITTING PARAMETERS

There are two types of overscan (or prescan) determinations.  One determines
a independent overscan value for each line  and is only available for a
\fIreadaxis\fR of 1.  The other averages the overscan along the readout
direction to make an overscan vector, fits a smoothing function to the vector,
and then evaluate and then evaluates the smooth function at each readout
line or column.  The line-by-line determination only uses the
\fIfunction\fR parameter and the smoothing determinations uses all
the following parameters.

.ls function = "legendre"
Line-by-line determination of the overscan is specified by:

.nf
         mean - the mean of the biassec columns at each line
       median - the median of the biassec columns at each line
       minmax - the mean at each line with the min and max excluded
.fi

The smoothed overscan vector may be fit by one of the functions:

.nf
     legendre - legendre polynomial
    chebyshev - chebyshev polynomial
      spline1 - linear spline
      spline3 - cubic spline
.fi
.le
.ls order = 1
Number of polynomial terms or spline pieces in the overscan fit.
.le
.ls sample = "*"
Sample points to use in the overscan fit.  The string "*" specified all
points otherwise an \fBicfit\fR range string is used.
.le
.ls naverage = 1
Number of points to average or median to form fitting points.  Positive
numbers specify averages and negative numbers specify medians.
.le
.ls niterate = 1
Number of rejection iterations to remove deviant points from the overscan fit.
If 0 then no points are rejected.
.le
.ls low_reject = 3., high_reject = 3.
Low and high sigma rejection factors for rejecting deviant points from the
overscan fit.
.le
.ls grow = 0.
One dimensional growing radius for rejection of neighbors to deviant points.
.le
.ls interactive = no
Fit the overscan vector interactively?  If yes and the overscan function type
is one of the \fBicfit\fR types then the average overscan vector is fit
interactively using the \fBicfit\fR package.  If no then the fitting parameters
given below are used.
.le

The parameters \fIverbose\fR, \fIlogfile\fR, and \fIbackup\fR default to
the package parameters but may be specified to override the package
values.  This is used by the \fBquadproc\fR script task.  These parameters
are described in the help topic "quadred.package".
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fBCcdproc\fR processes CCD images to correct and calibrate for
detector defects, readout bias, zero level bias, dark counts,
response, iillumination, and fringing.  It also trims unwanted
lines and columns and changes the pixel datatype.  It is efficient
and easy to use; all one has to do is set the parameters and then
begin processing the images.  The task takes care of most of the
record keeping and automatically does the prerequisite processing
of calibration images.  Beneath this simplicity there is much that
is going on.  In this section a simple description of the usage is
given.  The following sections present more detailed discussions
on the different operations performed and the order and logic
of the processing steps.  For a user's guide to the \fBccdred\fR
package see \fBguide\fR.  Much of the ease of use derives from using
information in the image header.  If this information is missing
see section 13.

One begins by setting the task parameters.  There are many parameters
but they may be easily reviewed and modified using the task \fBeparam\fR.
The input CCD images to be processed are given as an image list.
Previously processed images are ignored and calibration images are
recognized, provided the CCD image types are in the image header (see
\fBinstruments\fR and \fBccdtypes\fR).  Therefore it is permissible to
use simple image templates such as "*.imh".  The \fIccdtype\fR parameter
may be used to select only certain types of CCD images to process
(see \fBccdtypes\fR).

The processing operations are selected by boolean (yes/no) parameters.
Because calibration images are recognized and processed appropriately,
the processing operations for object images should be set.
Any combination of operations may be specified and the operations are
performed simultaneously.  While it is possible to do operations in
separate steps this is much less efficient.  Two of the operation
parameters apply only to zero level and flat field images.  These
are used for certain types of CCDs and modes of operation.

The processing steps selected have related parameters which must be
set.  These are things like image sections defining the overscan and
trim regions and calibration images.  There are a number of parameters
used for fitting the overscan or prescan bias section.  These are
parameters used by the standard IRAF curve fitting package \fBicfit\fR.
The parameters are described in more detail in the following sections.

In addition to the task parameters there are package parameters
which affect \fBccdproc\fR.  These include the instrument and subset
files, the text and plot log files, the output pixel datatype,
the amount of memory available for calibration image caching,
the verbose parameter for logging to the terminal, and the backup
prefix.  These are described in \fBccdred\fR.

Calibration images are specified by task parameters and/or in the
input image list.  If more than one calibration image is specified
then the first one encountered is used and a warning is issued for the
extra images.  Calibration images specified by
task parameters take precedence over calibration images in the input list.
These images also need not have a CCD image type parameter since the task
parameter identifies the type of calibration image.  This method is
best if there is only one calibration image for all images
to be processed.  This is almost always true for zero level and dark
count images.  If no calibration image is specified by task parameter
then calibration images in the input image list are identified and
used.  This requires that the images have CCD image types recognized
by the package.  This method is useful if one may simply say "*.imh"
as the image list to process all images or if the images are broken
up into groups, in "@" files for example, each with their own calibration
frames.

When an input image is processed the task first determines the processing
parameters and calibration images.  If a requested operation has been
done it is skipped and if all requested operations have been completed then
no processing takes place.  When it determines that a calibration image
is required it checks for the image from the task parameter and then
for a calibration image of the proper type in the input list.

Having
selected a calibration image it checks if it has been processed by
looking for the image header flag CCDPROC.  If it is not present then
the calibration image is processed.  When any image has been processed
the CCDPROC flag is added.  For images processed directly by \fBccdproc\fR
the individual processing flags are checked even if the CCDPROC flag is
present.  However, the automatic processing of the calibration images is
only done if the CCDPROC flag is absent!  This is to make the task more
efficient by not having to check every flag for every calibration image
for every input image.  Thus, if additional processing
steps are added after images have been partially reduced then input images
will be processed for the new steps but calibration images will not be
processed automatically.

After the calibration images have been identified, and processed if
necessary, the images may be cached in memory.  This is done when there
are more than two input images (it is actually less efficient to
cache the calibration images for one or two input images) and the parameter
\fImax_cache\fR is greater than zero.  When caching, as many calibration
images as allowed by the specified memory are read into memory and
kept there for all the input images.  Cached images are, therefore,
only read once from disk which reduces the amount of disk I/O.  This
makes a modest decrease in the execution time.  It is not dramatic
because the actual processing is fairly CPU intensive.

Once the processing parameters and calibration images have been determined
the input image is processed for all the desired operations in one step;
i.e. there are no intermediate results or images.  This makes the task
efficient.  If a matching list of output images is given then the processed
image is written to the specified output image name.  If no output image
list is given then the corrected image is output as a temporary image until
the entire image has been processed.  When the image has been completely
processed then the original image is deleted (or renamed using the
specified backup prefix) and the corrected image replaces the original
image.  Using a temporary image protects the data in the event of an abort
or computer failure.  Keeping the original image name eliminates much of
the record keeping and the need to generate new image names.
.sh
1. Fixpix
Regions of bad lines and columns may be replaced by linear
interpolation from neighboring lines and columns when the parameter
\fIfixpix\fR is set.  This algorithm is the same as used in the
task \fBfixpix\fR.  The bad pixels may be specified by a pixel mask,
an image, or a text file.  For the mask or image, values of zero indicate
good pixels and other values indicate bad pixels to be replaced.

The text file consists of lines with four fields, the starting and
ending columns and the starting and ending lines.  Any number of
regions may be specified.  Comment lines beginning with the character
'#' may be included.  The description applies directly to the input
image (before trimming) so different files are needed for previously
trimmed or subsection readouts.  The data in this file is internally
turned into the same description as a bad pixel mask with values of
two for regions which are narrower or equal across the columns and
a value of three for regions narrower across lines.

The direction of interpolation is determined from the values in the
mask, image, or the converted text file.  A value of two interpolates
across columns, a value of three interpolates across lines, and any
other value interpolates across the narrowest dimension of bad pixels
and using column interpolation if the two dimensions are equal.

The bad pixel description may be specified explicitly with the parameter
\fIfixfile\fR or indirectly if the parameter has the value "image".  In the
latter case the instrument file must contain the name of the file.
.sh
2. Overscan
If an overscan or prescan correction is specified (\fIoverscan\fR
parameter) then the image section (\fIbiassec\fR parameter) defines
the overscan region.

There are two types of overscan (or prescan) determinations.  One determines
a independent overscan value for each line  and is only available for a
\fIreadaxis\fR of 1.  The other averages the overscan along the readout
direction to make an overscan vector, fits a smoothing function to the vector,
and then evaluate and then evaluates the smooth function at each readout
line or column.

The line-by-line determination provides an mean, median, or
mean with the minimum and maximum values excluded.  The median
is lowest value of the middle two when the number of overscan columns
is even rather than the mean.

The smoothed overscan vector determination uses the \fBicfit\fR options
including interactive fitting.  The fitting function is generally either a
constant (polynomial of 1 term) or a high order function which fits the
large scale shape of the overscan vector.  Bad pixel rejection is also
available to eliminate cosmic ray events.  The function fitting may be done
interactively using the standard \fBicfit\fR iteractive graphical curve
fitting tool.  Regardless of whether the fit is done interactively, the
overscan vector and the fit may be recorded for later review in a metacode
plot file named by the parameter \fIccdred.plotfile\fR.  The mean value of
the bias function is also recorded in the image header and log file.
.sh
3. Trim
When the parameter \fItrim\fR is set the input image will be trimmed to
the image section given by the parameter \fItrimsec\fR.  This trim
should, of course, be the same as that used for the calibration images.
.sh
4. Zerocor
After the readout bias is subtracted, as defined by the overscan or prescan
region, there may still be a zero level bias.  This level may be two
dimensional or one dimensional (the same for every readout line).  A
zero level calibration is obtained by taking zero length exposures;
generally many are taken and combined.  To apply this zero
level calibration the parameter \fIzerocor\fR is set.  In addition if
the zero level bias is only readout dependent then the parameter \fIreadcor\fR
is set to reduce two dimensional zero level images to one dimensional
images.  The zero level images may be specified by the parameter \fIzero\fR
or given in the input image list (provided the CCD image type is defined).

When the zero level image is needed to correct an input image it is checked
to see if it has been processed and, if not, it is processed automatically.
Processing of zero level images consists of bad pixel replacement,
overscan correction, trimming, and averaging to one dimension if the
readout correction is specified.
.sh
5. Darkcor
Dark counts are subtracted by scaling a dark count calibration image to
the same exposure time as the input image and subtracting.  The
exposure time used is the dark time which may be different than the
actual integration or exposure time.  A dark count calibration image is
obtained by taking a very long exposure with the shutter closed; i.e.
an exposure with no light reaching the detector.  The dark count
correction is selected with the parameter \fIdarkcor\fR and the dark
count calibration image is specified either with the parameter
\fIdark\fR or as one of the input images.  The dark count image is
automatically processed as needed.  Processing of dark count images
consists of bad pixel replacement, overscan and zero level correction,
and trimming.
.sh
6. Flatcor
The relative detector pixel response is calibrated by dividing by a
scaled flat field calibration image.  A flat field image is obtained by
exposure to a spatially uniform source of light such as an lamp or
twilight sky.  Flat field images may be corrected for the spectral
signature in spectroscopic images (see \fBresponse\fR and
\fBapnormalize\fR), or for iillumination effects (see \fBmkillumflat\fR
or \fBmkskyflat\fR).  For more on flat fields and iillumination corrections
see \fBflatfields\fR.  The flat field response is dependent on the
wavelength of light so if different filters or spectroscopic wavelength
coverage are used a flat field calibration for each one is required.
The different flat fields are  automatically selected by a subset
parameter (see \fBsubsets\fR).

Flat field calibration is selected with the parameter \fBflatcor\fR
and the flat field images are specified with the parameter \fBflat\fR
or as part of the input image list.  The appropriate subset is automatically
selected for each input image processed.  The flat field image is
automatically processed as needed.  Processing consists of bad pixel
replacement, overscan subtraction, zero level subtraction, dark count
subtraction, and trimming.  Also if a scan mode is used and the
parameter \fIscancor\fR is specified then a scan mode correction is
applied (see below).  The processing also computes the mean of the
flat field image which is used later to scale the flat field before
division into the input image.  For scan mode flat fields the ramp
part is included in computing the mean which will affect the level
of images processed with this flat field.  Note that there is no check for
division by zero in the interest of efficiency.  If division by zero
does occur a fatal error will occur.  The flat field can be fixed by
replacing small values using a task such as \fBimreplace\fR or
during processing using the \fIminreplace\fR parameter.  Note that the
\fIminreplace\fR parameter only applies to flat fields processed by
\fBccdproc\fR.
.sh
7. Illumcor
CCD images processed through the flat field calibration may not be
completely flat (in the absence of objects).  In particular, a blank
sky image may still show gradients.  This residual nonflatness is called
the iillumination pattern.  It may be introduced even if the detector is
uniformly illuminated by the sky because the flat field lamp
iillumination may be nonuniform.  The iillumination pattern is found from a
blank sky, or even object image, by heavily smoothing and rejecting
objects using sigma clipping.  The iillumination calibration image is
divided into the data being processed to remove the iillumination
pattern.  The iillumination pattern is a function of the subset so there
must be an iillumination correction image for each subset to be
processed.  The tasks \fBmkillumcor\fR and \fBmkskycor\fR are used to
create the iillumination correction images.  For more on iillumination
corrections see \fBflatfields\fR.

An alternative to treating the iillumination correction as a separate
operation is to combine the flat field and iillumination correction
into a corrected flat field image before processing the object
images.  This will save some processing time but does require creating
the flat field first rather than correcting the images at the same
time or later.  There are two methods, removing the large scale
shape of the flat field and combining a blank sky image iillumination
with the flat field.  These methods are discussed further in the
tasks which create them; \fBmkillumcor\fR and \fBmkskycor\fR.
.sh
8. Fringecor
There may be a fringe pattern in the images due to the night sky lines.
To remove this fringe pattern a blank sky image is heavily smoothed
to produce an iillumination image which is then subtracted from the
original sky image.  The residual fringe pattern is scaled to the
exposure time of the image to be fringe corrected and then subtracted.
Because the intensity of the night sky lines varies with time an
additional scaling factor may be given in the image header.
The fringe pattern is a function of the subset so there must be
a fringe correction image for each subset to be processed.
The task \fBmkfringecor\fR is used to create the fringe correction images.
.sh
9. Readcor
If a zero level correction is desired (\fIzerocor\fR parameter)
and the parameter \fIreadcor\fR is yes then a single zero level
correction vector is applied to each readout line or column.  Use of a
readout correction rather than a two dimensional zero level image
depends on the nature of the detector or if the CCD is operated in
longscan mode (see below).  The readout correction is specified by a
one dimensional image (\fIzero\fR parameter) and the readout axis
(\fIreadaxis\fR parameter).  If the zero level image is two dimensional
then it is automatically processed to a one dimensional image by
averaging across the readout axis.  Note that this modifies the zero
level calibration image.
.sh
10. Scancor
CCD detectors may be operated in several modes in astronomical
applications.  The most common is as a direct imager where each pixel
integrates one point in the sky or spectrum.  However, the design of most CCD's
allows the sky to be scanned across the CCD while shifting the
accumulating signal at the same rate.  \fBCcdproc\fR provides for two
scanning modes called "shortscan" and "longscan".  The type of scan
mode is set with the parameter \fIscanmode\fR.

In "shortscan" mode the detector is scanned over a specified number of
lines (not necessarily at sideral rates).  The lines that scroll off the
detector during the integration are thrown away.  At the end of the
integration the detector is read out in the same way as an unscanned
observation.  The advantage of this mode is that the small scale, zero
level, dark count and flat field responses are averaged in one dimension
over the number of lines scanned.  A zero level, dark count or flat field may be
observed in the same way in which case there is no difference in the
processing from unscanned imaging and the parameter \fIscancor\fR may be
no.  If it is yes, though, checking is done to insure that the calibration
image used has the same number of scan lines as the object being
processed.  However, one obtains an increase in the statistical accuracy of
if they are not scanned during the observation but
digitally scanned during the processing.  In shortscan mode with
\fIscancor\fR set to yes, zero level, dark count and flat field images are
digitally scanned, if needed, by the same number of scan lines as the
object.  The number of scan lines is determined from the object image
header using the keyword nscanrow (or it's translation).  If not found the
object is assumed to have been scanned with the value given by the
\fInscan\fR parameter.  Zero, dark and flat calibration images are assumed
to be unscanned if the header keyword is not found.

If a scanned zero level, dark count or flat field image is not found
matching the object then one may be created from the unscanned calibration
image.  The image will have the root name of the unscanned image with an
extension of the number of scan rows; i.e. Flat1.32 is created from Flat1
with a digital scanning of 32 lines.

In "longscan" mode the detector is continuously read out to produce an
arbitrarily long strip.  Provided data which has not passed over the entire
detector is thrown away, the zero level, dark count, and flat field
corrections will be one dimensional.  If \fIscancor\fR is specified and the
scan mode is "longscan" then a one dimensional zero level, dark count, and
flat field correction will be applied.
.sh
11. Processing Steps
The following describes the steps taken by the task.  This detailed
outline provides the most detailed specification of the task.

.ls 5 (1)
An image to be processed is first checked that it is of the specified
CCD image type.  If it is not the desired type then go on to the next image.
.le
.ls (2)
A temporary output image is created of the specified pixel data type
(\fBccdred.pixeltype\fR).  The header parameters are copied from the
input image.
.le
.ls (3)
If trimming is specified and the image has not been trimmed previously,
the trim section is determined.
.le
.ls (4)
If bad pixel replacement is specified and this has not been done
previously, the bad pixel file is determined either from the task
parameter or the instrument translation file.  The bad pixel regions
are read.  If the image has been trimmed previously and the bad pixel
file contains the word "untrimmed" then the bad pixel coordinates are
translated to those of the trimmed image.
.le
.ls (5)
If an overscan correction is specified and this correction has not been
applied, the overscan section is averaged along the readout axis.  If
trimming is to be done the overscan section is trimmed to the same
limits.  A function is fit either interactively or noninteractively to
the overscan vector.  The function is used to produce the overscan
vector to be subtracted from the image.  This is done in real
arithmetic.
.le
.ls (6)
If the image is a zero level image go to processing step 12.
If a zero level correction is desired and this correction has not been
performed, find the zero level calibration image.  If the zero level
calibration image has not been processed it is processed at this point.
This is done by going to processing step 1 for this image.  After the
calibration image has been processed, processing of the input image
continues from this point.
The processed calibration image may be
cached in memory if it has not been previously and if there is enough memory.
.le
.ls (7)
If the image is a dark count image go to processing step 12.
If a dark count correction is desired and this correction has not been
performed, find the dark count calibration image.  If the dark count
calibration image has not been processed it is processed at this point.
This is done by going to processing step 1 for this image.  After the
calibration image has been processed, processing of the input image
continues from this point.  The ratio of the input image dark time
to the dark count image dark time is determined to be multiplied with
each pixel of the dark count image before subtracting from the input
image.
The processed calibration image may be
cached in memory if it has not been previously and if there is enough memory.
.le
.ls (8)
If the image is a flat field image go to processing step 12.  If a flat
field correction is desired and this correction has not been performed,
find the flat field calibration image of the appropriate subset.  If
the flat field calibration image has not been processed it is processed
at this point.  This is done by going to processing step 1 for this
image.  After the calibration image has been processed, processing of
the input image continues from this point.  The mean of the image
is determined from the image header to be used for scaling.  If no
mean is found then a unit scaling is used.
The processed calibration image may be
cached in memory if it has not been previously and if there is enough memory.

If the image is an iillumination image go to processing step 12.  If an
iillumination correction is desired and this correction has not been performed,
find the iillumination calibration image of the appropriate subset.
The iillumination image must have the "mkillum" processing flag or the
\fBccdproc\fR will abort with an error.  The mean of the image
is determined from the image header to be used for scaling.  If no
mean is found then a unit scaling is used.  The processed calibration
image may be
cached in memory if it has not been previously and there is enough memory.

If the image is a fringe image go to processing step 12.  If a fringe
correction is desired and this correction has not been performed,
find the fringe calibration image of the appropriate subset.
The iillumination image must have the "mkfringe" processing flag or the
\fBccdproc\fR will abort with an error.  The ratio of the input
image exposure time to the fringe image exposure time is determined.
If there is a fringe scaling in the image header then this factor
is multiplied by the exposure time ratio.  This factor is used
for scaling.  The processed calibration image may be
cached in memory if it has not been previously and there is enough memory.

If there are no processing operations flagged, delete the temporary output

The input image is processed line by line with trimmed lines ignored.
A line of the input image is read.  Bad pixel replacement and trimming
is applied to the image.  Image lines from the calibration images
are read from disk or the image cache.  If the calibration is one
dimensional (such as a readout zero
level correction or a longscan flat field correction) then the image
vector is read only once.  Note that IRAF image I/O is buffered for
efficiency and accessing a line at a time does not mean that image
lines are read from disk a line at a time.  Given the input line, the
calibration images, the overscan vector, and the various scale factors
a special data path for each combination of corrections is used to
perform all the processing in the most efficient manner.  If the
image is a flat field any pixels less than the \fIminreplace\fR
parameter are replaced by that minimum value.  Also a mean is
computed for the flat field and stored as the CCDMEAN keyword and
the time, in a internal format, when this value was calculated is stored
in the CCDMEANT keyword.  The time is checked against the image modify
time to determine if the value is valid or needs to be recomputed.

The input image is deleted or renamed to a backup image.  The temporary
output image is renamed to the input image name.

If the image is a zero level image and the readout correction is specified
then it is averaged to a one dimensional readout correction.
.le
.ls (15)
If the image is a zero level, dark count, or flat field image and the scan
mode correction is specified then the correction is applied.  For shortscan
mode a modified two dimensional image is produced while for longscan mode a
one dimensional average image is produced.

The processing is completed and either the next input image is processed
beginning at step 1 or, if it is a calibration image which is being
processed for an input image, control returns to the step which initiated
the calibration image processing.

12. Processing Arithmetic
The \fBccdproc\fR task has two data paths, one for real image pixel datatypes
and one for short integer pixel datatype.  In addition internal arithmetic
is based on the rules of FORTRAN.  For efficiency there is
no checking for division by zero in the flat field calibration.
The following rules describe the processing arithmetic and data paths.

.ls (1)
If the input, output, or any calibration image is of type real the
real data path is used.  This means all image data is converted to
real on input.  If all the images are of type short all input data
is kept as short integers.  Thus, if all the images are of the same type
there is no datatype conversion on input resulting in greater
image I/O efficiency.
.le
.ls (2)
In the real data path the processing arithmetic is always real and,
if the output image is of short pixel datatype, the result
is truncated.
.le
.ls (3)
The overscan vector and the scale factors for dark count, flat field,
iillumination, and fringe calibrations are always of type real.  Therefore,
in the short data path any processing which includes these operations
will be coerced to real arithmetic and the result truncated at the end
of the computation.

13. In the Absence of Image Header Information
The tasks in the \fBccdred\fR package are most convenient to use when
the CCD image type, subset, and exposure time are contained in the
image header.  The ability to redefine which header parameters contain
this information makes it possible to use the package at many different
observatories (see \fBinstruments\fR).  However, in the absence of any
image header information the tasks may still be used effectively.
There are two ways to proceed.  One way is to use \fBccdhedit\fR
to place the information in the image header.

The second way is to specify the processing operations more explicitly
than is needed when the header information is present.  The parameter
\fIccdtype\fR is set to "" or to "none".  The calibration images are
specified explicitly by task parameter since they cannot be recognized
in the input list.  Only one subset at a time may be processed.

If dark count and fringe corrections are to be applied the exposure
times must be added to all the images.  Alternatively, the dark count
and fringe images may be scaled explicitly for each input image.  This
works because the exposure times default to 1 if they are not given in
the image header.

EXAMPLES
The user's \fBguide\fR presents a tutorial in the use of this task.

1. In general all that needs to be done is to set the task parameters
and enter

.nf
	cl> ccdproc *.imh &
.fi

This will run in the background and process all images which have not
been processed previously.
