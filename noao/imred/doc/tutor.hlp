DESCRIPTION
This task provides a tutorial facility for some of the IRAF packages.
The tutorial consists of a number of topics
which are obtained by typing "tutor topic" where topic is one of the
available topics.  If no topic is given then the available topics are
presented.  The topic "all" presents all the topics.

This task is implemented using the \fBhelp\fR task.  Therefore,
modifying the \fBhelp\fR parameters dealing with the device and print
format will also determine the output of \fBtutor\fR.  The tutorial
topic material is contained in the file Tutorial.hlp for each package.
The database containing the directory to the tutorial files may or may
not be the same as the standard help database.
