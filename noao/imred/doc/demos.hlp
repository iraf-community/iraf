DESCRIPTION
Many packages have demonstration and test procedures.  These are generally
based on artificial data and use the \fIstty playback\fR (see \fBstty\fR)
mechanism of the CL.  A playback replaces interactive terminal input 
with previously stored input but otherwise is an actual execution of
the entered commands.  This allows both demonstration of various types
and an actual test of the software on a particular IRAF system.

Generally the \fBdemos\fR procedures create their own data if not present
from a previous execution.  After the procedure is completed the data,
logfiles, etc. are left so that they may be examined further and
the user may try some experiments.  Thus, it might be useful to create
a new directory for the demo using \fBmkdir\fR and "cd" to it.

Currently, most of the demos are test procedures which do not contain
comments and suitable delays to act as a demonstration.  These will
be added in time.  Also some of the demos just create the demo/test
data if one just wants some relevant data for experimentation with
the package.

One should be aware that since the tasks are actually run parameters
are sometimes changed.

EXAMPLES
1.  From the \fBgoldcam\fR package list the menu and execute the
qtest demo.

.nf
	go> mkdir demo
	go> cd demo
	go> demos
		MENU of GOLDCAM Demonstrations

		qtest - Quick test of GOLDCAM (no comments, no delays)

	Demo name (qtest): 
	<Demo follows>
.fi

2.  From the \fBnessie\fR package create some simple test data.

.nf
	ne> demos mkqdata
	Creating image demoobj ...
	Creating image demoflat ...
	Creating image demoarc1 ...
	Creating image demoarc2 ...
	ne> demos mkqdata
	ne>
.fi

Note that the second execution does not create the data again.
