srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$listonly.cl
    For reasons that are now lost in the mists of time, the shortening of
    filenames can cause problems.  This has been removed.
    (2/11/11, Valdes) (See bug log 577)

=======
V2.12.3
=======

srcfibers$batch.cl
srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$fibresponse.cl
    Error messages now hint to check imtype setting.
    (4/15/05, Valdes)


=======
V2.12.2
=======

srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$batch.cl
    Because dispcor.samedisp=yes when doing the objects any dispersion change
    applied to the reference arc was not being applied to the objects.
    (5/21/03, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.1
=======

srcfibers$skysub.cl
    Added a flpr to workaround a FITS kernel caching problem.
    (6/21/02, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

srcfibers$proc.cl
    Modified code to eliminate goto.  This is for use with pyraf.
    (11/21/00, Valdes)

========
V2.11.3a
========

srcfibers$arcrefs.cl
    The test for crval/cdelt both INDEF was not working.  (9/24/99, Valdes)

srcfibers$mkfibers.cl
     Had to define a dummy variable 'ar' to get rid of ambiguous parameter
     error.  (9/14/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

doslit$arcrefs.cl
    The test on CRVAL and CDELT would not work with header keywords.
    (9/22/98, Valdes)

srcfibers$arcrefs.cl
srcfibers$batch.cl
srcfibers$doarcs.cl
srcfibers$fibresponse.cl
srcfibers$getspec.cl
srcfibers$listonly.cl

    Any additional qualifiers in the imtype string are stripped.
    (8/14/97, Valdes)

=========
V2.11BETA
=========

arcrefs.cl
    If both crval and cdelt are INDEF then the autoidentify option is
    not used.  (5/2/97, Valdes)

apsript.par
    Made changes for the new aperture selection option.  (9/5/96, Valdes)

skysub.cl
    Added package name to calls of "match", "sort", "uniq" to avoid
    possible conflicts.  (5/6/96, Valdes)

proc.cl
proc.par
arcrefs.cl
arcrefs.par
params.par
    Modified to use autoidentify.  (4/5/96, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$batch.cl
    When using subapertures the subapertures were not wavelength
    calibrated correctly because the reference arc spectrum which
    provides the wavelength scale does not contain the subapertures
    and DISPCOR does not use samedisp=yes.  Changed the value of
    samedisp to yes.  (10/27/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$mkfibers.cl
    The calls to mk1dspec did not specify the header file which would
    then default to the task parameter which might be invalid.
    (10/17/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
    Needed to initialize arcref2 in order work in batch when no dispersion
    correction is requested.  (10/16/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$mkfibers.cl
    The calls to MK1DSPEC were changed in accordance with parameter changes
    to that task.
    (7/28/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
    Any image extension is stripped from the apidtable parameter.
    (7/24/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$doalign.cl +
srcfibers$doalign.par +
srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$batch.cl
    Added the sky alignment option.  (7/19/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$batch.cl
srcfibers$arcrefs.cl
    The wrong range syntax is used with subapertures in SARITH/SCOPY.
    Changed all -999 to 1-999.  (6/14/95, Valdes)

=======
V2.10.4
=======

srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$fibresponse.cl
    1.  Need to add check for the throughput being a file rather than
	an image when checking whether to apply a scattered light
	correction.
    2.	Removed a warning message when using a throughput file containing
    	fiber values which are not in the flat field (for example, if a fiber
    	is broken).
    (1/25/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$params.par
srcfibers$doarcs.cl
srcfibers$arcrefs.cl
    Added "threshold" as a user parameter.  (1/16/95, Valdes)

srcfibers$response.cl -> imred$src/fibers/fibresponse.cl
srcfibers$response.par -> imred$src/fibers/fibresponse.par
srcfibers$proc.par
    Changed the fiber response task name from "response" to "fibresponse"
    to avoid conflict with longslit.response.  (12/31/94, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
    The check for arcs2 = " " was done incorrectly.  (9/12/94, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
srcfibers$batch.cl
srcfibers$doarcs.cl
    A check was needed on whether the arc spectra were extracted during
    the current execution to avoid reextracting the same arc multiple
    times during a "redo" or the initial time.  In both those cases
    the rextract flag is set causing spectra to be reextracted if they
    exist.  Previously doarcs could not tell if the arc exists because
    of a previous run or during the current run with the same arc
    used multiple times.  (5/18/94, Valdes)

===========
V2.10.3beta
===========

srcfibers$skysub.cl
imred$specred/doc/skysub.hlp
    1.  The combine option was being ignored.
    2.  The help did not mention the reject option and was otherwised
	out of date.
    (3/31/94, Valdes)

srcfibers$proc.cl
    The scattered light correction is now queried for all images and may
    be turned off with NO.  (9/1/93, Valdes)

===========
V2.10.3beta
===========

srcfibers$arcrefs.cl
     MOdified to use shift=INDEF in REIDENTIFY.
     (2/18/93, Valdes)

srcfibers$*.cl
     Modified to use the "imtype" environment variable to define the
     extension type.
     (2/18/93, Valdes)

=======
V2.10.2
=======

srcfibers$proc.cl
     The aperture reference is redone when a new aperture ID file is seen.
     (1/11/93, Valdes)

srcfibers$*
     Updated for new ONEDSPEC.  (7/24/91, Valdes)

srcfibers$*
     All occurrences of latitude replaced by observatory as required by
     recent changes to setairmass, etc.  (11/20/90, Valdes)
