crexamine.x
    The CR_WT struct element was allocated as TY_REAL but was being used as
    a Memi array, leading to a segfault on 64-bit systems (4/7/14, MJF)

t_cosmicrays.x
    A pointer to a an array of pointers was used in one place as a real.  This
    is an error when integer and real arrays are not of the same size; i.e.
    on 64-bit architectures.  (8/2/12, Valdes)

V2.16.1
=======

t_craverage.x
    The pointer for the input mask buffer when using the same mask for both
    input and output was not being read to include the edge lines which are
    used during the computation resulting in a segmentation violation.
    (11/24/04, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.2
=======

t_craverage.x
    To grow an output mask create by the task requires closing the new mask
    and reopening it READ_WRITE.  (10/23/02, Valdes)

t_craverage.x
t_crmedian.x
    The mask name may be !<keyword>.  (3/22/02, Valdes)

xtmaskname.x	+
t_craverage.x
t_crmedian.x
t_crgrow.x
mkpkg
    Modified to allow FITS mask extensions.  (3/22/02, Valdes)
    
mkpkg
    Added missing mkpkg depencies for several source files. (12/13/01, MJF)

============================
CRUTIL V1.5: August 22, 2001
============================

crcombine.cl
crcombine.par
../doc/crcombine.hlp
    Modified to use new version of IMCOMBINE.  (8/22/01, Valdes)

noao$imred/crutil/	+
    Installed package into the NOAO.IMRED package.  (8/22/01, Valdes)

t_craverage.x
    The nrej features was done wrong for nrej of 1 or 2. (5/3/01, Valdes)

t_craverage.x
    1.  The amov and aclr calls were using the wrong buffer start.
    2.  Added missing imtclose calls.
    3.  The growing needed to be moved outside the block buffering.
    (10/4/00, Valdes as diagnosed by Davis)

t_craverage.x
craverage.par
../doc/craverage.hlp
    Added an nrej parameter to excluded additional pixels from the average.
    This is needed to deal with cosmic rays which are bigger than one
    pixel or very nearby additional cosmic rays.  (9/13/00, Valdes)

========================
CRUTIL V1.4: Jan 6, 2000
========================

t_crmedian.x
    The calculation of the sigma would reference uninitialized data if
    the image size was not a multiple of the sigma block size.
    (1/6/00, Valdes)

t_craverage.x
    The indexing of the pixels to use for the sigma calculation was wrong.
    (1/6/00, Valdes)

t_craverage.x	+
craverage.par	+
x_crutil.e
mkpkg
../crutil.cl
../crutil.men
../crutil.hd
    New task that finds cosmic rays against an average excluding the candidate
    pixel.  It also detects objects and prevents cosmic rays being detected
    in them (i.e. the cores of stars).  (11/30/99, Valdes)

t_crgrow.x
crgrow.par
    1.	Broke main grow loop into a subroutine that can be called by other
	tasks.
    2.  Added inval and outval parameters to allow selecting mask values.
    (11/30/99, Valdes)

========================
CRUTIL V1.3: Oct 19, 1999
========================

crnebula.cl
    The rin and rout parameters were not being used and instead
    the default values were hardwired.  (10/19/99, Valdes)

========================
CRUTIL V1.2: Sep 4, 1998
========================

t_crmedian.x
    On images with more than about 500K pixels the median operation is
    done in overlapping blocks of lines.  The amount of overlap is
    half of the line median size "lmed".  The bug is that on output
    the overlap regions end up being zero.  The output i/o is now done
    in non-overlapping blocks.  (9/4/98, Valdes)

=====================
CRUTIL V1.1: May 1998
=====================

crexamine.x
cosmicrays.key	+
cosmicrays.hlp
    The graphical deletion and undeletion of candidates now includes the
    keys 'e' and 'v' to delete and undelete from a marked rectangular
    region.  Also the key file was moved to the source directory.
    (Valdes/Shopbell 5/15/98)

cosmicrays.par
    Fixed type in "crmasks" parameter name.
    (Valdes/Shopbell 5/15/98)
