NAME
crfix -- fix cosmic rays in images using cosmic ray masks
.ih
USAGE	
.nf
crfix input output masks
.fi
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Input two dimensional image to be "fixed" (modified) by linear interpolation.
.le
.ls output
Output image.  If the output image name exactly matches the input
image name (including extensions) then the image will be modified in place.
.le
.ls crmask
Cosmic ray mask identifying the cosmic rays to be fixed.  The mask
values are zero for good data and non-zero for cosmic rays.

DESCRIPTION
The input and output images are specified by the \fIinput\fR and
\fIoutput\fR parameters.  If the input and output image names are
identifical (including extensions) then image is modified in place.  Cosmic
rays, identified in a cosmic ray mask specified by the \fIcrmask\fR
parameter, are replaced in the output image by linear interpolation along
lines or columns using the nearest good pixels.  The special mask name
"BPM" may be used to select a mask name given in the input image header
under the keyword "BPM".

Cosmic ray pixels are "fixed" by replacing them with values
by linear interpolation to the nearest pixels not identified as bad.
The interpolation direction is the shortest length between good pixels
along columns or lines.
