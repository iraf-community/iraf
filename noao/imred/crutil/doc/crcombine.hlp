DESCRIPTION
This task is a version of \fBimcombine\fR.  See the help for that task
for a description of the parameters and algorithms.

For the purpose of removing cosmic rays the most useful options
are the "crreject" algorithm and/or combining with a median.  Many other
options may work as well.  The best use of this task depends on the
number of images available.  If there are more than a few images the
images should be combined with an "average" and using a rejection
algorithm.

EXAMPLES
1.  To combine two images using the gain and read noise parameters in
the image header:

.nf
    cl> crcombine obj012,obj013 abc gain=gain rdnoise=rdnoise
