    The output pixel type is now changed to real rather than preserving
    the input pixel type.  (3/2/93, Valdes)

    The graphics device parameter was being ignored and "stdgraph" always
    opened.

    1. The parameters low_reject, high_reject and niterate have been added
    to the linebias and colbias tasks which then pass them to the icfit
    package.

    1.  The fix of December 3 was slightly wrong.
	296: ...Memr[buf2+(k-1)*n+i-1] ==> ...Memr[buf2+k*n+i-j]
    2.  Increased the maximum buffer MAXPIX from 10000 to 100000.

    1.  When the bias section consists of just one column or line the
	dimensionality of the mapped bias decreases.  The code had to be
	modified to recognize and work properly in this case.

    1.  There was a bug in using the median option which gave incorrect
	results for the bias vector.
	291: n = min (nx - j - 1, maxn)	==> n = min (nx - j + 1, maxn)
	296: ...Memr[buf2+(k-1)*n+i-1]	==> ...Memr[buf2+(k-1)*n+i-j]

    1.  The log information for LINEBIAS identified itself as COLBIAS.

    1.  COLBIAS and LINEBIAS modified to use new ICFIT package.

=========================================
STScI Pre-release and 1st SUN 2.3 Release
=========================================

===========
Release 2.2
===========

From Valdes Dec 12, 1985:

1.  COLBIAS and LINEBIAS changes to allow taking a median instead of an
average when generating the 1D bias data.
------
From Valdes Dec 11, 1985:

1.  COLBIAS and LINEBIAS changed to use image templates instead of filename
templates.  This allows use of the concatenation function even though the
images should not have images sections.

2.  REVS task removed.
------
From Valdes Oct 4, 1985:

1.  Colbais and linebias recompiled because of the change in the icfit package
for low and high rejection and rejection iteration.
------
From Valdes Aug 7, 1985:

1.  The task revisions has been added to page package revisions.
To get the system revisions type system.revisions.

2.  The parameters to linebias and colbias now include control over
the graphics output device, the graphics input cursor, and multiple logfiles.

3.  Changes have been made to use the "improved" icfit and gtools packages.
