.ls output_root
Root name of output files.

DESCRIPTION
Destreak5 takes as input the 5 files from a vacuum telescope 10830
tape and produces 5 nearly identical files but with the streaks
removed from the solar images and with the best fit ellipse parameters
added to the image header.  The input files are expected to be in the
directory 'imdir' and to have the extensions '001' thru '005'.  These
input files are expected to be mag tape images produced by T2D.  The output
files are stored in the current directory with the same extensions.
Destreak5 calls 'readvt','quickfit', 'destreak', and various other utilities
and is a cl script file.
If an input image is not found, the processing for that image is skipped and
a message is printed telling about the missing image.
The next step in the 10830 reduction process is 'makehelium' which produces
the projected daily grams.
