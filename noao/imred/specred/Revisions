V2.12.3
=======

specred.cl
specred.men
    1.  Added ODCOMBINE and LSCOMBINE to the package.
    2.  Modified SCOMBINE to point to new executable.
    (6/21/04, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

imred$specred/msresp1d.cl
    Modified to use "imtype" rather than hardwired to "imh".  This uses
    the same code as srcfibers$fibresponse.cl.
    (2/29/00, Valdes)

=========
V2.11.3p1
=========
=======
V2.11.3
=======

imred$specred/doc/msresp1d.hlp
    The package was incorrect and the requirement that the unextracted
    spectrum must be present even if the extracted spectrum is present
    was made clearer.  (9/20/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

imred$specred/doc/dofibers.hlp
imred$specred/doc/doslit.hlp
imred$specred/doc/dofibers.ms
imred$specred/doc/doslit.ms
    Updated for change where if both crval and cdelt are INDEF then the
    automatic identification is not done.  (5/2/96, Valdes)

imred$specred/specred.cl
    Increased the minimum min_lenuserarea from 40000 to 100000.
    (7/31/96, Valdes)

imred$specred/doc/doslit.hlp
imred$specred/doc/doslit.ms
    Updated for the addition of automatic arc line identification.  (4/9/96)

imred$specred/sparams.par
    Changed match from 10 to -3.  (4/5/96, Valdes)

imred$specred/doc/dofibers.hlp
imred$specred/doc/dofibers.ms
imred$specred/doc/doslit.hlp
imred$specred/doc/doslit.ms
    Added crval/cdelt parameters used in new version with automatic arc
    line identification.  (4/5/96, Valdes)

imred$specred/doc/msresp1d.hlp
    Added a sentence to say that extracted throughput (sky) spectra are
    flat fielded before computing the throughput values.  (1/9/96, Valdes)

imred$specred/doc/dofibers.hlp
imred$specred/doc/dofibers.ms
    Describes the new header option for the aperture identification table.
    (7/25/95, Valdes)

    Added sky alignment option.  (7/19/95, Valdes)

=======
V2.10.4
=======

specred/specred.cl
specred/specred.men
    1.  Added background, illumination, and response.
    2.  Renamed the fiber response task to "fibresponse".
    (12/29/94, Valdes)

imred$specred/dofibers.cl
    There was an incorrect default value for the dispaxis parameter:
	)_dispaxis --> )_.dispaxis.  (8/24/92, Valdes)

=============
V2.10-V2.10.1
=============

imred$msred --> imred$specred
    Renamed the package to a more generic name since it is for both
    multiple aperture/fiber data as well as generic slit data.
    (2/20/92, Valdes)

imred$msred/msred.cl
imred$msred/msred.hd
    Added generic slit and fiber reduction tasks to make this a complete
    generic package.  (2/19/92, Valdes)

imred$msred/msresp1d.cl
    Improved task to include throughput file (2/18/92, Valdes)

imred$msred/msresp1d.cl +
imred$msred/doc/msresp1d.hlp +
imred$msred/msred.cl
imred$msred/msred.hd
    1.  Added new task MSRESP1D modeled after imred$src/fibers/response but
	using APALL instead of APSCRIPT and all the connections to PARAMS.
    2.  Added new task SKYSUB from imred$src/fibers.

imred$msred/msbplot.cl -
imred$msred/doc/msdispcor.hlp -
imred$msred/doc/msbplot.hlp -

    Added a version of ECBPLOT (written by Rob Seaman) to the package with
    appropriate changes to refer to lines and apertures instead of
    orders.  (10/27/89, Valdes)

imred$msred/doc/msdispcor.hlp
    Tried to make the description of the global parameter clearer.  Also
    fixed an incorrect example.  (8/29/89, Valdes)
