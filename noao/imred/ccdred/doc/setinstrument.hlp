NAME
setinstrument -- Set instrument parameters
.ih
USAGE	
setinstrument instrument
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls instrument
Instrument identification for instrument parameters to be set.  If '?'
then a list of the instrument identifiers is printed.
.le
.ls site = "kpno"
Site ID.
.le
.ls directory = "ccddb$"
Instrument directory containing instrument files.  The instrument files
are found in the subdirectory given by the site ID. 
.le
.ls review = yes
Review the instrument parameters?  If yes then \fBeparam\fR is run for
the parameters of \fBccdred\fR and \fBccdproc\fR.
.le
.ls query
Parameter query if initial instrument is not found.

DESCRIPTION
The purpose of the task is to allow the user to easily set default
parameters for a new instrument.  The default parameters are generally
defined by support personal in an instrument directory for a particular
site.  The instrument directory is the concatenation of the specified
directory and the site.  For example if the directory is "ccddb$" and
the site is "kpno" then the instrument directory is "ccddb$kpno/".
The user may have his own set of instrument files in a local directory.
The current directory is used by setting the directory and site to the
null string ("").

The user specifies an instrument identifier.  This instrument may
be specific to a particular observatory, telescope, instrument, and
detector.  If the character '?' is specified or the instrument file is
not found then a list of instruments
in the instrument directory is produced by paging the file "instruments.men".
The task then performs the following operations:
.ls (1)
If an instrument translation file with the name given by the instrument
ID and the extension ".dat" is found then the instrument translation
file parameter, \fIccdred.instrument\fR, is set to this file.
If it does not exist then the user is queried again.  Note that a
null instrument, "", is allowed to set no translation file.
.le
.ls (2)
If an instrument setup script with the name given by the instrument ID
and the extension ".cl" is found then the commands in the file are
executed (using the command \fIcl < script\fR.  This script generally
sets default parameters.
.le
.ls (3)
If the review flag is set the task \fBeparam\fR is run to allow the user
to examine and modify the parameters for the package \fBccdred\fR and task
\fBccdproc\fR.
.le

EXAMPLES
1. To get a list of the instruments;

.nf
	cl> setinstrument ?
	[List of instruments]

2. To set the instrument and edit the processing parameters:

	cl> setinstrument ccdlink
	[Edit CCDRED parameters]
	[Edit CCDPROC parameters]

3. To use your own instrument translation file and/or setup script in
your working directory.

	cl> setinst.site=""
	cl> setinst.dir=""
	cl> setinst myinstrument

To make these files see help under \fBinstruments\fR.  Copying and modifying
system files is also straightforward.

	cl> copy ccddb$kpno/fits.dat .
	cl> edit fits.dat
	cl> setinst.site=""
	cl> setinst.dir=""
	cl> setinst fits
.fi
