NAME
mkillumflat -- Make illumination corrected flat fields
.ih
USAGE
mkillumflat input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input flat field images to be illumination corrected.
.le
.ls output
List of output illumination corrected flat field images.
If none is specified or if the name is the same as the
input image then the output image replaces the input image.
.le
.ls ccdtype = "flat"
CCD image type to select from the input images.
.le
.ls xboxmin = 5, xboxmax = 0.25, yboxmin = 5, yboxmax = 0.25
Minimum and maximum smoothing box size along the x and y axes.  The
minimum box size is used at the edges and grows to the maximum size in
the middle of the image.  This allows the smoothed image to better
represent gradients at the edge of the image.  If a size is less then 1
then it is interpreted as a fraction of the image size.  If a size is
greater than or equal to 1 then it is the box size in pixels.  A size
greater than the size of image selects a box equal to the size of the
image.
.le
.ls clip = yes
Clean the input images of objects?  If yes then a clipping algorithm is
used to detect and exclude objects from the smoothing.
.le
.ls lowsigma = 2.5, highsigma = 2.5
Sigma clipping thresholds above and below the smoothed illumination.
.le
.ls divbyzero = 1.
The illumination flat field is the ratio of the flat field to a
smoothed flat field.  This may produce division by zero.  A warning is
given if division by zero takes place and the result (the illumination
corrected flat field value) is replaced by the value of this
parameter.
.le
.ls ccdproc (parameter set)
CCD processing parameters.
.le

DESCRIPTION
First, the input flat field images are processed as needed.  Then the
large scale illumination pattern of the images is removed.  The
illumination pattern is determined by heavily smoothing the image using
a moving "boxcar" average.  The output image is the ratio of the input
image to the illumination pattern.  The illumination pattern is
normalized by its mean to preserve the mean level of the input image.

When this task is applied to flat field images only the small scale
response effects are retained.  This is appropriate if the flat field
images have illumination effects which differ from the astronomical
images and blank sky images are not available for creating sky
corrected flat fields.  When a high quality blank sky image is
available the related task \fBmkskyflat\fR should be used.  Note that
the illumination correction, whether from the flat field or a sky
image, may be applied as a separate step by using the task
\fBmkillumcor\fR or \fBmkskycor\fR and applying the illumination
correction as a separate operation in \fBccdproc\fR.  However, creating
an illumination corrected flat field image before processing is more
efficient since one less operation per image processed is needed.  For
more discussion about flat fields and illumination corrections see
\fBflatfields\fR.

The smoothing algorithm is a moving average over a two dimensional
box.  The algorithm is unconvential in that the box size is not fixed.
The box size is increased from the specified minimum at the edges to
the maximum in the middle of the image.  This permits a better estimate
of the background at the edges, while retaining the very large scale
smoothing in the center of the image.  Note that the sophisticated
tools of the \fBimages\fR package may be used for smoothing but this
requires more of the user and, for the more sophisticated smoothing
algorithms such as surface fitting, more processing time.

To minimize the effects of bad pixels a sigma clipping algorithm is
used to detect and reject these pixels from the illumination.  This is
done by computing the rms of the image lines relative to the smoothed
illumination and excluding points exceeding the specified threshold
factors times the rms.  This is done before each image line is added to
the moving average, except for the first few lines where an iterative
process is used.
