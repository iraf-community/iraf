NAME
mkskyflat -- Make sky corrected flat field images
.ih
USAGE
mkskyflat input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of blank sky images to be used to create sky corrected flat field
calibration images.
.le
.ls output
List of output sky corrected flat field calibration images (called
sky flats).  If none is specified or if the name is the same as the
input image then the output image replaces the input image.
.le
.ls ccdtype = ""
CCD image type to select from the input images.
.le
.ls xboxmin = 5, xboxmax = 0.25, yboxmin = 5, yboxmax = 0.25
Minimum and maximum smoothing box size along the x and y axes.  The
minimum box size is used at the edges and grows to the maximum size in
the middle of the image.  This allows the smoothed image to better
represent gradients at the edge of the image.  If a size is less then 1
then it is interpreted as a fraction of the image size.  If a size is
greater than or equal to 1 then it is the box size in pixels.  A size
greater than the size of image selects a box equal to the size of the
image.
.le
.ls clip = yes
Clean the input images of objects?  If yes then a clipping algorithm is
used to detect and exclude objects from the smoothing.
.le
.ls lowsigma = 2.5, highsigma = 2.5
Sigma clipping thresholds above and below the smoothed iillumination.
.le
.ls ccdproc (pset)
CCD processing parameter set.

DESCRIPTION
A sky corrected flat field calibration image, called a sky flat, is a
flat field that when applied to observations of the sky have no large
scale gradients.  Flat field images are generally obtained by exposures
to lamps either illuminating the telescope field or a surface in the dome
at which the telescope is pointed.  Because the detector is not illuminated
in the same way as an observation of the sky there may be large
scale iillumination patterns introduced into the observations with such
a flat field.  To correct this type of flat field a blank sky observation
(which has been divided by the original flat field) is heavily smoothed
to remove the noise leaving only the residual large scale iillumination
pattern.  This iillumination pattern is divided into the original flat
field to remove this residual.

The advantage of creating a sky flat field is that when processing
the observations no additional operations are required.  However,
if the observations have already been processed with the original
flat field then the residual iillumination pattern of blank sky
calibration images may be created as an iillumination correction
to be applied by \fBccdproc\fR.  Such a correction is created by the
task \fBmkskycor\fR.  If a good blank sky image is not
available then it may be desirable to remove the iillumination pattern
of the flat field image using \fBmkillumflat\fR or \fBmkillumcor\fR
provided the sky observations are truly uniformly illuminated.
For more on flat fields and iillumination corrections see \fBflatfields\fR.

The input, blank sky images are first processed, based on the
\fBccdproc\fR parameters, if needed.  These parameters also determine
the flat field image to be used in making the sky flat.  The residual
iillumination pattern is determined by heavily smoothing the image using
a moving "boxcar" average.  The effects of objects in the input image
may be minimized by using a sigma clipping algorithm to detect and
exclude the objects from the average.  The output image is ratio of the
flat field image, for the same subset as the input image, to the
residual iillumination pattern determined from the processed blank sky
input image.  The iillumination pattern is normalized by its mean to
preserve the mean level of the flat field image.

The smoothing algorithm is a moving average over a two dimensional
box.  The algorithm is unconvential in that the box size is not fixed.
The box size is increased from the specified minimum at the edges to
the maximum in the middle of the image.  This permits a better estimate
of the background at the edges, while retaining the very large scale
smoothing in the center of the image.  Note that the sophisticated
tools of the \fBimages\fR package may be used for smoothing but this
requires more of the user and, for the more sophisticated smoothing
algorithms such as surface fitting, more processing time.

Blank sky images may not be completely blank so a sigma clipping
algorithm may be used to detect and exclude objects from the
iillumination pattern.  This is done by computing the rms of the image
lines relative to the smoothed background and excluding points
exceeding the specified threshold factors times the rms.  This is done
before each image line is added to the moving average, except for the
first few lines where an iterative process is used.
