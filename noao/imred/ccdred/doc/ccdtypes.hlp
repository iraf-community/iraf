CCDTYPES
The following CCD image types may be specified as the value of the parameter
\fIccdtype\fR:

.nf
	""	- (the null string) all image types
	object	- object images
	zero	- zero level images such as a bias or preflash
	dark	- dark count images
	flat	- flat field images
	illum	- iillumination images
	fringe	- fringe correction images
	other   - other image types defined in the translation file
	none	- images without an image type parameter
	unknown - image types not defined in the translation file
.fi

DESCRIPTION
The \fBccdred\fR package recognizes certain standard CCD image types
identified in the image header.  The tasks may select images of a
particular CCD image type from image lists with the parameter
\fIccdtype\fR and also recognize and take special actions for
calibration images.

In order to make use of CCD image type information the header keyword
identifying the image type must be specified in the instrument
translation file.  This entry has the form

	imagetyp keyword

where keyword is the image header keyword.  This allows the package to
access the image type string.  There must also be a translation between
the image type strings and the CCD types as recognized by the package.
This information consists of lines in the instrument translation file
of the form

	header	package

where header is the exact string given in the image header and package
is one of the types recognized by the package.  The image header string
can be virtually anything and if it contains blanks it must be
quoted.  The package image types are those given above except for
the null string, "none", and "unknown".  That is, these types may
be specified as a CCD image type in selecting images but not as a translations
of image type strings.

There may be more than one image type that maps to the same package
type.  In particular other standard CCD image types, such as comparison
spectra, multiple exposure, standard star, etc., should be mapped to
object or other.  There may also be more than one type of flat field, i.e. dome
flat, sky flat, and lamp flat.  For more on the instrument translation
file see the help for \fBinstruments\fR.

EXAMPLES
1. The example entries in the instrument translation file are from the 1986
NOAO CCD image header format produced by the CAMERA format tape writer.

.nf
    imagetyp			data-typ

    'OBJECT (0)'		object
    'DARK (1)'			dark
    'PROJECTOR FLAT (2)'	flat
    'SKY FLAT (3)'		other
    'COMPARISON LAMP (4)'	other
    'BIAS (5)'			zero
    'DOME FLAT (6)'		flat
.fi

The image header keyword describing the image type is "data-typ".
The values of the image type strings in the header contain blanks so they
are quoted.  Also the case of the strings is important.  Note that there
are two types of flat field images and two types of other images.

2. One way to check the image types is with the task \fBccdlist\fR.

.nf
    cl> ccdlist *.imh
    Zero.imh[504,1][real][zero][1][OT]:FOCUS L98-193
    Flat1.imh[504,1][real][flat][1][OTZ]:dflat 6v+blue 5s
    ccd002.imh[504,504][real][unknown][1][OTZF]:FOCUS L98-193
    ccd003.imh[544,512][short][object][1]:L98-193
    ccd004.imh[544,512][short][object][1]:L98-193
    ccd005.imh[544,512][short][object][1]:L98-193
    oldformat.imh[544,512][short][none][1]:M31 V
.fi

The unknown type has a header image type of "MUL (8)".  The old format
image does not have any header type.

3. To select only images of a particular type:

.nf
    cl> ccdlist *.imh ccdtype=object
    ccd003.imh[544,512][short][object][1]:L98-193
    ccd004.imh[544,512][short][object][1]:L98-193
    ccd005.imh[544,512][short][object][1]:L98-193
    cl> ccdlist *.imh ccdtype=unknown
    ccd002.imh[504,504][real][unknown][1][OTZF]:FOCUS L98-193
    cl> ccdlist *.imh ccdtype=none
    oldformat.imh[544,512][short][none][1]:M31 V
.fi

4. To process images with \fBccdproc\fR:

.nf
    cl> ccdproc *.imh
    cl> ccdproc *.imh ccdtype=object
.fi

In the first case all the images will be processed (the default value of
\fIccdtype\fR is "").  However, the task recognizes the calibration
images, such as zero level and flat fields, and processes them appropriately.
In the second case only object images are processed and all other images
are ignored (except if needed as a calibration image).
