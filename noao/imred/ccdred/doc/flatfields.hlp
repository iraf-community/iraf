NAME
flatfields -- Discussion of CCD flat field calibrations
.ih
DESCRIPTION
This topic describes the different types of CCD flat fields and
the tasks available in the \fBccdred\fR and spectroscopy packages for
creating them.  Flat field calibration is the most important operation
performed on CCD data.  This operation calibrates the relative response
of the detector at each pixel.  In some cases this is as simple as
taking a special type of observation called a flat field.  However, in
many cases this calibration observation must be corrected for
iillumination, scanning, wavelength, and aperture effects.

The discussion is in three sections; direct imaging, scan mode,
and spectroscopy.  Though there are many similarities between these
modes of operation there are important differences in how corrections
are applied to the basic flat field observations.  The application of
the flat field calibrations to the observations using \fBccdproc\fR is
the same in all cases, however.

1. Direct Imaging
The starting point for determining the flat field calibration is an
observation of something which should have uniform response at all
points on the detector.  In addition the color of the light falling at
each pixel should be the same as that in an observation so the same
filter must be used when determining the flat field (the issue of the
matching the color of the objects observed at the appropriate pixels is
ignored here).  The best calibration observation is of a blank sky.  If
an accurate blank sky observation can be obtained then this is all that
is needed for a flat field calibration.  This type of flat field might
be called a \fIsky flat\fR, though this term is more often used for a
type of flat field described below.  There are two difficulties with
this type of calibration; finding a really blank sky and getting a
sufficiently accurate measurement without using all the observing
time.

It is usually not possible to get a blank sky observation accurate
enough to calibrate the individual pixels without introducing
undesirable noise.  What is generally done is to use a lamp to either
uniformly illuminate a part of the dome or directly illuminate the
field of view.  The first type of observation is called a \fIdome
flat\fR and the second is called a \fIprojection flat\fR.  We shall call
both of these types of observations \fBlamp flat fields\fR.  If the
iillumination is truely uniform then these types of observations are
sufficient for flat field calibration.  To get a very accurate flat
field many observations are made and then combined (see
\fBflatcombine\fR).

Unfortunately, it is sometimes the case that the lamp flat fields
do not illuminate the telescope/detector in the same way as the actual
observations.  Calibrating with these flat fields will introduce a
residual large scale iillumination pattern, though it will correctly
calibrate the relative pixel responses locally.  There are two ways to
correct for this effect.  The first is to correct the flat field
observation.  The second is to apply the uncorrected flat field to the
observations and then apply an \fIiillumination\fR correction as a
separate operation.  The first is more efficient since it consists of a
single correction applied to each observation but in some cases the
approximate correction is desired immediately, the observation needed
to make the correction has not been taken yet, or the residual
iillumination error is not discovered until later.

For the two methods there are two types of correction.  One is to
use a blank sky observation to correct for the residual iillumination
pattern.  This is different than using the sky observation directly as
a flat field calibration in that only the large scale pattern is
needed.  Determining the large scale iillumination does not require high
signal-to-noise at each pixel and faint objects in the image can be
either eliminated or ignored.  The second method is to remove the large
scale shape from the lamp flat field.  This is not as good as using a
blank sky observation but, if there is no such observation and the
iillumination pattern is essentially only in the lamp flat field, this
may be sufficient.

From the above two paragraphs one sees there are four options.
There is a task in the \fBccdred\fR package for each of these options.
To correct a lamp flat field observation by a blank sky observation,
called a \fIsky flat\fR, the task is \fBmkskyflat\fR.  To correct the
flat field for its own large scale gradients, called an \fIiillumination
flat\fR, the task is \fBmkillumflat\fR.  To create a secondary
correction to be applied to data processed with the lamp flat field
image the tasks are \fBmkskycor\fR and \fBmkillumcor\fR which are,
respectively, based on a blank sky observation and the lamp flat field
iillumination pattern.

With this introduction turn to the individual documentation for these
four tasks for further details.

2. Scan Mode
There are two types of scan modes supported by the \fBccdred\fR
package; \fIshortscan\fR and \fIlongscan\fR (see \fBccdproc\fR for
further details).  They both affect the manner in which flat field
calibrations are handled.  The shortscan mode produces images which are
the same as direct images except that the light recorded at each pixel
was collected by a number of different pixels.  This improves the flat
field calibration.  If the flat field images, of the same types
described in the direct imaging section, are observed in the same way
as all other observations, i.e. in scan mode, then there is no
difference from direct imaging (except in the quality of the flat
fields).  There is a statistical advantage to observing the lamp or sky
flat field without scanning and then numerically averaging to simulate
the result of the scanning.  This improves the accuracy of
the flat fields and might possibly allow direct blank sky observations
to be used for flat fields.  The numerical scanning is done in
\fBccdproc\fR by setting the appropriate scanning parameters.

In longscan mode the CCD detector is read out in such a way that
each output image pixel is the sum of the light falling on all pixels
along the direction of the scan.  This reduces the flat field calibration
to one dimension, one response value for each point across the scan.
The one dimensional calibration is obtained from a longscan observation
by averaging all the readout lines.
This is done automatically in \fBccdproc\fR by setting the appropriate
parameters.  In this case very good flat fields can be obtained from
one or more blank sky observations or an unscanned lamp observation.  Other
corrections are not generally used.

3. Spectroscopy
Spectroscopic flat fields differ from direct imaging in that the
spectrum of the sky or lamp and transmission variations with wavelength
are part of the observation.  Application of such images will introduce
the inverse of the spectrum and transmission into the observation.  It
also distorts the observed counts making signal-to-noise estimates
invalid.  This, and the low signal in the dispersed light, makes it
difficult to use blank sky observations directly as flat fields.  As
with direct imaging, sky observation may be used to correct for
iillumination errors if necessary.  At sufficiently high dispersion the
continuous lamp spectrum may be flat enough that the spectral signature
of the lamp is not a problem.  Alternatively, flux calibrating the
spectra will also remove the flat field spectral signature.  The
spectroscopic flat fields also have to be corrected for regions outside
of the slit or apertures to avoid bad response effects when applying
the flat field calibration to the observations.

The basic scheme for removing the spectral signature is to average
all the lines or columns across the dispersion and within the aperture
to form an estimate of the spectrum.  In addition to the averaging, a
smooth curve is fit to the lamp spectrum to remove noise.  This smooth
shape is then divided back into each line or column to eliminate the
shape of the spectrum without changing the shape of the spectrum
in the spatial direction or the small scale response variations.
Regions outside of the apertures are replaced by unity.
This method requires that the dispersion be aligned fairly close to
either the CCD lines or columns.

This scheme is used in both longslit and multiaperture spectra.
The latter includes echelle, slitlets, aperture masks, and fiber feeds.
For narrow apertures which do not have wider slits for the lamp
exposures there may be problems with flexure and defining a good
composite spectrum.  The algorithm for longslit spectra is simpler and
is available in the task \fBresponse\fR in the \fBlongslit\fR package.
For multiaperture data there are problems of defining where the spectra
lie and avoiding regions off of the aperture where there is no signal.
The task which does this is \fBapnormalize\fR in the \fBapextract\fR
package.   Note that the lamp observations must first be processed
explicitly for bias and dark count corrections.

Longslit spectra may also suffer the same types of iillumination
problems found in direct imaging.  However, in this case the iillumination
pattern is determined from sky observations (or the flat field itself)
by finding the large scale pattern across the dispersion and at a number
of wavelengths while avoiding the effects of night sky spectrum.  The
task which makes this type of correction in the \fBlongslit\fR package
is \fBiillumination\fR.  This produces an iillumination correction.
To make sky flats or the other types of corrections image arithmetic
is used.  Note also that the sky observations must be explicitly
processed through the flat field stage before computing the iillumination.
