    Added a check that the filename given to the hdmopen() procedure wasn't 
    empty.  This provides a more informative error message than the "floating
    invalid operation' one gets now when e.g. no 'instrument' file is 
    specified (10/12/13, MJF)

src/ccdcache.x
    The 'bufs' pointer was declared as TY_REAL instead of TY_SHORT (5/4/13)

t_cosmicrays.x
    A pointer to a an array of pointers was used in one place as a real.  This
    is an error when integer and real arrays are not of the same size; i.e.
    on 64-bit architectures.  (8/2/12, Valdes)

various
    Separated the generic combine code to a subdirectory as is done
    for imcombine, mscred, etc.  This is only a partial step towards
    sharing the standard imcombine code.  Because this is really old,
    working code that has diverged significantly it will take some time
    to update/merge the new imcombine code.  (1/6/11, Valdes)

=====
V2.15
=====

src/icstat.gx
    Fixed type declarations for the asum() procedures (8/25/09, MJF)

doc/ccdproc.hlp
    Removed the statements that calibration images are not reprocessed
    if they have CCDPROC even if they lack the keywords for specific
    operations.  I looked at the code and did not see much dependence
    on CCDPROC though there could be something I'm missing.  For now,
    since a user reported this, I will assume the behavior reported by
    the user is correct and the documentation is wrong for some historical
    reason.  (5/27/08, Valdes)

x_ccdred.x
    Added the alias qccdproc for use in the quadred.quadproc task.

ccdred/ccdred.hd
    Hooked up help pages for ccdtest package.  (2/14/04, Valdes)

ccdred/ccdtest/t_mkimage.x
    Removed unused variable.  (8/8/02, Valdes)

    There was a confusion with the "output" parameter which is also in
    the ccdproc pset.  Each task now explicitly calls its own output
    parameter.  (7/31/02, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icsetout.x
    When computing offsets the registration point was the reference pixel
    returned by mw_gwterm for the first image.  The code then went on to
    assume this was a logical pixel when comparing with the other images,
    which is not true when there is a physical coordinate system.  The
    algorithm was fixed by converting the reference point to logical
    coordinates.  (4/18/02, Valdes)

ccdred/src/t_ccdmask.x
    Fixed bug where the if the last line or last column had a bad pixel
    without a neighboring interior pixel then the mask value would be
    some number corresponding to the number of pixels in that last line
    or column.  (2/28/02, Valdes)

ccdred/ccdred.cl

ccdred/x_ccdred.x
    Removed COSMICRAYS from package tasks.  The source is still not
    removed.  (8/22/01, Valdes)

ccdred/src/setdark.x
    Added a check for a zero divide in calculating the dark time scaling
    which results in an appropriate error message.  (7/5/01, Valdes)

========
V2.11.3b
========

t_combine.x
    Modified the conversion of pclip from a fraction to a number of images
    because for even number of images the number above/below the median
    is one too small.  (9/26/00, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icmedian.gx
    Replaced with faster Wirth algorithm.  (5/16/00, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icscale.x
ccdred/src/icsetout.x
    Changed declarations for the array "out" to be ARB rather than 3 in
    some places (because it was not changed when another element was added)
    or 4.  This will insure that any future output elements added will
    no require changing these arguments for the sake of cosmetic correctness.
    (1/13/99, Valdes)

ccdred/src/t_combine.x
    Added workaround for error recovery problem that loses the error
    message.  (10/21/99, Valdes)

ccdred$doc/ccdproc.hlp
    The overscan type name was incorrectly given as "average" instead of
    "mean".  This was corrected in the documentation.  (10/15/99, Valdes)

ccdred$src/generic/mkpkg
ccdred$src/cosmic/mkpkg

    Date accidentally changed.  File not modified.  (5/13/99, Valdes)

ccdred$doc/ccdproc.hlp
ccdred$doc/mkskyflat.hlp
    Fixed minor formating problems. (4/22/99, Valdes)

ccdred$src/imcombine/icsetout.x
    The updating of the WCS for offset images was not being done correctly.
    (10/6/98, Valdes)

ccdred$src/t_ccdmask.x
    The overlapping of groups of columns was not quite working because
    you can't overlap imp... calls.  (9/10/98, Valdes)

    2.  The combine scripts all still do in place processing.
    (6/19/98, Valdes)

ccdred$doc/ccdproc.hlp
    Fixed font change typo in Revisions section.  (6/16/98, Valdes)

ccdred$src/t_ccdmask.x
    The test for a bad pixel used && instead of ||.  (4/24/98, Valdes)

ccdred$src/icscale.x
ccdred$doc/combine.hlp
    When zero offsets or weights are specified in a file the weights
    are not modified for zero offsets.  (10/3/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/setoutput.x
    It is now allowed to go from ushort input to short output.
    (9/29/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/t_combine.x
    Fixed a segmentation violation caused by attempting to close the
    mask data structures during error recovery when the error occurs
    before the data structures are defined.  (8/14/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/cosmic/crfind.x
ccdred$src/cosmic/crlist.x
    Changed arguments with adjustable arrays to use ARB.  (8/6/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/setsections.
    Generalized the LTERM update to work with arbitrary WCSDIM.
    (7/24/97, Valdes)

ccdred$x_ccdred.x
    A new task, CCDMASK, has been added.  This task finds deviant pixels
    in CCD data and creates a pixel mask.  (2/21/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/icscale.x
    The ccdmean keyword is now updated rather than deleted.  However
    the ccdmeant keyword is delete to force a later computation if needed.
    (1/7/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/icsetout.x

    The limit on the maximum number of images that can be combined, set by
    the maximum number of logical file descriptors, has been removed.  If
    the condition of too many files is detected the task now automatically
    stacks all the images in a temporary image and then combines them with
    the project option.

    The project option probably did not work previously.  May not still
    work.
    (1/7/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/icsort.gx
    There was an error in the ic_2sort routine when there are exactly
    three images that one of the explicit cases did not properly keep
    the image identifications.  See buglog 344.  (1/17/97, Valdes)

ccdred$src/calimage.x
    The use of SZ_SUBSET-1 can cause problems because the names are
    unique to SZ_SUBSET but if unique part is the SZ_SUBSET character
    this causes problems.  (1/17/97, Valdes)

==========
V2.10.4-p2
==========

ccdred$src/icpclip.gx
    Fixed a bug where a variable was improperly used for two different
    purposes causing the algorithm to fail (bug 316).  (10/19/95, Valdes)

ccdred$src/cosmic/crlist.x
    The output bad pixel data accidentally included some extra fields
    making it incorrect to use the file directly with BADPIXIMAGE.
    The extra diagnostic fields were removed.  (9/25/95, Valdes)

ccdred$src/cosmic/t_cosmicrays.x
    Added a test for interactive mode before opening the graphics
    stream and whether to call the training routine.  This change
    was needed to allow the task to run non-interactively on
    dumb, non-graphics terminals.  (7/24/95, Valdes)

=======
V2.10.4
=======

ccdred$src/t_combine.x
    If an error occurs while opening an input image header the error
    recovery will close all open images and then propagate the error.
    For the case of running out of file descriptors with STF format
    images this will allow the error message to be printed rather
    than the error code.  (4/3/95, Valdes)

ccdred$src/icscale.x
ccdred$doc/combine.hlp
    The behavior of the weights when using both multiplicative and zero
    point scaling was incorrect; the zero levels have to account for
    the scaling.  (3/27/95, Valdes)

ccdred$src/cosmic/t_cosmicrays.x
    There was an error in setting the x,y coordinates of the window
    such that it left some of the coordinates undefined.  This causes
    an FPE on the Alpha.  (2/17/94, Valdes)

ctype.h
ccdred$src/ccdsubsets.x
    Change the test for non-filename characters to map all characters
    but alphabetic, numbers, and period to '_'.  (2/17/95, Valdes)

ccdred$src/proc.gx
    The asum$t function was not properly declared.  (9/13/94, Valdes)

ccdred$src/cosmic/t_cosmicrays.x
ccdred$src/cosmic/crexamine.x
ccdred$doc/cosmicrays.hlp
    1.  A new parameter was added to the crexamine subroutine in the
	previous modification for "training" the program.  In the
	subroutine the parameter was used as a modifyable parameter but it
	was being called with a fixed constant.  The effect was the costant
	value was no longer correct after the first execution and the
	program would act as if a 'q' was typed after the first interactive
	execution.  This was fixed to treat the input argument as input
	only.
    2.  The help page now emphasizes that the "answer" parameter is not
	to be used on the command line and if it is then the task will
	ignored the value and act as if the user always responds with
	"yes".

    Added some new parameters and a new functionality to allow setting
    the flux ratio threshold by training with respect to a user supplied
    list of classifications.  Normally the list would be the image
    display cursor.  (6/29/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/cosmic/t_cosmicrays.x
    Added an imflush() and imseti() after the initial copy of the input
    image to the output is done and before the random access to replace
    the detected cosmic rays.  The imseti sets the image I/O advice to
    RANDOM.  (6/24/94, Valdes)

    Added a CCDMEANT keyword giving the time when the CCDMEAN value was
    calculated.  Routines that later access this keyword check this time
    against the image modify time to determine whether to invalidate
    the value and recompute it.  This solves the problem of people
    modifying the image outside the CCDRED package and possibly using
    an incorrect scaling value.  For backwards compatiblity if the
    new keyword is missing it is assumed to be same as the modify time;
    i.e. the CCDMEAN keyword is valid.  (6/22/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/t_mkillumcor.x
ccdred/src/t_mkillumft.x
ccdred/src/t_mkskycor.x
ccdred/src/t_mkskyflat.x
    Added an extra argument to the millumination subroutine to specify
    whether to print log information.  This is because this procedure
    is used as an intermediate step in things like the fringe correction
    the message is confusing to users.  (6/21/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icsclip.gx
    1.	The restoration of deleted pixels to satisfy the nkeep parameter
	was being done inside the iteration loop causing the possiblity
	of a non-terminating loop; i.e. pixels are rejected, they are
	restored, and the number left then does not statisfy the termination
	condition.  The restoration step was moved following the iterative
	rejection.
    2.	The restoration was also incorrectly when mclip=no and could
	lead to a segmentation violation.
    (6/13/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/iccclip.gx
ccdred/src/icsclip.gx
    Found and fixed another typo bug.  (6/7/94, Valdes/Zhang)

ccdred/src/t_combine.x
    For some reason the clget for the nkeep parameter was deleted
    (it was in V2.10.2 but was gone in the version as of this date).
    It was added again.  (6/6/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icscale.x
    The sigma scaling flag, doscale1, would not be set in the case of
    a mean offset of zero though the scale factors could be different.
    (5/25/94, Valdes/Zhang)

ccdred/src/icsclip.gx

    The reordering step when a central median is used during rejection
    but the final combining is average was incorrect if the number
    of rejected low pixels was greater than the number of pixel
    number of pixels not rejected.  (5/25/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/t_combine.x
    Added a workaround for image header copy problem which leaves part
    of the TEMPNAME keyword in the output image headers.  For an output
    pixel list file this could cause the file to be screwed up.
    (5/6/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icscale.x
ccdred/src/t_combine.x
    1.  There is now a warning error if the scale, zero, or weight type
	is unknown.
    2.  An sfree was being called before the allocated memory was finished
	being used.
    (5/2/94, Valdes)

ccdred/src/iclog.x
    Changed the mean, median, mode, and zero formats from 6g to 7.5g to

ccdred/doc/ccdproc.hlp
    It is an error if no bias section is given or if the whole image is

    For short scan data the task now looks for the number of scan lines
    in the image header.  Also when a calibration image is software
    scanned a new image is created.  This allows processing objects with
    different numbers of scan lines and preserving the unscanned
    calibration image.  (12/15/93, Valdes)

    1.  The output datatypes were extended from just short and real to

    1.  The "outtype" parameter was being ignored and the package "pixeltype"
	parameter was used instead.  This was fixed to use the "outtype"
	parameter.
    2.  The output pixel datatypes now include unsigned short.
    3.  The DARKCOMBINE, FLATCOMBINE, and ZEROCOMBINE scripts specified
	that the output datatype be "real" because of the bug noted
	above the output type was being determined by the package
	"pixeltype" parameter.  The change above fixes this so that
	the combined output will always be real.  The help pages did
	not state that what the output datatype would be so a sentence
	was added specifying the output datatype is real.

    If there were fewer initial pixels than specified by nkeep then the
    task would attempt to add garbage data to achieve nkeep pixels.  This
    could occur when using offsets, bad pixel masks, or thresholds.  The
    code was changed to check against the initial number of pixels rather
    than the number of images.  Also a negative nkeep is no longer
    converted to a positive value based on the number of images.  Instead
    it specifies the maximum number of pixels to reject from the initial
    set of pixels.  (11/8/93, Valdes)

ccdred/doc/ccdproc.hlp
    Added a sentence explicitly saying the fixpix option provides
    the same algorithm as FIXPIX.  (11/1/93, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icscale.x
ccdred/doc/combine.hlp
    The help indicated that user input scale or zero level factors
    by an @file or keyword are multiplicative and additive while the
    task was using then as divisive and subtractive.  This was
    corrected to agree with the intend of the documentation.
    Also the factors are no longer normalized.  (9/24/93, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icsetout.x
    The case in which absolute offsets are specified but the offsets are
    all the same did not work correctly.  (9/24/93, Valdes)

ccdred/doc/geometry.hlp
ccdred/doc/ccdproc.hlp
ccdred/doc/guide.hlp
    The help was modified to say that the overscan region length is
    determine from trimsec and is ignored in biassec.  (9/23/93, Valdes)

ccdred/doc/instruments.hlp
ccdred/doc/subsets.hlp
    Added notes that comments are allowed.  Also if there is more than
    one translation for the same CCDRED parameter the last one takes
    effect.  (9/20/93, Valdes)

ccdred/doc/combine.hlp
    Clarified how bad pixel masks work with the "project" option.
    (9/13/93, Valdes)

ccdred/src/t_combine.x
    The algorithm for making sure there are enough file descriptors failed
    to account for the need to reopen the output image header for an
    update.  Thus when the number of input images + output images + logfile
    was exactly 60 the task would fail.  The update occurs when the output
    image is unmapped so the solution was to close the input images first
    except for the first image whose pointer is used in the new copy of the
    output image.  (8/4/93, Valdes)

============
V2.10.3 beta
============

ccdred/src/icgdata.gx
    There was an indexing error in setting up the ID array when using
    the grow option.  This caused the CRREJECT/CCDCLIP algorithm to
    fail with a floating divide by zero error when there were non-zero
    shifts.  (5/26/93, Valdes)

ccdred/src/icmedian.gx
    The median calculation is now done so that the original input data
    is not lost.  This slightly greater inefficiency is required so
    that an output sigma image may be computed if desired.  (5/10/93, Valdes)

    The weighting was changed from using the square root of the exposure time

    to variance weighting.  Other options for specifying the scaling and
    weighting factors were added; namely from a file or from a different
    image header keyword.  The \fInkeep\fR parameter was added to allow
    controlling the maximum number of pixels to be rejected by the clipping
    algorithms.  The \fIsnoise\fR parameter was added to include a sensitivity

    1.  There was a recursion problem caused by the absence of the CCDPROC
	flag in a zero level image which did not need any processing
	because there was no trimming, overscan subtraction, or bad
	pixel correction.  The procedure CCDPROC left the image
	unmodified (no CCDPROC flag) which meant that later another unprocessed
	calibration image would again try to process it leading to
	recursion.  Since I was uncomfortable with relying on the
	CCDPROC flag I added the routine CCDCHECK to actually check
	each processing flag against the defined operations.  This will
	also allow additional automatic processing of calibration
	images if the users sets new flags after an initial pass
	through the data.  The CCDPROC flag is still set in the data
	but it is not used.
    2.  It is possible in data which has no object types for the flat
	field image never to have its mean computed for later scaling.
	There were two modifications to address this problem.  If an
	image is processed without a ccdtype then the mean will be
	computed at a very small cost in time.  If the image is later
	used as a flat field this information will then be present.
	Second, if a flat field calibration image does not have the
	mean value, even if it has been processed, the mean value
	will still be calculated.
    3.  In looking at the recursion problem I realized that some of
	the calibration images could be opened more than once, though
	READ_ONLY, once for the image being processed and later if the
	task has to backtrack to process a another calibration frame.  I
	was surprise that this was not found on VMS until I realized
	that for OIF format images the image header is read and the
	file is then closed.  No file is actually left open until pixel
	I/O is done.  However, this should cause STF images to fail on
	VMS because VMS does not allow a file to be open more than once
	and the STF image header is kept open.  I rewrote the image
	caching interface to cache the IMIO pointer even if the pixel
	data was not cached.  This will insure any calibration image
	is only opened once even if it is accessed independently from
	different parts of the program.
    4.  The error message when using fringe and illumination correction
	images which have not been processed by MKFRINGECOR and
	MKILLUMCOR was misleading when refering to the absence of the
	MKFRINGE and MKILLUM flag.  A user thought that the missing
