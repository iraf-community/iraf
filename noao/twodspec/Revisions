noao$twodspec/apextract/*
    Valdes, September 16, 1986
    1.  A new version of the package has been installed.  It is very
	different from the old version.  The user parameter files must
	be unlearned.

twodspec:  Valdes, July 21, 1986:
    1.  The older version of APEXTRACT has been removed.

=============================================
STScI pre-release and Version 2.3 SUN release
=============================================

twodspec:  Valdes, June 20, 1986:
    1.  New APEXTRACT installed.  This version includes background
	subtraction and new ICFIT.  The older version is still available.

twodspec:  Valdes, March 27, 1986:
    1.  Replaced SETIMHDR with SETDISP.  This task is now used in both
	ONEDSPEC and TWODSPEC.

twodspec:  Valdes, March 21, 1986:
    1.  New aperture extraction package APEXTRACT.  This replaces EXTRACT
	and TRACE.
    2.  SETIMHDR moved from LONGSLIT to TWODSPEC.  It is my intention that
	all tasks in this package (except background which is based on a
	script in generic) use the header parameter DISPAXIS.  This means
	both APEXTRACT and LONGSLIT.  MULTISPEC will probably not change since
	it is an ancient package.
