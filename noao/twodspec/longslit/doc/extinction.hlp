List of output extinction corrected images.  Output images may be the
same as the input images.

DESCRIPTION
The specified images are corrected for atmospheric extinction according
to the formula

    correction factor = 10 ** (0.4 * airmass * extinction)

where the extinction is a tabulated function of the wavelength.  The
extinction file contains lines of wavelength and extinction at that
wavelength.  The units of the wavelength must be the same as those of
the dispersion corrected images; i.e. Angstroms.   If the image is
dispersion corrected in logarithmic wavelength intervals (DC-FLAG = 1)
the task will convert to wavelength and so the extinction file must
still be wavelength.  The table values are interpolated
to the wavelengths of the image pixels and the correction applied to
the pixel values.  Note that the image pixel values are modifed.

The airmass is sought in the image header under the name AIRMASS.  If the
airmass is not found then it is computed from the zenith distance (ZD in hours)
using the approximation formula from Allen's "Astrophysical Quantities", 1973,
page125 and page 133

	AIRMASS = sqrt (cos (ZD) ** 2 + 2 * scale + 1)

where the atmospheric scale height is set to be 750.  If the parameter ZD
is not found then it must be computed from the hour angle (HA in hours),
the declination (DEC in degrees), and the observation latitude (LATITUDE
in degress).   The hour angle may be computed from the right ascension
(RA in hours) and siderial time (ST in hours).  Computed quantities are
recorded in the image header.  Flags indicating extinction correction are
also set in the image header.

The image header keyword DISPAXIS must be present with a value of 1 for
dispersion parallel to the lines (varying with the column coordinate) or 2
for dispersion parallel to the columns (varying with line coordinate).
This parameter may be added using \fBhedit\fR.  Note that if the image has
been transposed (\fBimtranspose\fR) the dispersion axis should still refer
to the original dispersion axis unless the physical world coordinate system
is first reset (see \fBwcsreset\fR).  This is done in order to allow images
which have DISPAXIS defined prior to transposing to still work correctly
without requiring this keyword to be changed.

EXAMPLES
1. A set of dispersion corrected images is extinction corrected in-place as
follows:

.nf
	cl> extinction img* img*
.fi

2. To keep the uncorrected image:

.nf
	cl> extinction nite1.004 nite1ext.004
.fi

3.  If the DISPAXIS keyword is missing and the dispersion is running
vertically (varying with the image lines):

.nf
	cl> hedit *.imh dispaxis 2 add+
.fi
