NAME
lscombine -- Combine longslit images
.ih
USAGE
lscombine input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input two-dimensional images to combine.  This task is typically
used with dispersion calibrated longslit images though it will work with
any 2D images.
.le
.ls output
Output combined image.
.le
.ls headers = "" (optional)
Optional output multiextension FITS file where each extension is a dataless
headers from each input image.
.le
.ls bpmasks = "" (optional)
Optional output bad pixel mask with good values of 0 and bad values of 1.
Output pixels are marked as bad when no input pixels contributed to the
output pixel.  The file name is also added to the output image header under
the keyword BPM.
.le
.ls rejmask = "" (optional)
Optional output mask file identifying rejected or excluded pixels.  The
pixel mask is the size of the output image but there is one extra dimension
with length equal to the number of input images.  Each element of the
highest dimension is a mask corresponding to an input image with values of
1 for rejected or excluded pixels and values of 0 for pixels which were
used.  The order of the masks is the order of the input images and image
header keywords, indexed by the pixel coordinate of the highest dimension
identify the input images.  Note that the pixel positions are in the output
pixel coordinate system.
.le
.ls nrejmasks = "" (optional)
Optional output pixel mask giving the number of input pixels rejected or
excluded from the input images.
.le
.ls expmasks = "" (optional)
Optional output exposure mask giving the sum of the exposure values of
the input images with non-zero weights that contributed to that pixel.
Since masks are integer, the exposure values may be scaled to preserve
dynamic range and fractional significance.  The scaling values are given in
the header under the keywords MASKSCAL and MASKZERO.  Exposure values are
computed from the mask values by scale * value + zero where scale is the
value of the MASKSCAL keyword and zero is the value of the MASKZERO
keyword.
.le
.ls sigma = "" (optional)
Optional output sigma image.  The sigma is the standard deviation,
corrected for a finite population, of the input pixel values (excluding
rejected pixels) about the output combined pixel values.
.le

.ls logfile = "STDOUT" (optional)
Optional output log file.  If no file is specified then no log information is
produced.  The special filename "STDOUT" prints log information to the
terminal.
.le

.ls interptype = "spline3"
Image interpolation type for any resampling prior to combining.
The allowed types are "nearest" (nearest neighbor), "linear" (bilinear),
"poly3" (bicubic polynomial), "poly5" (biquintic polynomial), and "spline3"
(bicubic polynomial).
.le
.ls x1 = INDEF, y1 = INDEF
User coordinates of the first output column and line.  If INDEF then it
is based on the smallest value over all the images.
.le
.ls x2 = INDEF, y2 = INDEF
User coordinates of the last output column and line.  If INDEF then it
is based on the largest value over all the images.
.le
.ls dx = INDEF, dy = INDEF
User coordinate pixel interval of the output.  If INDEF then the it
is based on smallest interval (i.e. highest dispersion) over all the images.
.le
.ls nx = INDEF, ny = INDEF
Number of output pixels.  If INDEF then it is based on the values of the
other coordinate parameters.
.le

.ls combine = "average" (average|median|sum)
Type of combining operation performed on the final set of pixels (after
offsetting, masking, thresholding, and rejection).  The choices are
"average", "median", or "sum".  The median uses the average of the two central
values when the number of pixels is even.  For the average and sum, the
pixel values are multiplied by the weights (1 if no weighting is used)
and summed.  The average is computed by dividing by the sum of the weights.
If the sum of the weights is zero then the unweighted average is used.
.le
.ls reject = "none" (none|minmax|ccdclip|crreject|sigclip|avsigclip|pclip)
Type of rejection operation performed on the pixels remaining after offsetting,
masking and thresholding.  The algorithms are described in the
DESCRIPTION section.  The rejection choices are:

.nf
      none - No rejection
    minmax - Reject the nlow and nhigh pixels
   ccdclip - Reject pixels using CCD noise parameters
  crreject - Reject only positive pixels using CCD noise parameters
   sigclip - Reject pixels using a sigma clipping algorithm
 avsigclip - Reject pixels using an averaged sigma clipping algorithm
     pclip - Reject pixels using sigma based on percentiles
.fi

.le
.ls outtype = "real" (none|short|ushort|integer|long|real|double)
Output image pixel datatype.  The pixel datatypes are "double", "real",
"long", "integer", unsigned short "ushort", and "short" with highest
precedence first.  If "none" is specified then the highest precedence
datatype of the input images is used.  When there is a mixture of
short and unsigned short images the highest precedence become integer.
The datatypes may be abbreviated to a single character.
.le
.ls outlimits = ""
Output region limits in pixels specified as pairs of whitespace separated
values.  The first two numbers are the limits along the first output image
dimension, the next two numbers are the limits along the second dimension,
and so on.  If the higher dimension limits are not specified they default
to the full range.  Therefore, if no limits are specified then the full
output is created.  Note that the output size is computed from all the
input images including offsets if specified and the coordinates are
relative to that size.
.le
.ls masktype = "none" (none|goodvalue)
Type of pixel masking to use.  If "none" then no pixel masking is done
even if an image has an associated  pixel mask.  Otherwise the
value "goodvalue" will use any mask specified for the image under
the BPM keyword.  The values of the mask will be interpreted as
zero for good pixels and non-zero for bad pixels.  The mask pixels
are assumed to be registered with the image pixels.
.le
.ls blank = 0.
Output value to be used when there are no pixels.
.le

.ls scale = "none" (none|mode|median|mean|exposure|@<file>|!<keyword>)
Multiplicative image scaling to be applied.  The choices are none, multiply
by the reciprocal of the mode, median, or mean of the specified statistics
section, multiply by the reciprocal of the exposure time in the image header,
multiply by the values in a specified file, or multiply by a specified
image header keyword.  When specified in a file the scales must be one per
line in the order of the input images.
.le
.ls zero = "none" (none|mode|median|mean|@<file>|!<keyword>)
Additive zero level image shifts to be applied.  The choices are none, add
the negative of the mode, median, or mean of the specified statistics
section, add the values given in a file, or add the values given by an
image header keyword.  When specified in a file the zero values must be one
per line in the order of the input images.  File or keyword zero offset
values do not allow a correction to the weights.
.le
.ls weight = "none" (none|mode|median|mean|exposure|@<file>|!<keyword>)
Weights to be applied during the final averaging.  The choices are none,
the mode, median, or mean of the specified statistics section, the exposure
time, values given in a file, or values given by an image header keyword.
When specified in a file the weights must be one per line in the order of
the input images and the only adjustment made by the task is for the number of
images previously combined.   In this case the weights should be those
appropriate for the scaled images which would normally be the inverse
of the variance in the scaled image.
.le
.ls statsec = ""
Section of images to use in computing image statistics for scaling and
weighting.  If no section is given then the entire region of the input is
sampled (for efficiency the images are sampled if they are big enough).
When the images are offset relative to each other one can precede the image
section with one of the modifiers "input", "output", "overlap".  The first
interprets the section relative to the input image (which is equivalent to
not specifying a modifier), the second interprets the section relative to
the output image, and the last selects the common overlap and any following
section is ignored.
.le
.ls  expname = ""
Image header keyword to be used with the exposure scaling and weighting
options.  Also if an exposure keyword is specified that keyword will be
added to the output image using a weighted average of the input exposure
values.
.le

.ce
Algorithm Parameters
.ls lthreshold = INDEF, hthreshold = INDEF
Low and high thresholds to be applied to the input pixels.  This is done
before any scaling, rejection, and combining.  If INDEF the thresholds
are not used.
.le
.ls nlow = 1,  nhigh = 1 (minmax)
The number of low and high pixels to be rejected by the "minmax" algorithm.
These numbers are converted to fractions of the total number of input images
so that if no rejections have taken place the specified number of pixels
are rejected while if pixels have been rejected by masking, thresholding,
or nonoverlap, then the fraction of the remaining pixels, truncated
to an integer, is used.
.le
.ls nkeep = 1
The minimum number of pixels to retain or the maximum number to reject
when using the clipping algorithms (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip,
avsigclip, or pclip).  When given as a positive value this is the minimum
number to keep.  When given as a negative value the absolute value is
the maximum number to reject.  The latter is in addition to pixels
missing due to non-overlapping offsets, bad pixel masks, or thresholds.
.le
.ls mclip = yes (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigcliip)
Use the median as the estimate for the true intensity rather than the
average with high and low values excluded in the "ccdclip", "crreject",
"sigclip", and "avsigclip" algorithms?  The median is a better estimator
in the presence of data which one wants to reject than the average.
However, computing the median is slower than the average.
.le
.ls lsigma = 3., hsigma = 3. (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigclip, pclip)
Low and high sigma clipping factors for the "ccdclip", "crreject", "sigclip",
"avsigclip", and "pclip" algorithms.  They multiply a "sigma" factor
produced by the algorithm to select a point below and above the average or
median value for rejecting pixels.  The lower sigma is ignored for the
"crreject" algorithm.
.le
.ls rdnoise = "0.", gain = "1.", snoise = "0." (ccdclip, crreject)
CCD readout noise in electrons, gain in electrons/DN, and sensitivity noise
as a fraction.  These parameters are used with the "ccdclip" and "crreject"
algorithms.  The values may be either numeric or an image header keyword
which contains the value.  The noise model for a pixel is:

.nf
    variance in DN = (rdnoise/gain)^2 + DN/gain + (snoise*DN)^2
    variance in e- = (rdnoise)^2 + (gain*DN) + (snoise*(gain*DN))^2
		   = rdnoise^2 + Ne + (snoise * Ne)^2
.fi

where DN is the data number and Ne is the number of electrons.  Sensitivity
noise typically comes from noise introduced during flat fielding.
.le
.ls sigscale = 0.1 (ccdclip, crreject, sigclip, avsigclip)
This parameter determines when poisson corrections are made to the
computation of a sigma for images with different scale factors.  If all
relative scales are within this value of unity and all relative zero level
offsets are within this fraction of the mean then no correction is made.
The idea is that if the images are all similarly though not identically
scaled, the extra computations involved in making poisson corrections for
variations in the sigmas can be skipped.  A value of zero will apply the
corrections except in the case of equal images and a large value can be
used if the sigmas of pixels in the images are independent of scale and
zero level.
.le
.ls pclip = -0.5 (pclip)
Percentile clipping algorithm parameter.  If greater than
one in absolute value then it specifies a number of pixels above or
below the median to use for computing the clipping sigma.  If less
than one in absolute value then it specifies the fraction of the pixels
above or below the median to use.  A positive value selects a point
above the median and a negative value selects a point below the median.
The default of -0.5 selects approximately the quartile point.
.le
.ls grow = 0.
Radius in pixels for additional pixel to be rejected in an image with a
rejected pixel from one of the rejection algorithms.  This applies only to
pixels rejected by one of the rejection algorithms and not the masked or
threshold rejected pixels.
.le

DESCRIPTION
\fBLSCOMBINE\fR combines two-dimensional longslit images by first
resampling them to a common world coordinate system, if not already on
the same system, and then combining the matching pixels.  The final world
coordinate system is specified by parameters or by looking at the maximum
ranges and minimum intervals over the input data.

Algorithmically it is a combination of the tasks \fBTRANSFORM\fR (using
the WCS) and \fBIMCOMBINE\fR.  When executing it will generate temporary
images ("lsc*") and masks ("mlsc*") if the images are not already on a
common world coordinate system.  The user only need be aware of this
in case of an unexpected abort leaving these files behind.

Rather than repeat the details the user should consult the descriptions
for \fBTRANSFORM\fR and \fBIMCOMBINE\fR ignoring parameters which are
not part of this task.
