PARAMETERS
.ls images
Images to use in determining illumination calibrations.  These are
generally sky spectra.  An image section may be used to select only a
portion of the image.
.le
.ls illuminations
Iillumination calibration images to be created.  Each illumination image is
paired with a calibration image.  If the image exists then it will be modified
otherwise it is created.
.le
.ls interactive = yes
Graph the average spectrum and select the dispersion bins
and graph and fit the slit profile for each dispersion bin interactively?
.le
.ls bins = ""
Range string defining the dispersions bins within which the slit profiles
are determined.  If the range string is null then the dispersion
bins are determined by the parameter \fInbins\fR.
.le
.ls nbins = 5
If the dispersion bins are not specified explicitly by the parameter
\fIbins\fR then the dispersion range is divided into this number of
nearly equal bins.
.le
.ls sample = "*"
Sample of points to use in fitting each slit profile.
The sample is selected with a range string.
.le
.ls naverage = 1
Number of sample points to average or median before fitting a function.
If the number is positive the average of each set of naverage sample
points is formed while if the number is negative then the median of each set
of points (in absolute value) is formed.  This subsample of points is
used in fitting the slit profile.

CURSOR KEYS
The interactive curve fitting package \fBicfit\fR is used to fit a function
to the average calibration spectrum.  Additional help on using this package
and the cursor keys is available under the name "icfit".

When the dispersion bins are set graphically the following cursor keys are
defined.

.ls ?
Clear the screen and print a menu of the cursor options.
.le
.ls i
Initialize the sample ranges.
.le
.ls q
Exit interactive dispersion bin selection.
.le
.ls s
Set a bin with the cursor.  This may be repeated any number of times.
Two keystrokes are required to mark the two ends of the bin.
.le

The parameters are listed or set with the following commands which may be
abbreviated.  To list the value of a parameter type the command alone.

DESCRIPTION
An illumination calibration, in the form of an image, is created for each
longslit calibration image, normally a sky spectrum.  The illumination
calibration is determined by fitting functions across the slit (the slit
profiles) at a number of points along the dispersion, normalizing each fitted
function to unity at the center of the slit, and interpolating the illumination
between the dispersion points.  The fitted data is formed by dividing the
dispersion points into a set of bins and averaging the slit profiles within
each bin.  The interpolation type is a user parameter.

The image header keyword DISPAXIS must be present with a value of 1 for
dispersion parallel to the lines (varying with the column coordinate) or 2
for dispersion parallel to the columns (varying with line coordinate).
This parameter may be added using \fBhedit\fR.  Note that if the image has
been transposed (\fBimtranspose\fR) the dispersion axis should still refer
to the original dispersion axis unless the physical world coordinate system
is first reset (see \fBwcsreset\fR).  This is done in order to allow images
which have DISPAXIS defined prior to transposing to still work correctly
without requiring this keyword to be changed.

If the output image does not exist it is first created with unit illumination
everywhere.  Subsequently the illumination is only modified in those regions
occupied by the input image.  Thus, an image section in the input image may
be used to select the data to be used and for which an illumination calibration
will be determined.  This ability is particularly userful when dealing with
multiple slits or to exclude regions outside the slit.

The dispersion bins may be selected by a range string (\fIbins\fR) or,
if no range string is given, by the number of bins into which the dispersion
range is to be divided (\fInbins\fR).  When the interactive parameter
is set (\fIinteractive\fR) then the average spectrum is graphed and the
bins may be set using the cursor or with a colon command.  Once the bins
have been selected exit with (q)uit to continue to the slit profile fitting.

Fitting of the slit profiles is done using the interactive curve fitting
package (\fBicfit\fR).  The parameters determining the fit are the
sample points, the averaging bin size, the fitting function,
the order of the function, the rejection sigmas, the number of
rejection iterations, and the rejection width.
The sample points for the average slit profile are selected by a range string.  
Points in the slit profile not in the sample are not used in determining
the fitted function.  The selected sample points may be binned into a
set of averages or medians which are used in the function fit instead of the
sample points with the averaging bin size parameter
\fInaverage\fR.  This parameter selects the number of sample points to be
averaged if its value is positive or the number of points to be medianed
if its value is negative (naturally, the absolute value is used for the
number of points).  A value of one uses all sample points without binning.
The fitted function may be used to reject points from the fit using the
parameters \fIlow_reject, high_reject, niterate\fR and \fIgrow\fR.  If
one or both of the rejection limits are greater than zero then the sigma
of the residuals is computed and points with residuals less than
\fI-low_reject\fR times the sigma and greater than \fIhigh_reject\fR times
the sigma are removed and the function fitted again.  In addition points
within a distance given by the parameter \fIgrow\fR of the a rejected point
are also rejected.  A value of zero for this parameter rejects only the
points exceeding the rejection threshold.  Finally, the rejection procedure
may be iterated the number of times given by the parameter \fIniterate\fR.

The fitted functions may be examined and modified interactively when the
parameter \fIinteractive\fR is set.  The user is asked before each dispersion
bin whether to perform the fit interactively.  The possible response are
"no", "yes", "NO", and "YES".  The lower case responses only affect the
specified dispersion bin while the upper case responses affect all following
dispersion bins for the current image.  Thus, if the response is "NO" then
no further prompts or interactive curve fitting need be performed while if
the response is "YES" there are no further prompts but the slit profile
for each dispersion bin must be graphed and exited with (q)uit.
Changes to the fitting parameters remain in effect until they are next
changed.  This allows the fitting parameters to be selected from only the first
dispersion bin without requiring each dispersion bin to be graphed and
confirmed.

When a dispersion bin is to be fitted interactively the average slit profile
and the fitted function or the residuals of the fit are graphed.
Deleted points are marked with an x and rejected points by a diamond.
The sample regions are indicated along the bottom of the graph.
The cursor keys and colon commands are used to change the values
of the fitting parameters, delete points, and window and expand the
graph.  When the fitted function is satisfactory exit with
with a carriage return or 'q'.  The prompt for the next dispersion bin will
then be given until the last dispersion bin has been fit.  The illumination
calibration image is then created.

EXAMPLES
1. To create an illumination image non-interactively:

.nf
	cl> illumination sky illum nbins=8 order=20 interactive=no
.fi

2. To determine independent illuminations for a multislit image determine the
image sections defining each slit.  Then the illumination functions are
computed as follows:

.nf
	cl> illumination sky[10:20,*],sky[35:45,*] illum,illum
.fi

3. Generally the slit image sections are prepared in a file which is then
used to define the lists of input images and illuminations.

.nf
	cl> illumination @slits @illums
.fi

3.  If the DISPAXIS keyword is missing and the dispersion is running
vertically (varying with the image lines):

.nf
	cl> hedit *.imh dispaxis 2 add+
.fi
