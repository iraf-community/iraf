transform/trsetup.x
    Conversion between natural and log coordinates had precision problems.
    The conversions are now done in double precision.  Added limits to
    insure the interpolation coordinates for msivector remain in the
    image.  (8/7/07, Valdes)

transform/fcgetcoords.x
    The previous change failed to reset the axis mapping which causes the
    transformation from physical to logical to fail when the trace axis
    is 2.  (6/14/06, Valdes)

getdaxis.x
    Put an error check to avoid an error when the WCS is 3D.  (9/22/05, Valdes)

transform/igsfit/igsfit.x
    The computation of the rms was not handling deleted points.
    (7/14/05, Valdes)

standard.par
    The file needed to be updated for the changes in the task for supporting
    IR reductions.  (9/10/04, Valdes)

    1.  Added the new task LSCOMBINE to register and combine longslit data.
    	This is a combination of the functions in TRANSFORM for resampling
	and IMCOMBINE for combining.

doc/transform.hlp
    1.  Added the parameters "minput" and "moutput".  This allows masks
    	to be transformed using the same transformation as the data.  The
	transformation procedures were modified to allow doing this
	efficiently; i.e. doing it in parallel with the data transformation
	using the same internal coordinate lookup maps.
    2.  Added the parameter "blank" to allow setting the value for output
    	pixels interpolated from outside the input image.  The value
	INDEF produces the old behavior or extrapolating from the nearest
	edge pixel in the input image.
    3.  If no "fitnames" are specified the tasks now uses the WCS for
    	defining the transformation.  This allows resampling dispersion
	calibrated longslit data.
    4.  The routines were restructured to allow calling the setup and
    	resampling from another task such as LSCOMBINE.

longslit$transform/fcdlist.x
    The check between a deleted point and the values read from the IDENTIFY
    database are no tolerance checked.  See bug 485.  (8/15/01, Valdes)

longslit$transform/t_transform.x
    1.  Instead of using 50 sample points across the image for the sampled
    inversion points the algorithm now sets a step near 10.  In the
    former method the sampling would become too crude with larger
    images.
    2.  Formerly the inversion would quit after one or two iterations if
    the point falls off the edge.  This can lead to bad interpolation at
    the edges if the distortion and requested output samples outside the
    input image.  The edge check has been removed.

response.x
doc/response.hlp
    Change the behavior of the task with respect to the threshold parameter
    to agree with the help page.  Previously it replaced values below
    the threshold by the threshold value in both the normalization and
    the data prior to dividing.  The result would not be a unit response
    unless both the data and normalization were below the threshold.
    The new behavior gives a unit response if either the normalization
    or data are below the threshold.  The help page was slightly
    modified to make the behavior even clearer.  (5/15/97, Valdes)

    (2/12/93, Valdes)

transform/fcgetcoords.x
    If the combine option is used and the images do not all have the same
    fit axis then a segmentation error would occur because of a mistake
    in where the MWCS and IMIO pointers are closed.  This was fixed
    and a warning message added.  (12/7/92, Valdes)

transform/fcgetcoords.x
    Features with INDEF user values are now excluded.

    The output pixel type is now of type real.  If the input image is
    to be modified the calibration is done on a temporary image and
    renamed to the input image upon completion rather than being done
    in place.  Previously, flux calibrating a type short image would
    produce an image of all zeros.  (3/19/92, Valdes)

longslit$longslit.par

    (2/6/92, Valdes)

longslit$transform/fcgetcoords.x
    In V2.10 IDENTIFY/REIDENTIFY measure feature positions in physical
    coordinates while FITCOORDS and TRANSFORM require logical coordinates.
    Therefore, the IDENTIFY database coordinates are transformed to
    logical coordinates when they are read.  (12/20/91, Valdes)

longslit$transform/igsfit/igsfit.x

longslit$transform/t_transform.x
    Changed the computation of x1, x2 and y1, y2 to natural units if logx and
    logy were set to yes. These numbers were being erroneously computed in
    log units leading to an erroneous transformation if the user specified the
    coordinate limits with x1,nx,dx and y1,ny,dy. (10/26/88 Davis)

    The task TRANSFORM in  the  LONGSLIT  package  is  used  to
    interpolate images  onto a user defined coordinate system given as
    surface functions U(X,Y)  and  V(X,Y)  where  (X,Y)  are  the
    untransformed  image  pixel coordinates  and  (U,V) are the user
    coordinates.  The surface functions are derived from a set of measured
    points  using  the  task  FITCOORDS.  With  Version  2.6  of  IRAF
    the  algorithm  used  to  invert  the user coordinate surfaces, U(X,Y)
    and V(X,Y) --> X(U,V) and Y(U,V),  has  been changed.   Previously,
    surfaces  function  of  comparable  order to the original surfaces were
    fit to a grid of points,  i.e.  (U(X,Y),  V(X,Y), X)  and (U(X,Y),
    V(X,Y), Y), with the same surface fitting routines used in FITCOORDS to
    obtain the input user coordinate surfaces.  This  method of  inversion
    worked  well in all cases in which reasonable distortions and
    dispersions were used.  It was selected because  it  was  relatively
    fast.   However,  it  cannot  be  proved  to  work  in all cases; in
    one instance in  which  an  invalid  surface  was  used  the
    inversion  was actually  much poorer than expected.  Therefore, a more
    direct iterative inversion algorithm is  now  used.   This  is
    guaranteed  to  give  the correct  inversion  to  within a set error
    (0.05 of a pixel in X and Y).  It is slightly slower than the previous
    algorithm but it  is  still  not as major a factor as the image
    interpolation itself.

    The  event  which  triggered  this  change was when a user
    misidentified some arc lines.  The dispersion function which was
    forced  to  fit  the misidentified   lines   required  curvatures  of
    a  couple  of  hundred angstroms over 100 pixels at a dispersion of
    10  angstroms  per  pixel.  It  was  possible  to do this to the user's
    satisifaction with a surface function of xorder=6 and yorder=7.
    TRANSFORM inverts  this  surface  by fitting  a  function  with the
    same orders (it uses a minimum of order 6 and the order of the  input
    surface  function).   The  transformed  arc image  was  then examined
    and found to have residual wavelength errors 5 times larger expected
    from the residuals  in  the  dispersion  solution.  With  such  a
    large  curvature  in  the  dispersion surface function it turned out
    that to  maintain  errors  at  the  same  level  the  fitting function
    required  orders of 12.  (To determine this required a special version
    of TRANSFORM  and  the  new  double  precision  surface  fitting
    routines).   When  the  lines  were  correctly identified the
    dispersion function had much lower curvatures and required lower orders
    in the  fit and  gave a good transformation of the arc image.  The
    conclusions drawn from this event are:

    1. An incorrect dispersion solution can appear  to  be  correct  if
    the misidentified lines are at the end and a high enough order is
    used.

    2.   This  requires  high  order  surface  functions  in  FITCOORDS
    and TRANSFORM.

    3.  The algorithm used in TRANSFORM  in  V2.5  and  earlier,  while
    not failing,  does  give  unexpectly  large  residuals in the
    linearized arc spectrum in this case.  A cautious user should transform
    arc images  and examine them.

    4.   In  the  future  a more direct inversion algorithm is guaranteed
    to give residuals in the transform consistent with  the  residuals  in
    the dispersion solution even when the dispersion function is not
    realistic.

transform/fitcoords.x,fcgetcoords.x,fcgetim.x: Valdes, July 1, 1986
    1.  Added routine to remove image extensions.  This was necessary
	to prevent having two legal image names and to avoid creating
	database files with the image extensions.

=====================================
STScI Pre-release and SUN 2.3 Release
=====================================

longslit$illumination.x:  Valdes, June 17, 1986:
    1.  It was possible to request a higher order image interpolator
	than the number of bins being interpolated causing an error.
	A check was added to use a lower order interpolator if the
	number of bins is too small.

longslit$*.ext; Valdes June 2, 1986
    1.  Moved the extinction data files to "noao$lib/onedstds/".
	Modified the parameter file for EXTINCTION appropriately.

longslit$fluxcalib.x:  Valdes, May 13, 1986
    1.  Modified FLUXCALIB to allow any combination of log or linear wavelength
	coordinates for the input image and the sensitivity image.

longslit$fluxcalib.x:  Valdes, May 1, 1986
    1.  Modified FLUXCALIB to use image templates instead of file templates.

longslit$tranform/transform.par: Valdes, May 1, 1986
    1.  Changed default value of parameter database to "database" from
	"identify.db"
    2.  Changed help page to reflect change in default parameter.

longslit$tranform/transform.x: Valdes, April 21, 1986
    1.  Task TRANSFORM crashed when flux conservation was turned off.  This
	was caused at the end by attempting to free memory allocated for
	flux conservation.  The transformed image is still ok.  This
	bug has been fixed.
    2.  Help page for TRANSFORM updated to include timing information.

longslit$ilsetbins.x: Valdes, April 7, 1986
    1.  Fixed use of STRIDX with a character constant to STRIDXS.

longslit: Valdes, Mar 24, 1986
    1.  RESPONSE, ILLUMINATION, EXTINCTION, and FLUXCALIB modified to
	fix history writing bug.

longslit: Valdes, Mar 21, 1986
    1.  APDEFINE, APEXTRACT, and SETIMHDR removed from this package.
    2.  APDEFINE, APEXTRACT, and SETIMHDR help pages removed.
    3.  LONGSLIT menu revised.

longslit$response.x: Valdes, Mar 20, 1986
    1.  There was a bug in RESPONSE which turned the interactive fitting
	off if the answer was only "no" instead of "NO".  This has been
	fixed.
    
longslit$illumination.x:  Valdes, Mar 11, 1986
    1.  ILLUMINATION has a new parameter for the interpolation type.
    2.  The help page for ILLUMINATION has been updated

===========
Release 2.2
===========
From Valdes Feb 11, 1986:

1.  APEXTRACT sets the BEAM_NUM beam number to zero for all extractions.
The aperture numbers are used to generate the record extensions.
------
From Valdes Feb 7, 1986:

1.  Images package loaded with longslit.
------
From Valdes Feb 3, 1986:

1.  Fixed bug in setting the aperture number in APDEFINE.  It was interpreting
the input value as a real number and storing it in an integer variable.
------
From Valdes Jan 23, 1986:

1.  Buffering limits removed in TRANSFORM.

2.  Bug fixed in coordinate setting in TRANSFORM.

3.  Bug fixed in undeleting points in FITCOORDS.
------
From Valdes Jan 3, 1986:

1.  FITCOORDS has been modified.  The 'z' zoom option now queries for
the type of zoom.  The types are feature, constant x, constant y, and
constant z.  This allows examining dispersion solutions at different
columns or lines.
------
From Valdes Nov 20, 1985:

1.  TRANSFORM now exits with an error if a database record is not found
rather than giving a warning and continuing on.
------
From Valdes Nov 15, 1985:

1.  FITCOORDS and TRANSFORM modified to use directory/text databases
rather than single text databases.  This new database structure is what
is now created by IDENTIFY and REIDENTIFY.
------
From Valdes Nov 7, 1985:

1.  The task MKSCRIPT has been made a basic system task.  It is no longer
loaded in the LONGSLIT package but is always available.
------
From Valdes Nov 1, 1985:

1.  New task MKSCRIPT has been added.  It is loaded out of the IMRED.GENERIC
package.  See the help page for the task and the revisions for GENERIC.

2.  Task FITCOORDS has been modified in several ways:
	a.  The images in a list of images can be fit separately or
	    combined into a single fit based on the value of the parameter
	    COMBINE.
	b.  Points delete interactively are recorded in a deletion list
	    and may be used in subsequent fits.
	c.  The last interactive plot or a default non-interactive plot
	    is recorded in a plotfile (if specified).  The plots in the
	    plot file can be spool or examined after the fact.

See the new help for this task.
------
From Valdes Oct 22, 1985:

1.  New parameter "exposure" in FLUXCALIB.  This parameter specifies the
image header keyword corresponding to the exposure time to be used in
calibrating the images.

2.  FLUXCALIB and EXTINCTION have been changed to take a list of input
images and a list of output images.  The output images may be the same
as the input images.
------
From Valdes Oct 4, 1985:

1.  Response and illumination modified to include the parameters for
low and high rejection and rejection iteration.
------
From Valdes Oct 1, 1985:

1.  The package has been reorganized.  Task extract has been moved to
a new package twodspec.echelle.  The source code for identify and reidentify,
which are actually one dimensional tools, have been moved to the onedspec
package though they are still loaded with the twodspec package.

2.  New task fluxcalib flux calibrates long slit images using the flux
calibration file produced by onedspec.sensfunc.

3.  Illumination can now handle using a single illumination bin.

4.  Task revisions renamed to revs.  Note that this is a temporary task.
------
From Valdes September 25, 1985:

1.  New task setimages added.  This task sets parameters in the image headers
defining the dispersion axis and, optionally, strings for the coordinate
types and coordinate units.  This strings, if defined, are used in other
tasks for identifying and labeling graphs.

2.  Because the dispersion axis is now defined in the header the axis
parameter in tasks response and illumination have been removed.

3.  Task transform now adds coordinate information to the image headers.

4.  New task extinction corrects images for extinction.

------
From Valdes September 23, 1985:

1.  Reidentify has been significantly speeded up when tracing a 2D image
by eliminating most database accesses.
------
From Valdes August 6, 1985:

1.  A bug in the absorption feature centering was fixed.
2.  Numerous cosmetic changes in the graphics are being made.  These will
be documented later.
------
From Valdes August 1, 1985:

1.  The icfit package has been modified to allow resetting the x and
y fitting points with keys 'x' and 'y'.  This is useful in identify
to reset the user coordinates directly in the fitting package.

2.  The :features command in identify now takes an (optional) file name
directing the feature information to the specified file.  Without a
file the terminal is cleared and the information written to the terminal
with a pause at the end.  With a file name the information is appended to
the specified file.

3.  A couple of small bugs in the handling of INDEF user coordinates in
identify have been fixed.

4.  The default pixel range in the icfit package when called from identify
is now the full image range rather than the range of points to be fit.

5.  The image section in identify is now used with :image just as it is
used for images given as arguments to the task.  Explicit image sections
must be given, however, in database :read and :write because the optional
names to these commands need not be image names.
------
From Valdes July 30, 1985:

1.  The tasks lsmap, lstrans, and reidentify have been changed so that
the user may specify a list of log files instead of just one logfile.
Now it is possible to have log output be written to the terminal
as well as a disk file.  This is now the default.
------
From Valdes July 27, 1985:

1.  The default user coordinate when marking a feature in identify
is the pixel coordinate if there is no coordinate function.

2.  When entering a user coordinate in identify after a (m)ark or
(u)ser key the coordinate typed by the user is matched against the
line list and the line list value substituted if a match is found.
Thus, for wavelengths the user only needs to enter the wavelength to
the nearest Angstrom and the decimal part will be found from the 
coordinate list.

3.  Response and illumination have been modified to work along either
image axis.  A new parameter "axis" has been added to select the
axis.  For response the axis should be along the dispersion (default
is along the columns) and in illumination the axis is that slit position
axis (the default is along the lines).  These changes in conjunction
with the new flat1d, fit1d, and background make the orientation of the
longslit images arbitrary!

4.  The values in the default parameter files for response, illumination,
identify, reidentify, lsmap, and lstrans have been changed.  This will
cause user parameter files to be out of date.  Sorry about that.
------
From Valdes July 26, 1985:

1.  Background has been modified to use new fit1d task.  It now does
column backgrounds without transposes and allows image sections.
------
From Valdes July 23, 1985:

1.  Task lsrevisions has been renamed to revisions.  The intent is that
each package will have a revisions task.  Note that this means there may
be multiple tasks named revisions loaded at one time.  Typing revisions
alone will give the revisions for the current package.  To get the system
revisions type system.revisions.

2.  Background now does both line and column backgrounds.
______
July 18, 1985:

1.  Help page for extract is available.
2.  Help page for lsrevisions is available.
______
July 17, 1985:

1.  Extract has been modified to allow interactively setting the
extraction limits for each trace.  If this is not needed then answer
NO to the query.  Any changes made in lower and upper remain
in effect to subsequent traces.  The lower and upper limits are written
to the database.  Older database tracings are still useable as before.
______
July 16, 1985:

1. A new task, lsrevisions, has been added to record revisions to the
beta test version of the package.

2. A help page for identify is now available!

3. A default one dimensional image section is available in the tasks
identify, reidentify, and extract.  This allows use of two dimensional
images (without an image section) to be used without bothering with
the image section.  It is also a little more general than regular image
sections in that a special format in terms of lines or columns can be given.
The default section is the "middle line".

4. Extract has been changed to allow:

	a. Recording the traced curves.
	b. Using the traced curves from one image to extract from another image.
    
This is done by having three query parameters giving the name of the
image to be traced or which was previously traced, a list of input
images from which to extract, and a list of output rootnames
one for each input image.
