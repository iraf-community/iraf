NAME
apmask -- Make pixel mask from apertures definitions
.ih
USAGE
apfind input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images with aperture definitions.
.le
.ls output
List of output mask names.  As a convention the extension ".pl" (pixel
list) should be used.
.le
.ls apertures = ""
Apertures to recenter, resize, trace, and create a mask.  This only applies
to apertures read from the input or reference database.  Any new
apertures defined with the automatic finding algorithm or interactively
are always selected.  The syntax is a list comma separated ranges
where a range can be a single aperture number, a hyphen separated
range of aperture numbers, or a range with a step specified by "x<step>";
for example, "1,3-5,9-12x2".
.le
.ls references = ""
List of reference images to be used to define apertures for the input
images.  When a reference image is given it supersedes apertures
previously defined for the input image. The list may be null, "", or
any number of images less than or equal to the list of input images.
There are three special words which may be used in place of an image
name.  The word "last" refers to the last set of apertures written to
the database.  The word "OLD" requires that an entry exist
and the word "NEW" requires that the entry not exist for each input image.
.le

.ls interactive = no
Run this task interactively?  If the task is not run interactively then
all user queries are suppressed and interactive aperture editing is
disabled.
.le
.ls find = yes
Find the spectra and define apertures automatically?  In order for
spectra to be found automatically there must be no apertures for the
input image or reference image defined in the database and the
parameter \fInfind\fR must be greater than zero.
.le
.ls recenter = no
Recenter the apertures?
.le
.ls resize = no
Resize the apertures?
.le
.ls edit = yes
Edit the apertures?  The \fIinteractive\fR parameter must also be yes.
.le
.ls trace = yes
Trace apertures?
.le
.ls fittrace = yes
Fit the traced points interactively?  The \fIinteractive\fR parameter
must also be yes.
.le
.ls mask = yes
Create mask images?
.le

.ls line = INDEF
The dispersion line (line or column perpendicular to the dispersion axis) to
be used in finding, recentering, resizing, editing, and starting to
trace spectra.  A value of INDEF selects the middle of the image.
.le
.ls nsum = 1
Number of dispersion lines to be summed or medianed.  The lines are taken
around the specified dispersion line.  A positive value takes the
sum and a negative value selects a median.
.le
.ls buffer = 0.
Buffer to add to aperture limits.  One use for this is to increase
the width of the apertures when a mask is used to fit data between
the apertures.
.le
.ih
ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
I/O parameters and the default dispersion axis are taken from the
package parameters, the default aperture parameters from
\fBapdefault\fR, automatic aperture finding parameters from
\fBapfind\fR, recentering parameters from \fBaprecenter\fR, resizing
parameters from \fBapresize\fR, parameters used for centering and
editing the apertures from \fBapedit\fR, and tracing parameters from
\fBaptrace\fR.

DESCRIPTION
Pixel list masks are created from the aperture definitions in the input
images.  Pixel list masks are a compact way to define arbitrary
regions of an image.  The masks may be used directly as an image with values
of 1 (in an aperture) and 0 (outside an aperture).  Alternatively,
some tasks may use a mask to define regions to be operated upon.
When this task was written there were no such tasks though eventually
some tasks will be converted to use this general format.  The intent
of making an aperture mask is to someday allow using it with the task
\fBimsurfit\fR to fit a background or scattered light surface.
(See \fBapscatter\fR for an alternative method).
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. To replace all data outside the apertures by zero:

.nf
	cl> apmask image image.pl nfind=10
	cl> imarith image * image.pl image1
.fi
.ih
REVISIONS
.ls APMASK V2.11
The "apertures" parameter can be used to select apertures for resizing,
recentering, tracing, and extraction.  This parameter name was previously
used for selecting apertures in the recentering algorithm.  The new
parameter name for this is now "aprecenter".
