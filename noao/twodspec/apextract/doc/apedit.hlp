NAME
apedit -- Edit apertures
.ih
USAGE
apedit input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images for which apertures are to be edited.
.le
.ls apertures = ""
Apertures to recenter, resize, trace, and extract.  This only applies
to apertures read from the input or reference database.  Any new
apertures defined with the automatic finding algorithm or interactively
are always selected.  The syntax is a list comma separated ranges
where a range can be a single aperture number, a hyphen separated
range of aperture numbers, or a range with a step specified by "x<step>";
for example, "1,3-5,9-12x2".
.le
.ls references = ""
List of reference images to be used to define apertures for the input
images.  When a reference image is given it supersedes apertures
previously defined for the input image. The list may be null, "", or
any number of images less than or equal to the list of input images.
If the reference image list is shorter than the input image list the
last reference image is used for the remaining input images.
There are three special words which may be used in place of an image
name.  The word "last" refers to the last set of apertures written to
the database.  The word "OLD" requires that an entry exist
and the word "NEW" requires that the entry not exist for each input image.
.le

.ls interactive = no
Run this task interactively?  If the task is not run interactively then
all user queries are suppressed and interactive aperture editing is
disabled.
.le
.ls find = no
Find the spectra and define apertures automatically?  In order for
spectra to be found automatically there must be no apertures for the
input image or reference image defined in the database.
.le
.ls recenter = no
Recenter the apertures?
.le
.ls resize = no
Resize the apertures?
.le
.ls edit = yes
Edit the apertures?  The \fIinteractive\fR parameter must also be yes.
.le

.ls line = INDEF
The dispersion line (line or column perpendicular to the dispersion axis) to
be graphed.  A value of INDEF uses the middle of the image.
.le
.ls nsum = 10
Number of dispersion lines to be summed or medianed.  The lines are taken
around the specified dispersion line.  A positive nsum selects a sum of
lines and a negative selects a median of lines.
.le
.ls width = 5.
Width of spectrum profiles.  This parameter is used for the profile
centering algorithm in this and other tasks.
.le
.ls radius = 5.
The profile centering error radius for the centering algorithm.
.le
.ls threshold = 0.
Centering threshold for the centering algorithm.  The range of pixel intensities
near the initial centering position must exceed this threshold.
.le
.ih
ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
I/O parameters and the default dispersion axis are taken from the
package parameters, the default aperture parameters are taken from the
task \fBapdefault\fR.  Parameters for the various functions of finding,
recentering, and resizing are taken from the parameters for the
appropriate task.

When this operation is performed from the task \fBapall\fR all parameters
except the package parameters are included in that task.

DESCRIPTION
For each image in the input image list, apertures are defined and edited
interactively.  The aperture editor is invoked when the parameters
\fIinteractive\fR and \fIedit\fR are both yes.  When this is the case
the task will query whether to edit each image.  The responses are
"yes", "no", "YES", and "NO", where the upper case responses suppress
queries for all following images.

When the aperture editor is entered a graph of the image lines or
columns specified by the parameters \fIline\fR and \fInsum\fR is
drawn.  In the \fBapextract\fR package a dispersion line is either a
line or column in the image at one point along the dispersion axis.
The dispersion axis may be defined in the image header under the
keyword DISPAXIS or by the package parameter \fIdispaxis\fR.  The
parameter \fBnsum\fR determines how many dispersion lines surrounding
the specified dispersion line are summed or medianed.  This improves the
signal in the profiles of weaker spectra.  Once the graph is drawn an
interactive cursor loop is entered.  The set of cursor keys and colon
commands is given above and may be printed when the task is running using
the '?' key.  The CURSOR MODE keys and graph formatting options are also
available (see \fBcursor\fR and \fBgtools\fR).

A status line, usually at the bottom of the graphics terminal,
indicates the current aperture and shows the ALL flag, 'a' key, if set.  The
concept of the current aperture is used by several of the aperture
editing commands.  Other commands operate on the aperture whose center
is nearest the cursor.  It is important to know which commands operate
on the current aperture and which operate on the nearest aperture to
the cursor.

The cursor keys and colon commands are used to define new apertures,
delete existing apertures, modify the aperture number, beam number,
title, center, and limits, set background fitting parameters, trace the
positions of the spectra in the apertures, and extract aperture
spectra.  When creating new apertures default parameters are supplied
in two ways; if no apertures are defined then the default parameters
are taken from the task \fBapdefault\fR while if there is a current
aperture then a copy of its parameters are made.

The keys for creating a new aperture are 'm' and 'n' and 'f'.  The key
'm' marks a new aperture and centers the aperture on the profile
nearest the cursor.  The centering algorithm is described under the
help topic \fBcenter1d\fR and the parameters controlling the centering are
\fIwidth\fR, \fIradius\fR, and \fIthreshold\fR.  The key 'n' defines a
new aperture at the position of the cursor without centering.  This is
used if there is no spectrum profile such as when defining sky apertures
or when defining apertures in extended profiles.  The 'f' key finds new
apertures using the algorithm described in the task \fBapfind\fR.  The
number of apertures found in this way is limited by the parameter
\fBnfind\fR and the number includes any previously defined
apertures.  The new aperture number, beam number, and title are assigned using
the aperture assignment algorithm described in \fBapfind\fR.

The aperture number for the aperture \fInearest\fR the cursor is changed
with the 'j' key and the beam number is changed with the 'k' key.  The
user is prompted for a new aperture number or beam number.  The
aperture title may be set or changed with the :title colon command.

The 'o' key may be used to reorder or correct the aperture
identifications and beam numbers.  This is useful if the aperture
numbers become disordered due to deletions and additions or if the
first spectrum is missing when using the automatic identification
algorithm.  An aperture number is requested for the aperture pointed to
by the cursor.  The remaining apertures are reordered relative to this
aperture number.  There is a aperture number, beam number, and title
assignment algorithm which uses information about the maximum
separation between consecutive apertures, the direction of increasing
aperture numbers, and an optional aperture identification table.  See
\fBapfind\fR for a description of the algorithm.

After defining a new aperture it becomes the current aperture.  The
current aperture is indicated on the status line and the '.', '+', and
'-' keys are used to select a new current aperture.

Apertures are deleted with 'd' key.  The aperture \fInearest\fR the
cursor is deleted.

The aperture center may be changed with the 'c', 's', and 'g' keys and the
":center value" colon command.  The 'c' key applies the centering algorithm
to the aperture \fInearest\fR the colon.  The 's' key shifts the center
of the \fIcurrent\fR aperture to the position of the cursor.  The 'g'
applies the \fBaprecenter\fR algorithm.  The :center command sets the
center of the \fIcurrent\fR aperture to the value specified.  Except
for the last option these commands may be applied to all apertures
if the ALL flag is set.

The aperture limits are defined relative to the aperture center.  The
limits may be changed with the 'l', 'u', 'y', and 'z' keys and with the
":lower value" and ":upper value" commands.  The 'l' and 'u' keys set
the lower and upper limits of the \fIcurrent\fR aperture at the position
of the cursor.  The colon commands allow setting the limits explicitly.
The 'y' key defines both limits for the \fInearest\fR aperture as
points at which the y cursor position intercepts the data profile.
This requires that the aperture include a spectrum profile and that
the y cursor value lie below the peak of the profile.  The 'z'
key applies the \fBapresize\fR algorithm.  Except for the colon
commands these commands may be applied to all apertures if the ALL
flag is set.

The key 'b' modifies the background fitting parameters for the aperture
\fInearest\fR the cursor.  The default background parameters are
specified by the task \fBapdefault\fR.  Note that even though
background parameters are defined, background subtraction is not
performed during extraction unless specified.
When the 'b' key is used the \fBicfit\fR graphical interface is entered
showing the background regions and function fit for the current image
line.  Note that the background regions are specified relative to
the aperture center and follows changes in the aperture position.

The two types of
extraction which may be specified are to average all points within
a set of background regions or fit a function to the points in
the background regions.  In the first case only the background sample
parameter is used.  In the latter case the other parameters are
also used in conjunction with the \fBicfit\fR function fitting commands.
See \fBapbackground\fR for more on the background parameters.

Each aperture may have different background
fitting parameters but newly defined apertures inherit the background
fitting parameters of the last current aperture.  This will usually be
satisfactory since the background regions are defined relative to the
aperture center rather than in absolute coordinates.  If the ALL flag
is set then all apertures will be given the same background
parameters.

The algorithms used in the tasks \fBapfind, aprecenter, apresize, aptrace\fR,
and \fBapsum\fR are available from the editor with the keys 'f', 'g', 'z',
't', and 'e'
respectively.  Excluding finding, if the ALL flag is not set then the
nearest aperture
to the cursor is used.  This allows selective recentering, resizing,
tracing and extracting.
If the ALL flag is set then all apertures are traced or extracted.
When extracting the output, rootname and profile name are queried.

Some general purpose keys window the graph 'w' using the \fBgtools\fR
commands, redraw the graph 'r', and quit 'q'.

The final cursor key is the 'a' key.  The cursor keys which modify the
apertures were defined as operating on either the aperture nearest the
cursor or the current aperture.  The 'a' key allows these keys to
affect all the apertures simultaneously.  The 'a' key sets a flag which
is shown on the status line when it is set.  When set, the operation on
one aperture is duplicated on the remaining apertures.  The operations
which apply to all apertures are set background 'b', center 'c', delete
'd', extract 'e', recenter 'g', set lower limit 'l', shift 's', trace
't', set upper limit 'u', set limits at the y cursor 'y', and resize
'z'.  The 'b', 'l', 's', and 'u' keys first set the background,
aperture limits, or shift for the appropriate aperture and then are
applied to the other apertures relative to their centers.

All the parameters used in any of the operations may be examined or
changed through colon commands.  The :parameters command lists all
parameter values and :show lists the apertures.  The :read and :write
are used to force an update or save the current apertures and to read
apertures for the current image or from some other image.  The commands
all have optional arguments.  For the commands which show information
the argument specifies a file to which the information is to be
written.  The default is the standard output.  The database read and
write and the change image commands take an image name.  If an image
name is not given for the read and write commands the
current image name is used.  The change image command default is to
print the current image name.  The remaining commands take a value.  If
a value is not given then the current value is printed.

The aperture editor may be selected from nearly every task using the
\fBedit\fR parameter.

EXAMPLES
The aperture editor is a very flexible and interactive tool
for which it is impossible illustrate all likely uses.  The following
give some simple examples.

1.  To define and edit apertures for image "n1.001":

.nf
	cl> apedit n1.001
.fi

2.  To define apertures for one image and then apply them to several other
images:

.nf
	cl> apedit n1.* ref=n1.001
	Edit apertures for n1.001? (yes)
	Edit apertures for n1.002? (yes) NO
.fi

Answer "yes" to the first query for editing n1.001.  To
the next query (for n1.002) respond with "NO".  The remaining
images then will not be edited interactively.  Note that after
defining the apertures for n1.001 they are recorded in the database
and subsequent images will be able to use them as reference apertures.

3.  Using the ":image name" and ":read image" colon commands and the
'f', 'g', 'z', 't' and 'e' keys the user can perform all the functions
available in the package without ever leaving the editor.  The 'a' key
to set the ALL flag is very useful when dealing with many spectra in a
single image.

REVISIONS
.ls APEDIT V2.11
The "apertures" parameter can be used to select apertures for resizing,
recentering, tracing, and extraction.  This parameter name was previously
used for selecting apertures in the recentering algorithm.  The new
parameter name for this is now "aprecenter".

The aperture ID table information may now be contained in the
image header under the keywords SLFIBnnn.
