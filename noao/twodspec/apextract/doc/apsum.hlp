apsum -- Extract one dimensional sums across the apertures
.ih
USAGE
apsum input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images containing apertures to be extracted.
.le
.ls output = ""
List of output rootnames for the extracted spectra.  If the null
string is given or the end of the output list is reached before the end
of the input list then the input image name is used as the output rootname.
This will not conflict with the input image since an aperture number
extension is added for onedspec format, the extension ".ms" for multispec
format, or the extension ".ec" for echelle format.
.le
.ls apertures = ""
Apertures to recenter, resize, trace, and extract.  This only applies
to apertures read from the input or reference database.  Any new
apertures defined with the automatic finding algorithm or interactively
are always selected.  The syntax is a list comma separated ranges
where a range can be a single aperture number, a hyphen separated
range of aperture numbers, or a range with a step specified by "x<step>";
for example, "1,3-5,9-12x2".
.le
.ls format = "multispec" (onedspec|multispec|echelle|strip)
Format for output extracted spectra.  "Onedspec" format extracts each
aperture to a separate image while "multispec" and "echelle" extract
multiple apertures for the same image to a single output image.
The "multispec" and "echelle" format selections differ only in the
extension added.  The "strip" format produces a separate 2D image in
which each column or line along the dispersion axis is shifted to
exactly align the aperture based on the trace information.
.le
.ls references = ""
List of reference images to be used to define apertures for the input
images.  When a reference image is given it supersedes apertures
previously defined for the input image. The list may be null, "", or
any number of images less than or equal to the list of input images.
There are three special words which may be used in place of an image
name.  The word "last" refers to the last set of apertures written to
the database.  The word "OLD" requires that an entry exist
and the word "NEW" requires that the entry not exist for each input image.
.le
.ls profiles = ""
List of profile images for variance weighting or cleanning.   If variance
weighting or cleanning a profile of each aperture is computed from the
input image unless a profile image is specified, in which case the
profile is computed from the profile image.  The profile image must
have the same dimensions and dispersion and it is assumed that the
spectra have the same position and profile shape as in the object
spectra.  Use of a profile image is generally not required even for
faint input spectra but the option is available for those who wish
to use it.
.le

.ls interactive = yes
Run this task interactively?  If the task is not run interactively then
all user queries are suppressed and interactive aperture editing, trace
fitting, and extraction review are disabled.
.le
.ls find = yes
Find the spectra and define apertures automatically?  In order for
spectra to be found automatically there must be no apertures for the
input image or reference image defined in the database.
.le
.ls recenter = no
Recenter the apertures?
.le
.ls resize = no
Resize the apertures?
.le
.ls edit = yes
Edit the apertures?  The \fIinteractive\fR parameter must also be yes.
.le
.ls trace = yes
Trace the apertures?
.le
.ls fittrace = yes
Interactively fit the traced positions by a function?  The \fIinteractive\fR
parameter must also be yes.
.le
.ls extract = yes
Extract the one dimensional aperture sums?
.le
.ls extras = no
Extract the raw spectrum (if variance weighting is used), the sky spectrum
(if background subtraction is used), and variance spectrum (if variance
weighting is used)?  This information is extracted to the third dimension
of the output image.
.le
.ls review = yes
Review the extracted spectra?  The \fIinteractive\fR parameter must also be
yes.
.le

.ls line = INDEF, nsum = 10
The dispersion line (line or column perpendicular to the dispersion
axis) and number of adjacent lines (half before and half after unless
at the end of the image) used in finding, recentering, resizing,
and editing operations.  For tracing this is the starting line and
the same number of lines are summed at each tracing point.  A line of
INDEF selects the middle of the image along the dispersion axis.
A positive nsum takes a sum while a negative value selects a median
except that tracing always uses a sum.
.le

.ls background = "none" (none|average|median|minimum|fit)
Type of background subtraction.  The choices are "none" for no background
subtraction, "average" to average the background within the background
regions, "median" to use the median in the background regions, "minimum" to
use the minimum in the background regions, or "fit" to fit across the
dispersion using the background within the background regions.  Note that
the "average" option does not do any medianing or bad pixel checking,
something which is recommended.  The fitting option is slower than the
other options and requires additional fitting parameter.
.le
.ls weights = "none"
Type of extraction weighting.  Note that if the \fIclean\fR parameter is
set then the weights used are "variance" regardless of the weights
specified by this parameter.  The choices are:
.ls "none"
The pixels are summed without weights except for partial pixels at the
ends.
.le
.ls "variance"
The extraction is weighted by the variance based on the data values
and a poisson/ccd model using the \fIgain\fR and \fIreadnoise\fR
parameters.
.le
.le
.ls pfit = "fit1d" (fit1d|fit2d)
Profile fitting algorithm to use with variance weighting or cleaning.
When determining a profile the two dimensional spectrum is divided by
an estimate of the one dimensional spectrum to form a normalized two
dimensional spectrum profile.  This profile is then smoothed by fitting
one dimensional functions, "fit1d", along the lines or columns most closely
corresponding to the dispersion axis or a special two dimensional
function, "fit2d", described by Marsh (see \fBapprofile\fR).
.le
.ls clean = no
Detect and replace deviant pixels?
.le
.ls skybox = 1
Box car smoothing length for sky background when using background
subtraction.  Since the background noise is often the limiting factor
for good extraction one may box car smooth the sky to improve the
statistics in smooth background regions at the expense of distorting
the subtraction near spectral features.  This is most appropriate when
the sky regions are limited due to a small slit length.
.le
.ls saturation = INDEF
Saturation or nonlinearity level in data units.  During variance weighted
extractions wavelength points having any pixels above this value are
excluded from the profile determination and the sigma spectrum extraction
output, if selected by the \fIextras\fR parameter, flags wavelengths with
saturated pixels with a negative sigma.
.le
.ls readnoise = 0.
Read out noise in photons.  This parameter defines the minimum noise
sigma.  It is defined in terms of photons (or electrons) and scales
to the data values through the gain parameter.  A image header keyword
(case insensitive) may be specified to get the value from the image.
.le
.ls gain = 1
Detector gain or conversion factor between photons/electrons and
data values.  It is specified as the number of photons per data value.
A image header keyword (case insensitive) may be specified to get the value
from the image.
.le
.ls lsigma = 4., usigma = 4.
Lower and upper rejection thresholds, given as a number of times the
estimated sigma of a pixel, for cleaning.
.le
.ls nsubaps = 1
During extraction it is possible to equally divide the apertures into
this number of subapertures.  For multispec format all subapertures will
be in the same file with aperture numbers of 1000*(subap-1)+ap where
subap is the subaperture (1 to nsubaps) and ap is the main aperture
number.  For echelle format there will be a separate echelle format
image containing the same subaperture from each order.  The name
will have the subaperture number appended.  For onedspec format
each subaperture will be in a separate file with extensions and
aperture numbers as in the multispec format.
.le

DESCRIPTION
For each image in the input image list, the two dimensional spectra are
extracted to one dimensional spectra by summing the pixels across the
dispersion axis at each wavelength along the dispersion axis within a
set of defined apertures.  The extraction apertures consist of an
aperture number, a beam number, a title, a center, limits relative to
the center, a curve describing shifts of the aperture center across the
dispersion axis as a function of the wavelength, and parameters for
background fitting and subtraction.  See \fBapextract\fR for a more
detailed discussion of the aperture structures.

The extracted spectra are recorded in one, two, or three dimensional
images depending on the \fIformat\fR and \fIextras\fR parameters.  The
output image rootnames are specified by the \fIoutput\fR list. If the
list is empty or shorter than the input list the missing names are
taken to be the same as the input image names.  Because the rootnames
have extensions added it is common to default to the input names in
order to preserve a naming relation between the input two dimensional
spectra and the extracted spectra.

When the parameter \fIextras\fR=no only the extracted spectra are
output.  If the format parameter \fIformat\fR="onedspec" the output
aperture extractions are one dimensional images with names formed from
the output rootname and a numeric extension given by the aperture
number; i.e. root.0001 for aperture 1.  Note that there will be as many
output images as there are apertures for each input image, all with the
same output rootname but with different aperture extensions.  The
aperture beam number associated with each aperture is recorded in the
output image under the keyword BEAM-NUM.  The output image name format
and the BEAM-NUM entry in the image are chosen to be compatible with
the \fBonedspec\fR package.

If the format parameter is "echelle" or "multispec" the output aperture
extractions are put into a two dimensional image with a name formed from
the output rootname and the extension ".ech" or ".ms".  Each line in
the output image corresponds to one aperture.  Thus in this format
there is one output image for each input image.  These are the preferred
output formats for reasons of compactness and ease of handling.  These
formats are compatible with the \fBonedspec\fR, \fBechelle\fR, and
\fBmsred\fR packages.  The relation between the line and the aperture
numbers is given by the header parameter APNUMn where n is the line and
the value is the aperture number and other numeric information.

If the \fIextras\fR parameter is set to yes then the above formats
become three dimensional.  Each plane in the third dimension contains
associated information for the spectra in the first plane.  If variance
weighted extractions are done the unweighted spectra are recorded.  If
background subtraction is done the background spectra are recorded.  If
variance weighted extractions are done the sigma spectrum (the
estimated sigma of each spectrum pixel based on the individual
variances of the pixels summed) is recorded.  The order of the
additional information is as given above.  For example, an unweighted
extraction with background subtraction will have one additional plane
containing the sky spectra while a variance weighted extraction with
background subtractions will have the variance weighted spectra, the
unweighted spectra, the background spectra, and the sigma spectra in
consecutive planes.

Aperture definitions may be inherited from those of other images by
specifying a reference image with the \fBreferences\fR parameter.
Images in the reference list are matched with those in the
input list in order.  If the reference image list is shorter than the
number of input images, the last reference image is used for all
remaining input images.  Thus, a single reference image may be given
for all the input images or different reference images may be given for
each input image.  The special reference name "last" may be used to
select the last set apertures used in any of the \fBapextract\fR tasks.

If an aperture reference image is not specified or no apertures are
found for the specified reference image, previously defined apertures
for the input image are sought in the aperture database.  Note that
reference apertures supersede apertures for the input image.  If no
apertures are defined they may be created automatically, the \fIfind\fR
option, or interactively in the aperture editor, if the
\fIinteractive\fR and \fIedit\fR options are set.

The functions performed by the task are selected by a set of flag
parameters.  The functions are an automatic spectrum finding and
aperture defining algorithm (see \fBapfind\fR) which is ignored if
apertures are already defined, automatic recentering and resizing
algorithms (see \fBaprecenter\fR and \fBapresize\fR), an interactive
aperture editing function (see \fBapedit\fR), a spectrum position tracing
and trace function fit (see \fBaptrace\fR), and the main function of
this task, one dimensional spectrum extraction.

Each function selection will produce a query for each input spectrum if
the \fIinteractive\fR parameter is set.  The queries are answered by
"yes", "no", "YES", or "NO", where the upper case responses suppress
the query for following images.  There are other queries associated
with tracing and extracted spectrum review which first ask whether the
operation is to be done interactively and, if yes, lead to queries for
each aperture.  The cursor keys available during spectrum review are
minimal, only the CURSOR MODE keys for expanding and adjusting the
graph are available and the quit key 'q'.  If the \fIinteractive\fR
parameter is not set then aperture editing, interactive trace fitting,
and spectrum review are ignored.

Background sky subtraction is done during the extraction based on
background regions and parameters defined by the default parameters or
changed during the interactive setting of the apertures.  The background
subtraction options are to do no background subtraction, subtract the
average, median, or minimum of the pixels in the background regions, or to
fit a function and subtract the function from under the extracted object
pixels.  The background regions are specified in pixels from
the aperture center and follow changes in center of the spectrum along the
dispersion.  The syntax is colon separated ranges with multiple ranges
separated by a comma or space.  The background fitting uses the \fBicfit\fR
routines which include medians, iterative rejection of deviant points, and
a choice of function types and orders.  Note that it is important to use a
method which rejects cosmic rays such as using either medians over all the
background regions (\fIbackground\fR = "median") or median samples during
fitting (\fIb_naverage\fR < -1).  The background subtraction algorithm and
options are described in greater detail in \fBapsum\fR and
\fBapbackground\fR.

Since the background noise is often the limiting factor for good
extraction one may box car smooth the sky to improve the statistics in
smooth background regions at the expense of distorting the subtraction
near spectra features.  This is most appropriate when the sky region is
limited due to small slit length.  The smoothing length is specified by
the parameter \fIskybox\fR.

For a more extended discussion about the background determination see
\fBapbackground\fR.

The aperture extractions consists of summing all the background
subtracted pixel values at a given wavelength within the aperture
limits.  The aperture limits form a fixed width aperture but the center
varies smoothly to follow changes in the position of the spectrum
across the dispersion axis.  At the ends of the aperture partial pixels
are used.

The pixels in the sum may be weighted as specified by the \fIweights\fR
parameter.  If the weights parameter is "none" and the \fIclean\fR
parameter is no then the simple sum of the pixels (with fractional
endpoints) is extracted.  If the weights parameter is "variance" or if
the \fBclean\fR parameter is yes the pixels are weighted by their
estimated variance derived from a noise model based on the \fIgain\fR
and \fIreadnoise\fR parameters and a smooth profile function.  Normally
the profile function is determined from the data being extracted.
However, one may substitute a "profile" image as specified by the
\fIprofiles\fR parameter for computing the profile.  This requires that
the profile image have spectra of identical position and profile as
the image being extracted.  For example, this would likely be the case
with fiber spectra and an off-telescope spectrograph and a strong flat
field or object spectrum could be used for weak spectra.  Note that
experience has shown that even for very weak spectra there is little
improvement with using a separate profile image but the user is free
to experiment.

When the \fIclean\fR parameter is set pixels deviating by more than a
specified number of sigma from the profile function are excluded from the
variance weighted sum.  Note that the \fIclean\fR parameter always selects
variance weights.  For a more complete discussion of the extraction sums,
variance weighting, cleaning, the noise model, and profile function
determination see \fBapvariance\fR and \fBapprofiles\fR.

EXAMPLES
1.  To simply extract the spectra from a multislit observation:

.nf
	cl> apsum multislit1
.fi

The positions of the slits are defined using either automatic finding
or with the aperture editor.  The positions of the slits are traced if
necessary and then the apertures are extracted to the image
"multslit1.ms".  The steps of defining the slit positions and tracing
can be done as part of this command or previously using the other tasks
in the \fBapextract\fR package.
.ih
REVISIONS
.ls APSUM V2.11
The "apertures" parameter can be used to select apertures for resizing,
recentering, tracing, and extraction.  This parameter name was previously
used for selecting apertures in the recentering algorithm.  The new
parameter name for this is now "aprecenter".

The "nsubaps" parameter now allows onedspec and echelle output formats.
The echelle format is appropriate for treating each subaperture as
a full echelle extraction.

The dispersion axis parameter was moved to purely a package parameter.

As a final step when computing a weighted/cleaned spectrum the total
fluxes from the weighted spectrum and the simple unweighted spectrum
(excluding any deviant and saturated pixels) are computed and a
"bias" factor of the ratio of the two fluxes is multiplied into
the weighted spectrum and the sigma estimate.  This makes the total
fluxes the same.  In this version the bias factor is recorded in the logfile
if one is kept.  Also a check is made for unusual bias factors.
If the two fluxes disagree by more than a factor of two a warning
is given on the standard output and the logfile with the individual
total fluxes as well as the bias factor.  If the bias factor is
negative a warning is also given and no bias factor is applied.
In the previous version a negative (inverted) spectrum would result.
