NAME
aprecenter -- Recenter apertures automatically
.ih
USAGE
aprecenter input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images in which apertures are to be recentered.
.le
.ls apertures = ""
Apertures to recenter, resize, trace, and extract.  This only applies
to apertures read from the input or reference database.  Any new
apertures defined with the automatic finding algorithm or interactively
are always selected.  The syntax is a list comma separated ranges
where a range can be a single aperture number, a hyphen separated
range of aperture numbers, or a range with a step specified by "x<step>";
for example, "1,3-5,9-12x2".
.le
.ls references = ""
List of reference images to be used to define apertures for the input
images.  When a reference image is given it supersedes apertures
previously defined for the input image. The list may be null, "", or
any number of images less than or equal to the list of input images.
There are three special words which may be used in place of an image
name.  The word "last" refers to the last set of apertures written to
the database.  The word "OLD" requires that an entry exist
and the word "NEW" requires that the entry not exist for each input image.
.le
.ls interactive = no
Run this task interactively?  If the task is not run interactively then
all user queries are suppressed and interactive aperture editing is
disabled.
.le
.ls find = yes
Find the spectra and define apertures automatically?  In order for
spectra to be found automatically there must be no apertures for the
input image or reference image defined in the database.
.le
.ls recenter = yes
Recenter the apertures?
.le
.ls resize = no
Resize the apertures?
.le
.ls edit = yes
Edit the apertures?  The \fIinteractive\fR parameter must also be yes.
.le

.ls line = INDEF
The dispersion line (line or column perpendicular to the dispersion axis) to
be used in recentering the spectra.  A value of INDEF selects the middle of the
image.
.le
.ls nsum = 1
Number of dispersion lines to be summed or medianed.  The lines are taken
around the specified dispersion line.  A positive value takes a sum
and a negative values selects a median.
.le
.ls aprecenter = ""
List of apertures to be used in shift calculation.
.le
.ls npeaks = INDEF
Select the specified number of apertures with the highest peak values
to be recentered.  If the number is INDEF all apertures will be selected.
If the value is less than 1 then the value is interpreted as a fraction
of total number of apertures.
.le
.ls shift = yes
Use the median shift from recentering the selected apertures to apply to
all apertures.  The recentering is then a constant shift for all apertures.
The median is the average of the two central values for an even number
of apertures.
.le
.ih
ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
I/O parameters and the default dispersion axis are taken from the
package parameters, the default aperture parameters are taken from the
task \fBapdefault\fR, automatic aperture finding parameters are taken
from \fBapfind\fR, and parameters used for centering and editing the
apertures are taken from \fBapedit\fR.

When this operation is performed from the task \fBapall\fR all parameters
except the package parameters are included in that task.
.ih
DESCRIPTION
For each image in the input image list, the aperture center positions
are redefined by centering at the specified dispersion line using the
\fBcenter1d\fR algorithm with centering parameters from \fBapedit\fR.
Normally this is done when inheriting apertures from an aperture
reference image.  The recentering does not change the "trace" of the
aperture but simple adds a shift across the dispersion axis.

There are a several recentering options.  Each selected aperture may be
recentered independently.  However, if some or all of the spectra are
relatively weak this may actually be worse than using the reference
apertures defined by strong spectra or flat fields in the case of
fibers or aperture masks.  One may select a subset of apertures to be
used in calculating shift.  This is done with a the \fIaprecenter\fR
list of aperture numbers (see
\fBranges\fR for the syntax) and/or by selecting a specific number or
fraction of the apertures with the strongest peak values.  The list
selection is done first and the strongest remaining apertures are used
to satisfy the \fBnpeaks\fR value.  Though some or all of the apertures
may be recentered independently the most common case of recentering
reference apertures is to account for detector shifts.  In this case
one expects that any shift should be common to all apertures.  The
\fIshift\fR parameter allows using the new centers for all selected
apertures to compute a median shift to be added to ALL apertures.  Using
a median shift for all apertures is the default.

The \fIfind\fR parameter allows automatically finding apertures if none
are defined for the image or by a reference image.  Since the purpose
of this task is to recenter reference apertures it is usually the case
that reference images are used and apertures are not defined by this
task.  One case in which the apertures from the image itself might be
recentered is if one wants to use a different dispersion line.  The
\fIresize\fR parameter may be used to adjust the widths in a variety
of ways based on the spectra profiles specific to each image.  The
aperture positions and any other parameters may also be edited with the
aperture editing function if selected by the \fIapedit\fR parameter and
the task is run interactively.  The recentering algorithm may be run
from the aperture editor using the 'g' keystroke.

If the task is interactive the user is queried whether to perform
various steps on each image.  The queries may be answered with one of
the four values "yes", "no", "YES" and "NO", where an upper case
response suppresses all further queries to this question.

The aperture recentering algorithm may be selected from nearly every task
in the package.

REVISIONS
.ls APRECENTER V2.11
The "apertures" parameter can be used to select apertures for resizing,
recentering, tracing, and extraction.  This parameter name was previously
used for selecting apertures in the recentering algorithm.  The new
parameter name for this is now "aprecenter".
