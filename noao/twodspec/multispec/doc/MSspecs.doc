1.  Introduction

     The  multi-spectra  extraction  package  (MULTISPEC)  provides  the 
basic tools for modeling, cleaning, and extracting spectra  from  images
containing  multiple  aperture  spectra running roughly parallel.  These
tools will generally be combined  in  reduction  script  tasks  but  may
also be used directly for non-standard analysis.

     This  design  presents  the requirements and specifications for the
MULTISPEC package.  Details concerning the algorithms  are  given  in  a
separate document, Algorithms for the Multi-Spectra Extraction Package.


2.  Input Data Requirements

    The  input  data  for  the MULTISPEC package consists of image files
containing one or more aperture spectra.  The spectra  are  required  to
run   roughly  parallel  to  each  other  and  parallel  to  the  second 
digitization  axis.   The  latter  requirement  may  require  a  general 
rotation  and  interpolation  image operator.  The images are assumed to
be  corrected  to  linear  relative  intensity.   Thus,  the  steps   of 
correcting   digital   detector  images  for  dark  current,  bias,  and 
pixel-to-pixel sensitivity variations must  be  performed  before  using
the MULTISPEC tasks.

     Because  the  the MULTISPEC package is being developed concurrently
with the IRAF standard image processing tools  this  document  specifies
the   requirements  for  the  preliminary  image  processing  needed  to 
prepare digital detector images for the MULTISPEC package.


2.1  Basic Digital Detector Reduction Tasks

     The prelimary reduction of multi-spectra  images  uses  CL  scripts
based  on  general  image  operators.   Some  of  the  scripts  are  for 
specific instruments or specific reduction  applications  and  some  are
generally   useful  image  processing  tasks.   The  scripts  allow  the 
specification  of  many  images  for  which  the  operations   will   be 
repetitively applied.

     The  following  CL  scripts  are  required  to reduce multi-spectra
images from digital detectors.

debias
    The files in a list of  filenames  are  automatically  debiased  and
    trimmed.   This  routine  will  be  instrument  specific but used by
    other reduction tasks beyond MULTISPEC.

multispec_flat
    The files in a list of quartz  multi-spectra  filenames  are  added,
    the  result  is  smoothed  along  the dispersion dimension, and then
    the original image is divided by the smoothed  image  to  produce  a
    flat  field  image.   The  unsmoothed  to smoothed ratio is computed
    only  if  the  value  of  the  smoothed  pixel  is  greater  than  a 
    specified  amount.   Otherwise,  the  ratio  is  set to unity.  This
    routine is not instrument specific but is used  only  for  MULTISPEC
    reductions.

flat_divide
    The  files  in  a  list of filenames are each divided by a specified
    flat field image.  This routine is  not  instrument  or  application
    specific.

    The  required  general image processing programs needed to implement
these scripts are specified below.


(1) A routine to compute the average value from a specified area of  the
    image.  Used to determine the average bias value from a bias strip.

(2) A  routine  to  trim  a specified portion of an image.  Used to trim
    the bias strip.

(3) Routines to multiply and subtract images by  a  constant.   Used  to
    scale  images  such as dark exposures and to remove the average bias
    value as obtained by (1) above.

(4) Routines to subtract, add, and  divide  images.   Used  to  subtract
    dark  current  and  bias  exposures,  to  add  several  exposures to
    increase the signal-to-noise, and to divide by a flat  field  image.
    The  divide  routine  must  give the user the option to substitute a
    constant or ignore any divisions in which the  denominator  is  less
    than a specified value.

(5) A  routine  to  rotate  or  transpose  an  image.  Used to align the
    spectra along lines or columns.

(6) A  routine  to  apply  a  filter  to  lines  of  the   image.    For 
    multi-spectra  images  a  smooth  quartz  is  produced  by  using  a 
    running  quadratic  filter  along  each  line  of   the   dispersion 
    dimension.   The  filter  must  be  able  to  recognize  bad  pixels 
    (specified by a user defined threshold) and  remove  them  from  the
    filtering operation.

    the algorithms.

(5) It  shall  be  possible  to  specify specific lines or swaths in the
    image on which to operate.

    that  a  reasonable  solution is always obtained, though of possibly
    limited usefulness.

(2) The modeling shall provide estimates for the  uncertainties  in  the
    fitted parameters as a function of position along the spectrum.

(3) Remove  cosmic  rays  and other defective pixels by reference to the
    model.

    image.

(5) Display  numerically and graphically the data, the fitted model, and
    the residuals.


4.  Program Specifications


4.1  Basic Programs

     The basic programs of the package are general purpose  tools  which
initialize  a  MULTISPEC  data  file  and  perform  a single fundamental
operation on the data in the MULTISPEC data file.   There  is  one  data
file  associated  with  each  image.   The  data file is hidden from the
user and so the user need not be aware  of  the  data  file.   The  data
files  are  referenced  only the image filename specified in the program
parameters.  The data files contain such  information  as  a  processing
history,  the  spectra  positions  and extracted luminosities, the model
parameters (one set for each spectra for each modelled  image  line  (or
swath),  etc.   The  programs  generally are allowed to specify specific
lines, columns, and/or spectra on which to operate.   The  line,  column
and  spectra  specifications  are given as strings which contain numbers
separated by whitespace, commas,  and  the  range  indicator  "-".   The
script  tasks  of  section  4.2  will  combine  these  basic programs to
perform a general multi-spectra extraction.

ap_plate
    The information from an on-line data  file  containing  descriptions
    of  all  the aperture plates prepared at Kitt Peak is read to find a
    specified  aperture  plate.   The  drilled  aperture  positions  are 
    correlated  with  the  spectra  in  the  image  to  deduce  relative 
    wavelength offsets.  The identifications for  the  spectra  as  well
    as  other  auxiliary  information  is recorded in the data file.  If
    no  image  file  is  specified  then   only   the   aperture   plate 
    information   is   printed.    This   program   is   used   in   the  
    MULTIAP_EXTRACT program.  This  program  is  not  essential  to  the
    operation of the MULTISPEC package.

The Background
    The  are  two possibilities for dealing with the background.  In the
    first  case,  FIT_BCKGRND,  the  background  will   be   fitted   by 
    polynomials  and  the  coefficients  stored  in  the  MULTISPEC data
    file.  These coefficients are then used by  the  other  programs  to
    estimate   the  background  at  the  spectra.   The  second  option, 
    FIND_BCKGRND, generates a background  image  in  which  the  spectra
    and  other  selected  areas are set to blank pixels.  Then a general
    image interpolator is used fill in the blank pixels with  background
    estimates.   The  other  MULTISPEC  programs  will  then access this
    background frame.  The background frame image name  will  be  stored
    in the MULTISPEC data file and the image header.


    fit_bckgrnd
        Fit  a  background  in  a  MULTISPEC image by a polynomial using
        pixels not near the spectra and in  the  user  specified  swaths
        and  columns.   The buffer distance is in pixels and refers to a
        minimum distance from the center of any  spectrum  beyond  which
        the  background  pixels  are found.  Blank pixels are ignored in
        the background fit.  Deviant pixels will be rejected.

copy_params
    Create  a  MULTISPEC  data  file  for  a new image using appropriate
    MULTISPEC parameters from an old image.  The  old  image  must  have
    been  processed  to find the spectra using FIND_SPECTRA and possibly
    model fit.

find_spectra
    Initially locate the spectra in a MULTISPEC  image.   The  positions
    of  the  spectra  within the range of columns are determined for the
    starting line and then the spectra are tracked within the  range  of
    lines.   The  minimum  separation  and minimum width would generally
    be set for a particular instrument.   If  the  automatic  search  is
    not  used  then a list of cursor positions is read from the standard
    input.

model_extract
    A  previously  fitted  model  is  used  to extract the spectra total
    luminosity by apportioning the data values to spectra in  the  ratio
    indicated  by  the model.  If the clean option is specified then the
    model is used to detect pixels which deviate from  the  model  by  a
    specified  amount.   The  model  value replaces the deviant pixel in
    the extraction and, if specified, also in the image file.

model_fit
    A specified model is iteratively fitted to the data in each  of  the
    specified  lines  (or  swaths)  until  the  RMS  residual  fails  to 
    decrease.  The models  are  selected  by  a  string.   The  possible
    values are

        (null string) - initialize the model
        i - fit only the intensity scale
        ip - fit the intensity scale and the position
        ips1 - fit the intensity scale, position, and one parameter shape
        ips2 - fit the intensity scale, position, and two parameter shape
        ips3 - fit the intensity scale, position, and three parameter shape
        ips4 - fit the intensity scale, position, and four parameter shape
    These  models  will  be  combined in a script to search for the best
    fit.

    The initial shape parameters will generally be set by scripts for  a
    particular data reduction.

sigma_extract
    A previously fitted model is used to extract the spectra  luminosity
    within  a  specified  sigma  of  the peak.  Because the model is not
    necessarily a Gaussian the sigma is used to  compute  the  intensity
    ratio  of  the  cutoff to the peak assumining a Gaussian profile and
    then the data is extracted to the point the  model  intensity  falls
    below  that  cutoff.   If  the  clean  option  is specified then the
    model is used to detect pixels which deviate from  the  model  by  a
    specified  amount.   The  model  value replaces the deviant pixel in
    the extraction and, if specified, also in the image file.

strip_extract
    A strip of constant width about the spectra positions is  extracted.
    If  cleanning  is  desired  a  smoothed  estimate  of the profile is
    obtained by averaging a  number  of  lines  about  the  line  to  be
    cleaned.   After  fitting  for  the intensity scale pixels are found
    which deviate from the profile by a specified amount.   The  profile
    value   replaces  the  deviant  pixel  in  the  extraction  and,  if 
    specified, also in the image file.  No prior  modeling  is  required

4.2  General MULTISPEC CL Scripts

     The  general  MULTISPEC CL scripts perform a series of steps needed
to extract the spectra from a specified  list  of  image  files.   These
steps  have  been found to generally perform the desired extraction task
fully.


        multiap_extract         echelle_extract

multiap_extract
    The specified multi-aperture plate  images  are  extracted.   If  no
    starting  solution  image,  one which has previously been extracted,
    is specified then the script performs an automatic  search  for  the
    specified  number  of  spectra.   Otherwise  the  solution  from the
    starting image is used as the  initial  model.   The  background  is
    then  determined.   This is followed by a series of fitting steps on
    swaths of data.  (For further details on the fitting steps  see  the
    Algorithms   paper).    A   MODEL_EXTRACT   and   cleaning  follows. 
    Finally, the extraction is correlated with  the  specified  aperture
    plate  using  AP_PLATE.   If  there  was no starting image then this
    extraction becomes the initial solution  image.   Subsequent  images
    are extracted starting from the initial solution image.

                                        (mode = ql)

echelle_extract
    The   specified  echelle  images  are  extracted.   If  no  starting 
    solution  image,  one  which  has  previously  been  extracted,   is 
    specified  then  the  script  performs  an  automatic search for the
    specified  number  of  orders.   Otherwise  the  solution  from  the 
    starting   image  is  used  as  the  initial  starting  point.   The 
    background  is  then  determined.   Finally  a   STRIP_EXTRACT   and 
    cleaning  is  performed.   If  there was no starting image then this
    extraction becomes the initial solution  image.   Subsequent  images
    are extracted starting from the initial solution image.

5.  Outline of a MULTISPEC Reduction

     The  following  outline  is for the reduction of a cryogenic camera
multi-aperture plate.  All the programmer supplied  default  values  are
used.

(1) The  data  is  read  from  the observing tape(s) using RCAMERA.  The
    image files created are ap165.3, ap165.4,  ...,  ap165.9.   This  is
    easily  accomplished  by  using  the filename prefix "ap165." in the
    RCAMERA program.  The raw images may be examined at  this  point  on
    a display.

(2) The  images  are  debiased  using DEBIAS with all the "ap165." files
    specified.  The debias program  knows  about  the  location  of  the
    bias strip for the cryogenic camera.

(3) A  a  flat  field  is  created  using  MULTISPEC_FLAT  in  which the
    desired  quartz  frames  are  specified  and  a  flat  field   image 
    filename  is  defined.  The created flat field image may be examined
    on an image display if desired.

(4) All the  debiased  images  are  divided  by  the  flat  field  using
    FLAT_DIVIDE.

(5) The  script  MULTIAP_EXTRACT  is  run  in  which  the aperture plate
    number, the number of spectra, and the image files to  be  extracted
    are  specified.   The  number  of  spectra  is found by examining an
    image on an image display or by plotting a cut  across  the  spectra
    using a general image profile program.

(6) Finally,  the  extracted  spectra  are  formatted  for  the ONEDSPEC
    package using TO_ONEDSPEC with the extracted images specified.
