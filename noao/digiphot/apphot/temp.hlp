    1. Added an imflush after the last write in apconolve which cured
    a "pixel file is truncated error". This error showed up when
    daofind was run on an image that was 641 by 1025 but not on
    one that was 640 by 1024. Apparently this problem has been there
    all along but only occurs very rarely.
