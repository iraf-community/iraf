DESCRIPTION

The radial profiles of a set of objects in the IRAF image \fIimage\fR is
computed and plotted
from the object center out to the radius \fIradius * scale\fR in steps of
\fIstep * scale\fR pixels.

RADPROF can be run either interactively or in batch mode by setting the
interactive switch to yes. In interactive mode starting x and y coordinates
can either be read directly from the image cursor or read from the text
file specified by \fIcoords\fR. In interactive mode the results will be
plotted on the terminal. In batch mode the estimated positions
can be read from the text file \fIcoords\fR or the image cursor parameter
\fIcursor\fR can be redirected to a text file containing a list of cursor
commands.

ALGORITHMS

Prior to computing the radial profile of the star, RADPROF computes the
center, estimates a sky value and does aperture photometry on the star
using the parameters in \fIdatapars\fR, \fIcenterpars\fR, \fIfitskypars\fR,
and \fIphotpars\fR.
The radial and intensity coordinates of all the pixels
inside \fIradius * scale\fR are computed using the calculated center and
sky values and fit to a least squares
cubic spline
of order \fIorder\fR with optional rejection.
The fit is interpolated at intervals of \fIstep_size * scale\fR to derive
the output profile and estimate the full width at half maximum of the
object. The noise model parameters are defined in \fIdatapars\fR.

.ih
OUTPUT

In interactive mode the following quantities are printed on the standard
output as each object is measured.  Error is a simple string which
indicates whether an error was encountered in the
the centering algorithm, the sky fitting algorithm, the photometry
algorithm or the spline fitting algorithm respectively.
Mag and merr are the mangnitudes and errors in
aperture N and xcenter, ycenter and msky are the
x and y centers and the sky value respectively.
Pfwhm is the fitted full width half maximum of the fitted radial profile.

.nf
    image  xcenter  ycenter  msky  pfwhm  mag[N]  merr[N] iers
.fi

In both interactive and batch mode full output is written to the text file
\fIoutput\fR. At the beginning of each file is a header listing the
current values of the parameters when the first stellar record was written.
These parameters can be subsequently altered. For each star measured the
following record is written

.nf
	image  xinit  yinit  id  coords  lid
	   xcenter  ycenter  xshift  yshift  xerr  yerr  cier error
	   msky  stdev  sskew  nsky  nsrej  sier  serror
	   itime  airmass  filter
	   rapert  sum  area  mag  merr  pier  perr
	   pfwhm  inorm  tinorm  rier  rerror
	   pradius  intensity  tintensity
.fi

Image and coords are the name of the image and coordinate file respectively.
Id and lid are the sequence numbers of stars in the output and coordinate
files respectively. Cier and cerror are the error code and accompanying
error message respectively.  Xinit, yinit, xcenter, ycenter, xshift, yshift,
and xerr, yerr are self explanatory and output in pixel units. The sense of
the xshift and yshift definitions is the following.

.nf
	xshift = xcenter - xinit
	yshift = ycenter - yinit
.fi

Sier and serror are the error code and accompanying error message respectively.
Msky, stdev and sskew are the sky value,
standard deviation and skew respectively. Nsky and nsrej are the number of
sky pixels and the number of sky pixels rejected respectively.

Itime is the exposure time, airmass is self-evident, and filter is an id
string specifying the filter used during the observation.

Rapert, sum, and area are the radius of the aperture in pixels, the total
number of counts including sky in the aperture and the area of the aperture
in square pixels. Mag and merr are the magnitude and error in the magnitude
in the aperture. Pier and perror are photometry error code and accompanying
error message.

Pfwhm is the full width at half intensity of the fitted profile. Inorm and
tinorm are the normalization factors for the fitted radial profile and the
fitted total intensity profile respectively. Rier and rerror are the spline
fitting error code and accompanying error message. Pradius, intensity
and tintensity are the computed radii, intensity and total intensity
values at each radial step.

ERRORS

If the object centering was error free then the field cier will be zero.
Non-zero values of cier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0       # No error
	21      # The centering box is off image
	22      # The centering box is partially off the image
	23      # The S/N ratio is low in the centering box
	24      # There are two few points for a good fit
	25      # The x or y center fit is singular
	26      # The x or y center fit did not converge
	27      # The x or y center shift is greater than maxshift
	28      # There is bad data in the centering box
.fi

If all goes well during the sky fitting process then the error code sier
will be 0. Non-zero values of sier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0       # No error
	1       # There are no sky pixels in the sky annulus
	2       # Sky annulus is partially off the image
	3       # The histogram of sky pixels has no width
	4       # The histogram of sky pixels is flat or concave
	5       # There are too few points for a good sky fit
	6       # The sky fit is singular
	7       # The sky fit did not converge
	8       # The graphics stream is undefined
	9       # The file of sky values does not exist
	10      # The sky file is at EOF
	11      # Cannot read the sky value correctly
	12      # The best fit parameter are non-physical
.fi

If no error occursor during the measurment of the magnitudes then pier is
0. Non-zero values of pier flag the following error conditins.

.nf
	0       # No error
	41      # The aperture is off the image
	42      # The aperture is partially off the image
	43      # The sky value is undefined
	45      # There is bad data in the aperture
.fi

If no error occursor during the profile fitting then rier is 0.
Non-zero values of rier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0       # No error
	161     # The profile profile is off the image
	162     # The profile region is partially off the image
	163	# There are too few points in the profile
	164	# The fit is singular
	165     # The sky value is undefined

BUGS

It is currently the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
image displayed in the frame is the same as that specified by the image
parameter.

Commands which draw to the image display are currently disabled.
The TVMARK task in the proto package  can be used to draw simple marks
on the display. All the APPHOT marking commands will however function
if a contour plot is used in lieu of the image display.

Users should not be confused by the normally enabled markcur option in the
SUN/IMTOOL setup window. This feature is under the control of the
IMTOOL window and the APPHOT package has no control over it.
