centerpars -- edit the centering algorithm parameters

USAGE
centerpars
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls calgorithm = "centroid"
The centering algorithm to be employed. The "gauss" and "ofilter" options
depend critically on an accurate estimate of the fwhmpsf parameter in the
DATAPARS task.
The centering options are:
.ls none
The initial positions are assumed to be the true centers. The user may
wish to use this option to save time if the DAOFIND task which computes
accurate centers was used to detect objects.
.le
.ls centroid
The object centers are determined by computing the
intensity weighted means of the marginal profiles in x and y.
This is the recommended algorithm for APPHOT users.
.le
.ls gauss
The object centers are computed by fitting a Gaussian of fixed fwhmpsf,
specified by the DATAPARS fwhmpsf parameter, to
the marginal profiles in x and y using non-linear least squares techniques.
.le
.ls ofilter
The object centers are computed using optimal filtering techniques,
a triangular weighting function of half width equal to fwhmpsf, as
specified by the DATAPARS fwhmpsf parameter, and
the marginal distributions in x and y.
.le
.le
.ls cbox = 5.0  (scale units)
The width of the subraster used for object centering in units of the
scale parameter. Cbox needs to be big enough to include a reasonable
number of pixels  for center determination but not so large as to include
a lot of noise.
.le
.ls maxshift = 1.0  (scale units)
The maximum permissible shift of the center with respect to the initial
coordinates in units of the scale parameter.
If the shift produced by the centering algorithm is
larger than this, the computed center is returned with an error flag.
.le
.ls minsnratio = 1.0
The minimum signal to noise ratio for object centering. If
the estimated signal to noise ratio is less than this number the
computed center will be returned with an error estimate.
.le
.ls cmaxiter = 10
The maximum number of iterations performed by the centering algorithm.
All the centering algorithms use this parameter.
.le
.ls clean = no
A switch to determine whether or not symmetry-cleaning is to
be performed on the image subraster before centering.
APPHOT users should in general leave this switch set to "no".
.le
.ls rclean = 1.0  (scale units)
The cleaning radius for the symmetry-clean algorithm in units of
the scale parameter.
.le
.ls rclip = 2.0  (scale units)
The clipping radius for the symmetry-clean algorithm in units of
the scale parameter.
.le
.ls kclean = 3.0  (sigma)
The number of standard sky deviations for the symmetry-clean algorithm.
.le
.ls mkcenter = no
Mark the fitted object centers on the default display device. At present
this option is only supported if the display device is set to "stdgraph"
as in the case for example of running off a contour plot.
.le

DESCRIPTION

The centering algorithm parameters control the action of the centering
algorithms.  The default
values have been chosen for efficiency and to give reasonable results in
the majority of cases.
Note that many of the centering parameters scale with two quantities which
are data dependent, the scale of the image,
\fIscale\fR, and the standard deviation of the sky pixels \fIsigma\fR.
Both of these quantities are parameters in the DATAPARS task.
The data dependent parameter \fIchtreshold\fR is also stored here.

Using an initial position and \fIscale\fR supplied by the user,
a subraster of data
\fIcbox\fR / \fIscale\fR pixels wide around the initial position
is extracted from the IRAF image.
If scale is defined in terms of the half-width half-maximum
of the psf then a single value of cbox once chosen 
will work well for centering objects in images of different seeing and
detector characteristics.

The symmetry-clean algorithm may be optionally applied
to the image subraster prior to centering. The cleaning algorithm attempts
to correct defects in the image subraster by assuming that the image has radial
symmetry and comparing pixels on opposite sides of the center of symmetry.
The center of symmetry is assumed to be the maximum pixel in the subraster.
However if the maximum pixel
is more than \fImaxshift / scale\fR from the initial center, the initial
center is used as the center of symmetry.  Pixels which are inside the
cleaning radius are not edited.
Pairs of pixels in the cleaning region, r > \fIrclean / scale\fR
and r <= \fIrclip / scale\fR
and diammetrically opposed about the center of symmetry are tested for
equality.  If the difference between the pixels
is greater than kclean * sigma, the larger value is replaced by the smaller.
In the cleaning region the sigma is determined by the
noise model assumed for the data.
Pairs of pixels in the clipping region, r > \fIrclip / scale\fR
are tested in the same manner
as those in the cleaning region. However the sigma employed is the sigma
of the sky background. APPHOT users are recommended to leave clean
set to "no".

Next the signal to noise ratio of the subraster is estimated. 
If the SNR < \fIminsnratio\fR, the new center is still computed but an error
flag is associated with that object.

New centers are computed using the centering algorithm specified by
\fIcalgorithm\fR, the data specified by \fIcbox / scale\fR, and points
that are \fIdatapars.cthreshold\fR above the local minimum.
The default algorithm is \fIcentroid\fR. This centering algorithm
computes the marginal distributions in x and y of the extracted subraster.
The intensity weighted mean and mean error of the x and y marginal
distributions are computed using only points in the marginal array above
the minimum data pixel plus a threshold value which is either the mean
or \fIcthreshold\fR if cthreshold is greater than zero.
This algorithm is similar to that used in MPC (Mountain Photometry Code).
Note that this is the only centering algorithm for which the choice of
\fIdatapars.fwhmpsf\fR is not crucial.
The centering algorithm \fIgauss\fR computes the new
centers by fitting a 1D Gaussian function to the marginal distributions
in x and y using a fixed \fIdatapars.fwhmpsf\fR.
Initial guesses for the fit parameters are made from the data
values. The routines then iterate until a best fit solution is achieved.
The final choice \fIofilter\fR employs a variation of the optimal filtering
technique in which the profile is simulated by a triangle function of
width \fIdatapars.fwhmpsf\fR.
Detailed descriptions of all the centering algorithms
can be found in the APPHOT specifications document.

If the computed shift
in either coordinate < \fImaxshift\fR / \fIscale\fR, the new center is
returned but an error flag is set.
