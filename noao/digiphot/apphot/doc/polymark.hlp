NAME
polymark -- create or review polygon and coordinate lists for input to the
polyphot task
.ih
USAGE
polymark image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
The list of input images used to define the polygons.
.le
.ls coords = "default"
The input / output center positions file. The center positions for each
polygonal aperture are read from or written to coords. There may more than one
center position per polygon. Center positions are written to coords 1 center
position per line. When the current polygon changes POLYMARK inserts a line
containing a single ';' after the last center position. If coords is
"default", "dir$default" or a directory specification then a center position
file name of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is
the directory, root is the root image name, extension is "coo" and version is
the next available version of the file. 
.le
.ls polygons = "default"
The name of the polygons file. The vertices of each polygon  are read from or
written to the polygons file. The polygons file contains a list of the
polygon vertices. Each vertex list is terminated by a line containing a  ';'
after the last vertex. If polygons is "default", "dir$default" or a directory
specification then an output name of the form dir$root.extension.version is
constructed, where dir is the directory, root is the root image name, extension
is "ver" and the version is next available version of the file. The number of
polygon files must be equal to the number of image files.
.le
.ls icommands = ""
The image cursor or image cursor command file.
.le
.ls gcommands = ""
The graphics cursor or graphics cursor command file.
.le
.ls wcsin = ")_.wcsin", wcsout = ")_.wcsout"
The coordinate system of the input coordinates read from or written
to \fIcoords\fR and \fIpolygons\fR. The image header coordinate system is
used to transform from the input coordinate system to the "logical" pixel
coordinate system used internally, and from the internal "logical" pixel
coordinate system to the output coordinate system. The input coordinate
system options are "logical", "tv", "physical", and "world". The output
coordinate system options are "logical", "tv", and "physical". The image
cursor coordinate system is assumed to be the "tv" system.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current image.
The  logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by the image
input/output routines to access the image data on disk. In the logical
coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a  2D image, e.g.
dev$ypix  and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are
always (1,1).
.le
.ls tv
Tv coordinates are the pixel coordinates used by the display servers. Tv
coordinates  include  the effects of any input image section, but do not
include the effects of previous linear transformations. If the input
image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a
2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]
are (1,1) and (200,200) respectively.
.le
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates invariant  with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image data.  For example, if the current image
was created by extracting a section of another image,  the  physical
coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical
coordinates will be different.  In the physical coordinate system the
coordinates of the first pixel of a 2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D
image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are (1,1) and (200,200)
respectively.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant
with respect to linear transformations of the physical image data. For
example, the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter
how the image is linearly transformed. The units of input world coordinates
must be the same as those expected by the image header wcs, e. g.
degrees and degrees for celestial coordinate systems.
.le
The wcsin and wcsout parameters default to the values of the package
parameters of the same name. The default values of the package parameters
wcsin and wcsout are "logical" and "logical" respectively.
.le
.ls cache = ")_.cache"
Cache the image pixels in memory. Cache may be set to the value of the apphot
package parameter (the default), "yes", or "no". By default cacheing is 
disabled.
.le
.ls graphics = ")_.graphics"
The standard graphics device.
.le
.ls display = ")_.display"
The default display device.  Display may be set to the apphot package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".  By default graphics overlay is
disabled.  Setting display to one of "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" enables
graphics overlay with the IMD graphics kernel.  Setting display to
"stdgraph" enables POLYMARK to work interactively from a contour plot.

DESCRIPTION

POLYMARK creates and / or displays center position and polygons files
suitable for input to POLYPHOT. For each image in the input list POLYMARK
creates a polygons file \fIpolygons\fR and center positions file \fIcoords\fR, 
if these do not already exist. The format of the polygons and center
position files is described in the OUTPUT section. 

Polygonal apertures are defined and drawn on the image display using
the image display cursor and then shifted to the desired center
using the image display cursor. At any point in the marking process
the user may rewind the polygon and coordinate file and draw the previously
defined polygons on the display.

The coordinates read from \fIpolygons\fR or  \fIcoords\fR are assumed to be
in coordinate system defined by \fIwcsin\fR. The options are "logical", "tv",
"physical", and "world" and the transformation from the input coordinate
system to the internal "logical" system is defined by the image coordinate
system.  The simplest default is the "logical" pixel system. Users working on
with image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the
parent image must use the "tv" or "physical" input coordinate systems.
Users importing coordinate lists in world coordinates, e.g. ra and dec,
must use the "world" coordinate system and may need to convert their
equatorial coordinate units from hours and degrees to degrees and degrees first.

The coordinates written to \fIpolygons\fR or \fIcoords\fR are in the coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsout\fR. The options are "logical", "tv", and
"physical". The simplest default is the "logical" system. Users
wishing to correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in
image sections or mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" coordinate systems.

If \fIcache\fR is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If cacheing
is enabled and POLYMARK is run interactively the first measurement will appear
to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the measurement
is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because POLYMARK
is accessing memory not disk. The point of cacheing is to speed up random
image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
sparse cacheing may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
present there is no point in enabling cacheing for images that are less than
or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
effect of cacheing in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
of objects in the top and bottom halfs of the image are alternated.

EXAMPLES

1. Create a coordinate list and polygon file using the image display and
image display cursor. Use polymark to both create and display the 
polygon and polygon center lists.

.nf
	ap> display dev$ypix 1 fi+ 

	... display the image

	ap> polymark dev$ypix display=imdg

	... type ? for an optional help page 

	... type g to enter the "define a polygon" menu
	... move the cursor to the first vertex, tap the space bar
	    to mark the vertex, and repeat for each vertex
	... type q to quit the "define a polygon" menu
	... mark each vertex only once, POLYPHOT will close the
	    polygon for you

	... move the cursor to the desired polygon center and
	    tap the space bar to record the polygon
	... repeat for all desired polygon centers

	... type g to define the next polygon

	    to mark the vertex and repeat for each vertex
	... type q to quit the polygon menu
	... mark each vertex only once, POLYPHOT will close the
	    polygon for you

	... move the cursor to the desired polygon center and
	    tap the space bar
	... repeat for all desired polygon centers

	... type q to quit and q to confirm the quit

	... output will appear in ypix.coo.1 and ypix.ver.1

	ap> display dev$ypix 2 fi+

	ap> display dev$ypix 2 fi+ 

	... redisplay the image

	ap> polymark dev$ypix coords="" polygons=ypix.ver.1 \
	    display=imdg

	... type l to mark the polygon list, note that since there is
	    no coords file the polygons are not shifted

	... type q to quit and q to confirm the quit
.fi

2. Repeat the previous example using an image section.

.nf
	ap> display dev$ypix[150:450,150:450] 1 fi+ 

	... display the image

	ap> polymark dev$ypix[150:450,150:450]] display=imdg wcsout=tv

            polygons=ypix.ver.2 display=imdg wcsin=tv

	... type m to mark the first polygon / polygon center on the display

	... type m to mark the next polygon / polygon center on the display

	... type l to mark the remaining polygons
.fi

3. Repeat example 1 using a contour plot instead of the image display.

.nf
	ap> show stdimcur

	... record the default value of stdimcur

	ap> set stdimcur = stdgraph

	... define the image cursor to be the graphics cursor

	ap> contour dev$ypix

	    tap the space bar
	... repeat for all desired polygon centers

	... type r to rewind the coordinate and polygon lists

	... type :.read ypix.plot1 to reread the contour plot

	... type l to display all the polygons ...

	... type q to quit and q again to confirm the  quit

	... output will appear in ypix.ver.3 and ypix.coo.3

	ap> contour dev$ypix

	... redraw the contour plot

	ap> polymark dev$ypix coords="ypix.coo.3" polygons=ypix.ver.3 \
	    display=stdgraph

	ap> set stdimcur = <default>

	... reset the value of the stdimcur parameter

BUGS

It is the responsibility of the user to make sure that the image displayed
in the image display is the same as the image specified by the image parameter.

Commands which draw to the image display are disabled by default.  To enable
graphics overlay on the image display, set the display parameter to "imdr",
"imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" to get red, green, blue or yellow overlays. It
may be necessary to run gflush and to redisplay the image to get the overlays
position correctly.

There are no restrictions on the shape of the polygon but the vertices
must be listed in order either clockwise or counterclockwise in the
polygons file.

It is not necessary to close the polygon when drawing on the display.
POLYMARK will complete the polygon for you.
