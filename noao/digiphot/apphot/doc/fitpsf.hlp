PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images containing the objects to be measured.
.le
.ls box    
The width of the fitting box in scale units.
.le
.ls coords = ""
The list of text files containing initial coordinates for the objects to
be centered. Objects are listed in coords one object per line with the
initial coordinate values in columns one and two. The number of coordinate
files must be zero, one, or equal to the number of images.
If coords is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then an
coords file name of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed and
searched for, where dir is the directory, root is the root image name,
extension is "coo" and version is the next available version number for the
file.
.le
.ls output = "default"
The name of the results file or results directory. If output is
"default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then an output file name
of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is the
directory, root is the root image name, extension is "psf" and version is
the next available version number for the file. The number of output files
must be zero, one, or equal to the number of image files.  In both interactive
and batch mode full output is written to output. In interactive mode
an output summary is also written to the standard output.
.le
.ls datapars = ""
The name of the file containing the data dependent parameters.
The critical parameters \fIfwhmpsf\fR and \fIsigma\fR are located in
datapars.  If datapars is undefined then the default parameter set in
uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls function = "radgauss"

.ls radgauss
A 2D radial Gaussian function is fit. The parameters of the fitting function
are: x and y center, sigma of the Gaussian, amplitude of the Gaussian and
the local sky value.
.le
.ls elgauss

.le
.ls interactive = yes

.le
.ls icommands = ""
The image cursor or image cursor command file.
.le
.ls gcommands = ""
The graphics cursor or graphics cursor command file.
.le
.ls wcsin = ")_.wcsin", wcsout = ")_.wcsout"
The coordinate system of the input coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR and
of the output coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR respectively. The image
header coordinate system is used to transform from the input coordinate
system to the "logical" pixel coordinate system used internally,
and from the internal "logical" pixel coordinate system to the output
coordinate system. The input coordinate system options are "logical", "tv",
"physical", and "world". The output coordinate system options are "logical",
"tv", and "physical". The image cursor coordinate system is assumed to
be the "tv" system.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current image.
The  logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by the image
input/output routines to access the image data on disk. In the logical
coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a  2D image, e.g.
dev$ypix  and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are
always (1,1).
.le
.ls tv
Tv coordinates are the pixel coordinates used by the display servers. Tv
coordinates  include  the effects of any input image section, but do not
include the effects of previous linear transformations. If the input
image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a
2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]
are (1,1) and (200,200) respectively.
.le
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates invariant  with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image data.  For example, if the current image
was created by extracting a section of another image,  the  physical
coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical
coordinates will be different.  In the physical coordinate system the
coordinates of the first pixel of a 2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D
image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are (1,1) and (200,200)
respectively.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant
with respect to linear transformations of the physical image data. For
example, the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter
how the image is linearly transformed. The units of input world coordinates
must be the same as those expected by the image header wcs, e. g.
degrees and degrees for celestial coordinate systems.
.le
The wcsin and wcsout parameters default to the values of the package
parameters of the same name. The default values of the package parameters
wcsin and wcsout are "logical" and "logical" respectively.
.le
.ls cache = ")_.cache"
Cache the image pixels in memory. Cache may be set to the value of the apphot
package parameter (the default), "yes", or "no". By default cacheing is 
disabled.
.le
.ls verify = ")_.verify"
Verify the critical parameters in non-interactive mode ? Verify may be set to
the apphot package parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls update = ")_.update"
Update the critical parameters in non-interactive mode if verify is set of
"yes" ? Update may be set to the apphot package parameter value (the default),
"yes", or "no".

.le
.ls verbose = ")_.verbose"
Print messages on the terminal in non-interactive mode ? Verbose may be set
to the apphot package parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".

.le
.ls graphics = ")_.graphics"
The default graphics device.  Graphics may be set to the apphot package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls display = ")_.display"
The default display device.  Display may be set to the apphot package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".  By default graphics overlay
is disabled.  Setting display to one of "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy"
enables graphics overlay with the IMD graphics kernel.  Setting display to
"stdgraph" enables FITPSF to work interactively from a contour plot.

DESCRIPTION

FITPSF models the stellar brightness distribution of objects in the IRAF image
\fIimage\fR using non-linear least squares techniques and writes the
list of model parameters and associated errors to the file \fIoutput\fR.
Initial coordinates for the objects are read from the image cursor or
the text file \fIcoords\fR.  Pixels in a subraster of width \fIbox * scale\fR
are extracted and used in the fit.

The coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR are assumed to be in coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsin\fR. The options are "logical", "tv", "physical",
and "world" and the transformation from the input coordinate system to
the internal "logical" system is defined by the image coordinate system.
The simplest default is the "logical" pixel system. Users working on with
image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" input coordinate systems.
Users importing coordinate lists in world coordinates, e.g. ra and dec,
must use the "world" coordinate system and may need to convert their
equatorial coordinate units from hours and degrees to degrees and degrees first.

The coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR are in the coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsout\fR. The options are "logical", "tv",
and "physical". The simplest default is the "logical" system. Users
wishing to correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in
image sections or mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" coordinate systems.

If \fIcache\fR is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If cacheing
is enabled and FITPSF is run interactively the first measurement will appear
to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the measurement
is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because FITPSF
is accessing memory not disk. The point of cacheing is to speed up random
image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
sparse cacheing may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
present there is no point in enabling cacheing for images that are less than
or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
effect of cacheing in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
of objects in the top and bottom halfs of the image are alternated.

FITPSF can be run either interactively or in batch mode by setting the
parameter \fIinteractive\fR. In interactive mode starting x and y positions
can either be read directly from the image cursor or read from the text
file specified by \fIcoords\fR. In batch mode the estimated
positions can be read from the text file \fIcoords\fR or the image cursor
parameter \fIicommands\fR can be redirected to a text file containing
a list of cursor commands.

ALGORITHMS

The fitting parameters are \fIfunction\fR, the functional form of the model
to be fit, \fImaxiter\fR, the maximum number of iterations per fit,
\fIkreject\fR, the K-sigma rejection limit and \fInreject\fR, the maximum
number of rejection cycles. The currently available functions are a 2D
moments analysis "moments", a 2D radial Gaussian "radgauss",  and a
2D elliptical Gaussian "elgauss".

The weighting of the fit is determined by the parameter \fInoise\fR in the 
\fIdatapars\fR file. The two options are \fIconstant\fR, in which all the
weights are set to 1 and \fIpoisson\fR in which the weights are equal to
the inverse of the counts divided by the image gain read from the datapars
\fIgain\fR or \fIepadu\fR parameters plus the square of the readout noise
determined from the datapars parameters \fIccdread\fR or \fIreadnoise\fR.
If \fIfunction\fR is either "radgauss" or "ellgauss" then the datapars
parameter \fIfwhmpsf\fR is used to determine the initial guess for the
Gaussian sigma.  The datapars parameter \fIthreshold\fR determines the
intensity threshold above which the moment analysis is performed.

.ih
OUTPUT

In interactive mode the following quantities are printed on the
terminal as shown below, for the radial Gaussian, elliptical Gaussian and
moments functions respectively.

.nf
    image  xcenter  ycenter  rsigma  amplitude  sky  err

    image  xcenter  ycenter  xsigma  ysigma rot  amplitude  sky  err

    image  xcenter  ycenter  rgyrat  ellip  pa amplitude  sky  err
.fi

In both interactive and batch mode the full output is written to the
text file \fIoutput\fR. At the beginning of each file is a header
listing the values of the parameters when the first stellar
record was written. These parameters can be subsequently altered.
For each star measured the following record is written for the radial
Gaussian, elliptical Gaussian, and moments functions respectively.

.nf

	    error
.fi

Image and coords are the name of the image and coordinate files respectively.
Id and lid are the sequence numbers of stars in the output and coordinate
files respectively and xinit and yinit are the initial positions.
Xcenter and ycenter are the computed x and y
positions of the object. Rsigma, xsigma and ysigma are the distance from
the center of the Gaussian at which the Gaussian is equal to exp (-0.5)
of its central value. Xsigma and ysigma refer to those values along the major
and minor axes of the ellipse respectively. The amplitude and sky refer to
the amplitude of
the Gaussian function and a constant background value respectively.
If function = "moments" amplitude and sky refer to the total intensity
above threshold and sky is the threshold value. Rot and pa are position angles
of the major axis measured counter-clockwise with respect to the x axis.
Rgyrat is the radius
of gyration of the object and ellip its ellipticity.
Quantities prefixed by an e represent the errors in the corresponding
fitted parameters.

.ih
ERRORS

field described above is 0. Non-zero values of ier flag the following error
conditions.

.nf
          0     # No error
	401     # The fitting box is off the image
	402     # The fitting box is partially off the image
	403     # There are too few points to fit the function
	404     # The fit is singular
	405     # The fit did not converge

BUGS

In interactive mode the user should not change the type function to be fit
after the first record is written to the output file. In this case the file
header and record structure will not match.

It is currently the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
image displayed in the frame is the same as that specified by the image
parameter.

Commands which draw to the image display are disabled by default.
To enable graphics overlay on the image display, set the display
parameter to "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" to get red, green,
blue or yellow overlays and set the  mkbox switch to"yes".
It may be necessary to run gflush and to redisplay the image
to get the overlays position correctly.
