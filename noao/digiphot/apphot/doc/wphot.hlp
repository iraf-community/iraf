PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images containing the objects to be measured.
.le
.ls skyfile = ""
The list of text files containing the sky values, of the measured objects,
one object per line with x, y, the sky value, sky sigma, sky skew, number of sky
pixels and number of rejected sky pixels in columns one to seven respectively.
The number of sky files must be zero, one, or equal to the number of input
images. A skyfile value is only requested if \fIfitskypars.salgorithm\fR =
"file" and if WPHOT is run non-interactively.
.le
.ls coords = ""
The list of text files containing initial coordinates for the objects to
be centered. Objects are listed in coords one object per line with the
initial coordinate values in columns one and two. The number of coordinate
files must be zero, one, or equal to the number of images. If coords is
"default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then a coords file name
of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is the
directory, root is the root image name, extension is "coo" and version is
the next available version number for the file.
.le
.ls output = "default"
The name of the results file or results directory. If output is
"default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then an output file name
of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is the
directory, root is the root image name, extension is "omag" and version is
the next available version number for the file. The number of output files
must be zero, one, or equal to the number of image files.  In both interactive
and batch mode full output is written to output. In interactive mode
an output summary is also written to the standard output.
.le
.ls plotfile = ""
The name of the file containing radial profile plots of the stars written
to the output file. If plotfile is defined then a radial profile plot
is written to plotfile every time a record is written to \fIoutput\fR.
The user should be aware that this can be a time consuming operation.
.le
.ls datapars = ""
The name of the file containing the data dependent parameters. The critical
parameters \fIfwhmpsf\fR and \fIsigma\fR are located here. If \fIdatapars\fR
is undefined then the default parameter set in uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls centerpars = ""
The name of the file containing the centering parameters. The critical
parameters \fIcalgorithm\fR and \fIcbox\fR are located here.
If \fIcenterpars\fR is undefined then the default parameter set in
uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls fitskypars = ""
The name of the text file containing the sky fitting parameters. The critical
parameters \fIsalgorithm\fR, \fIannulus\fR, and \fIdannulus\fR are located here.
If \fIfitskypars\fR is undefined then the default parameter set in uparm
directory is used.
.le
.ls photpars = ""
The name of the file containing the photometry parameters. The critical
parameter \fIapertures\fR is located here.  If \fIphotpars\fR is undefined
then the default parameter set in uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls interactive = yes
Run the task interactively ?
.le
.ls radplots = no
If \fIradplots\fR is "yes" and PHOT is run in interactive mode, a radial
profile of each star is plotted on the screen after the star is measured.
.le
.ls icommands = ""
The image display cursor or image cursor command file.
.le
.ls gcommands = ""
The graphics cursor or graphics cursor command file.
.le
.ls wcsin = ")_.wcsin", wcsout = ")_.wcsout"
The coordinate system of the input coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR and
of the output coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR respectively. The image
header coordinate system is used to transform from the input coordinate
system to the "logical" pixel coordinate system used internally,
and from the internal "logical" pixel coordinate system to the output
coordinate system. The input coordinate system options are "logical", tv",
"physical", and "world". The output coordinate system options are "logical",
"tv", and "physical". The image cursor coordinate system is assumed to
be the "tv" system.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current image.
The  logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by the image
input/output routines to access the image data on disk. In the logical
coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a  2D image, e.g.
dev$ypix  and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are
always (1,1).
.le
.ls tv
Tv coordinates are the pixel coordinates used by the display servers. Tv
coordinates  include  the effects of any input image section, but do not
include the effects of previous linear transformations. If the input
image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a
2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]
are (1,1) and (200,200) respectively.
.le
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates invariant  with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image data.  For example, if the current image
was created by extracting a section of another image,  the  physical
coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical
coordinates will be different.  In the physical coordinate system the
coordinates of the first pixel of a 2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D
image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are (1,1) and (200,200)
respectively.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant
with respect to linear transformations of the physical image data. For
example, the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter
how the image is linearly transformed. The units of input world coordinates
must be the same as those expected by the image header wcs, e. g.
degrees and degrees for celestial coordinate systems.
.le
The wcsin and wcsout parameters default to the values of the package
parameters of the same name. The default values of the package parameters
wcsin and wcsout are "logical" and "logical" respectively.
.le
.le
.ls cache = ")_.cache"
Cache the image pixels in memory. Cache may be set to the value of the apphot
package parameter (the default), "yes", or "no". By default cacheing is 
disabled.
.le
.ls verify = ")_.verify"
Verify the critical parameters in non-interactive mode.  Verify may be set to
the apphot package parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls update = ")_.update"
Update the critical parameters in non-interactive mode if verify is yes.
Update may be set to the apphot package parameter value (the default), "yes",
or "no".

.le
.ls verbose = ")_.verbose"
Print messages on the terminal about actions taken in non-interactive mode.
Verbose may be set to the apphot package parameter value (the default), "yes",
or "no".
.le
.ls graphics = ")_.graphics"
The default graphics device. Graphics may be set to the apphot package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".

.le
.ls display = ")_.display"
The default display device. Graphics may be set to the apphot package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no. By default graphics overlay
is disabled.  Setting display to one of "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy"
enables graphics overlay with the IMD graphics kernel.  Setting display to
"stdgraph" enables WPHOT to work interactively from a contour plot.

DESCRIPTION
WPHOT computes accurate centers, sky values, and weighted magnitudes for a
list of objects in the IRAF image \fIimage\fR whose initial coordinates are read
from the text file \fIcoords\fR or image display cursor, and writes the
computed x and y coordinates, sky values and magnitudes to the text file
\fIoutput\fR.

The coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR are assumed to be in coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsin\fR. The options are "logical", "tv", "physical",
and "world" and the transformation from the input coordinate system to
the internal "logical" system is defined by the image coordinate system.
The simplest default is the "logical" pixel system. Users working on with
image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" input coordinate systems.
Users importing coordinate lists in world coordinates, e.g. ra and dec,
must use the "world" coordinate system and may need to convert their
equatorial coordinate units from hours and degrees to degrees and degrees first.

The coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR are in the coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsout\fR. The options are "logical", "tv",
and "physical". The simplest default is the "logical" system. Users
wishing to correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in
image sections or mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" coordinate systems.

If \fIcache\fR is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If cacheing
is enabled and WPHOT is run interactively the first measurement will appear
to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the measurement
is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because WPHOT
is accessing memory not disk. The point of cacheing is to speed up random
image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
sparse cacheing may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
present there is no point in enabling cacheing for images that are less than
or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
effect of cacheing in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
of objects in the top and bottom halfs of the image are alternated.

In interactive mode the user may either define the list of objects to be
measured interactively with the image cursor or create an object list prior
to entering WPHOT.  In either case the user may adjust the centering, sky
fitting and photometry parameters until a satisfactory fit is achieved and
only then store the final results in \fIoutput\fR. In batch
mode the initial positions are read from the text file \fIcoords\fR
or the image cursor parameter \fIicommands\fR is redirected to a text
file containing a list of cursor commands.

ALGORITHMS

WPHOT computes accurate centers for each object using the centering
parameters defined in the CENTERPARS task, computes an accurate sky value
for each object using the sky fitting parameters defined in FITSKYPARS task,
and computes magnitudes using the photometry parameters defined in the
PHOTPARS task. The data dependent parameter are defined in the DATAPARS task.

Three weighting functions are currently supported: constant, cone and gauss.
Constant weighting, the default gives identical results to the PHOT task.
Pixels are weighted by the fraction of their area inside the circular
aperture. For cone and gauss weighting an additional  triangular or gaussian
weighting function of full width half maximum equal to \fIfwhmpsf\fR is
applied to the pixels before aperture summing.

This task is currently experimental. Further algorithm work is required.

.ih
OUTPUT

In interactive mode the following quantities are printed on the standard
output as each object is measured. Error is a simple string which
indicates whether the task encountered any errors in the
the centering algorithm, the sky fitting algorithm or the photometry
algorithm. Mag and merr are the magnitudes and errors in
apertures 1 through N respectively and xcenter, ycenter and msky are the
x and y centers and the sky value respectively.

.nf
    image  xcenter  ycenter  msky  mag[1 ... N]   error
.fi

In both interactive and batch mode full output is written to the text file
\fIoutput\fR. At the beginning of each file is a header listing the
current values of the parameters when the first stellar record was written.
These parameters can be subsequently altered. For each star measured the
following record is written

.nf
	image  xinit  yinit  id  coords  lid
	   xcenter  ycenter  xshift  yshift  xerr  yerr  cier error
	   msky  stdev  sskew  nsky  nsrej  sier  serror
	   itime  xairmass  ifilter otime
	   rapert  sum  area  flux mag  merr  pier  perr
.fi

Image and coords are the name of the image and coordinate file respectively.
Id and lid are the sequence numbers of stars in the output and coordinate
files respectively. Cier and cerror are the error code and accompanying
error message respectively.  Xinit, yinit, xcenter, ycenter, xshift, yshift,
and xerr, yerr are self explanatory and output in pixel units. The sense of
the xshift and yshift definitions is the following.

.nf
	xshift = xcenter - xinit
	yshift = ycenter - yinit
.fi

Sier and serror are the error code and accompanying error message respectively.
Msky, stdev and sskew are the best estimate of the sky value (per pixel),
standard deviation and skew respectively. Nsky and nsrej are the number of
sky pixels and the number of sky pixels rejected respectively.

Itime is the exposure time, xairmass is self-evident, ifilter is an id
string identifying the filter used during the observation, and otime is
a string specifying the time of the observation in whatever units the
user has defined.

Rapert, sum, area, and flux are the radius of the aperture in pixels, the total
number of counts including sky in the aperture, the area of the aperture
in square pixels, and the total number of counts in the aperture excluding
sky. Mag and merr are the magnitude and error in the magnitude
in the aperture (see below).

.nf
        flux = sum - area * msky
         mag = zmag - 2.5 * log10 (flux) + 2.5 * log10 (itime)
        merr = 1.0857 * error / flux
       error = sqrt (flux / epadu + area * stdev**2 +
               area**2 * stdev**2 / nsky)
.fi

Pier and perror are photometry error code and accompanying error message.

In interactive mode a radial profile of each measured object is plotted
in the graphics window if \fIradplots\fR is "yes".

In interactive and batchmode a radial profile plot is written to
\fIplotfile\fR  if it is defined each time the result of an object
measurement is written to \fIoutput\fR .

.ih
ERRORS
If the object centering was error free then the field cier will be zero.
Non-zero values of cier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0        # No error
	101      # The centering box is off image
	102      # The centering box is partially off the image
	103      # The S/N ratio is low in the centering box
	104      # There are two few points for a good fit
	105      # The x or y center fit is singular
	106      # The x or y center fit did not converge
	107      # The x or y center shift is greater than maxshift
	108      # There is bad data in the centering box
.fi

If all goes well during the sky fitting process then the error code sier
will be 0. Non-zero values of sier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0         # No error
	201       # There are no sky pixels in the sky annulus
	202       # Sky annulus is partially off the image
	203       # The histogram of sky pixels has no width
	204       # The histogram of sky pixels is flat or concave
	205       # There are too few points for a good sky fit
	206       # The sky fit is singular
	207       # The sky fit did not converge
	208       # The graphics stream is undefined
	209       # The file of sky values does not exist
	210       # The sky file is at EOF
	211       # Cannot read the sky value correctly
	212       # The best fit parameter are non-physical
.fi

If no error occurs during the measurement of the magnitudes then pier is
0. Non-zero values of pier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0        # No error
	301      # The aperture is off the image
	302      # The aperture is partially off the image
	303      # The sky value is undefined
	305      # There is bad data in the aperture

.fi


4. Display and measure some stars in an image section and write the output
coordinates in the coordinate system of the parent image.

6. Repeat example 5 but assume that the input coordinate are ra and dec
in degrees and degrees, turn off verification, and submit the task to to
the background.

        ap> display dev$ypix 1

        ap> rimcursor wcs=world > radec.coo

        ... move to selected stars and type any key

        ... type ^Z to quit

        ap> wphot dev$ypix coords=radec.coo wcsin=world verify- inter- &

        ... output will appear in ypix.omag.6

        ap> pdump ypix.omag.6 xc,yc yes | tvmark 1 STDIN col=204

        ... mark the stars on the display
.fi


7. Run PHOT interactively without using the image display.

.nf
        ap> show stdimcur

        ... record the default value of stdimcur

        ap> set stdimcur = text

        ... set the image cursor to the standard input

        ap> wphot dev$ypix coords=ypix.coo.1

        ... type ? for optional help

        ... type :m 3 to set the initial coordinates to those of the
            third star in the list

        ... type i to enter the interactive setup menu
        ... enter the maximum radius in pixels for the radial profile or
            accept the default with a CR
        ... type v to enter the default menu
        ... set the fwhmpsf, centering radius, inner and outer sky annuli,
            apertures, and sigma using the graphics cursor and the
            stellar radial profile plot
        ... typing <CR> after the prompt leaves the parameter at its default
            value
        ... type q to quit the setup menu

        ... type r to rewind the coordinate list

        ... type l to measure all the stars in the coordinate list

        ... a one line summary of the answers will appear on the standard
            output for each star measured

        ... type q to quit followed by q to confirm the quit

        ... full output will appear in the text file ypix.omag.7

        ap> set stdimcur = <default>

        ... reset the value of stdimcur
.fi


8. Use a image cursor command file to drive the PHOT task. The cursor command
file shown below sets the cbox, annulus, dannulus, and apertures parameters
computes the centers, sky values, and magnitudes for 3 stars, updates the
parameter files, and quits the task.

.nf
        ap> type cmdfile
        : cbox 9.0
        : annulus 12.0
        : dannulus 5.0
        : apertures 5.0
        442 410 101 \040
        349 188 101 \040
        225 131 101 \040
        w
        q

        ap> wphot dev$ypix icommands=cmdfile  verify-

        ... full output will appear in ypix.omag.8
.fi

BUGS
This task is experimental and requires more work.

It is currently the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
image displayed in the frame is the same as that specified by the image
parameter.

Commands which draw to the image display are disabled by default.
To enable graphics overlay on the image display, set the display
parameter to "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" to get red, green,
blue or yellow overlays and set the centerpars mkcenter switch to
"yes", the fitskypars mksky switch to"yes", or the photpars mkapert
witch to "yes". It may be necessary to run gflush and to redisplay the image
to get the overlays position correctly.
