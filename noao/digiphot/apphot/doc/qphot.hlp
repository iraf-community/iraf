USAGE
qphot image
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images containing the objects to be measured.
.le
.ls cbox
The width of the centering box in pixels.
.le
.ls annulus
The inner radius of the sky annulus in pixels.
.le
.ls dannulus
The width of the sky annulus in pixels.
.le
.ls apertures
The list of aperture radii in pixels. This list is a string parameter with
the apertures listed individually and separated by comas.
.le
.ls zmag = 26.0
The zero point of the magnitude scale.
.le
.ls exposure = ""
The image header keyword containing the exposure time.
.le
.ls airmass = ""
The image header keyword containing the airmass of the observation.
.le
.ls filter = ""
The image header keyword containing the filter id of the observation.
.le
.ls epadu = 1.0
The gain in photons per adu. This is used to compute the magnitude errors.
.le
.ls coords = ""
The list of text files containing the coordinates of the objects to be
processed, 1 object per line with the x and y coordinates in columns
1 and 2 respectively. If \fIcoords\fR is the null string QPHOT will either read
from the cursor (default) or read the cursor commands from a file. In the
latter case the image cursor \fIcommands\fR is set to the name of a text
command file created by hand or with for example RIMCURSOR.
If coords is defined QPHOT activates the cursor and accepts
coordinate input from either the cursor or the list file (interactive
mode) or reads the coordinates out of the list file directly (batch mode).
The number of coords files is either 1 or the number of input images.
.le
.ls output = "default"
The name of the results file or results directory. If output is "default",
"dir$default", or a directory specification then an output name of the form
dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is the directory,
root is the root image name, extension is "mag" and version is the current
version of the file. If the output string is null then no output file is
written. The number of output files must be either 1 or
equal to the number of image files. In both batch and interactive mode
full results are written to output. In interactive mode a subset
of the results is written to the standard output.
.le
.ls plotfile = ""
The name of the file containing radial plots for the stars written to the
output file. If plotfile is not equal to null then a single radial plot
is written to plotfile for every record written to output.
.le
.ls graphics = "stdgraph"
The default graphics device.
.le
.ls display = "stdimage"
The default display device. This can be set to
stdgraph and QPHOT will run off the graphics device.
.le
.ls commands = ""
The image cursor. The image cursor can be read from a coordinate file.
.le
.ls cursor = ""
The graphics cursor.
.le
.ls radplots = no
If radplots is yes and QPHOT is run in interactive mode then a radial profile
of each measured star is plotted on stdgraph.
.le
.ls interactive = yes
Interactive or batch mode.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print messages in non-interactive mode.
.le

DESCRIPTION
QPHOT computes accurate centers, sky values, and magnitudes for a list of
objects in the IRAF image
\fIimage\fR whose coordinates are
marked on the image display interactively with the image
cursor or listed in a coordinate file,
and writes the computed x and y coordinates, sky values and
magnitudes to the text file \fIoutput\fR.
In interactive mode the user must define the list of objects
interactively with the image cursor.  In batch mode
the image cursor can be read from a text
file containing a list of cursor commands as specified by the \fIcommands\fR
parameter.

QPHOT computes accurate centers for each object using the centroid
centering
algorithm, pixels inside \fIcbox\fR and the default values of the
\fIcenterpars\fR parameters.
Accurate sky value for each object are computed using
the \fImode\fR algorithm, pixels inside the sky annulus defined by
\fIannulus\fR and \fIdannulus\fR, and the default values of the sky fitting
parameters as defined in \fIfitskypars\fR parameter set.
Magnitudes are computed using pixels inside the apertures defined by
\fIapertures\fR.
The user should set the gain \fIepadu\fR to ensure that the magnitude errors
are correctly computed and \fIexposure\fR to normalize the computed magnitudes
to an exposure time of 1 time unit. The zero point of the magnitude scale
can be adjusted by setting \fIzmag\fR. \fIAirmass\fR and
\fIfilter\fR are pure book-keeping parameters which may be useful to
preserve for future reductions such as calibration. 
The noise statistics are assumed to be Poisson.

OUTPUT
In interactive mode the following quantities are printed on the standard
output as each object is measured. Error is a simple string which indicates
whether the task encountered an error condition from
the centering algorithm, the sky fitting algorithm or the photometry
algorithm respectively. Mag are the mangnitudes in
apertures 1 through N respectively and xcenter, ycenter and msky are the
x and y centers and the sky value respectively.

.nf
    image  xcenter  ycenter  msky  mag[1 ... N]  error
.fi

In both interactive and batch mode full output is written to the text file
\fIoutput\fR. At the beginning of each file is a header listing the
current values of the parameters when the first stellar record was written.
These parameters can be subsequently altered. For each star measured the
following record is written.

.nf
	image  xinit  yinit  id  coords  lid
	   xcenter  ycenter  xshift  yshift  xerr  yerr  cier cerror
	   msky  stdev  sskew  nsky  nsrej  sier  serror
	   itime  airmass  filter
	   rapert  sum  area  mag  merr  pier  perror
.fi

Image and coords are the name of the image and coordinate file respectively.
Id and lid are the sequence numbers of stars in the output and coordinate
files respectively. Cier and cerror are the error code and accompanying
error message for the center computation.  Xinit, yinit, xcenter, ycenter,
xshift, yshift, and xerr, yerr are self explanatory and output in pixel units.
The sense of the xshift and yshift definitions is the following.

.nf
	xshift = xcenter - xinit
	yshift = ycenter - yinit
.fi

Sier and serror are the error code and accompanying error message for the
sky computation.  Msky, stdev and sskew are the sky value,
standard deviation and skew respectively. Nsky and nsrej are the number of
sky pixels used and the number of sky pixels rejected respectively.

Itime is the eposure time, airmass is self-evident, and filter is an
id string used to identify the filter used during the observation.

Rapert, sum, and area are the radius of the aperture in pixels, the total
number of counts including sky in the aperture and the area of the aperture
in square pixels. Mag and merr are the magnitude and error in the magnitude
in the aperture. Pier and perror are photometry error code and accompanying
error message.


.ih
ERRORS
If the object centering was error free then the field cier will be zero.
Non-zero values of cier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
0       # No error
21      # The centering box is off image
22      # The centering box is partially off the image
23      # The S/N ratio is low in the centering box
27      # The x or y center shift is greater than centerpars.maxshift
28      # There is bad data in the centering box
.fi

If all goes well during the sky fitting process then the error code sier
will be 0. Non-zero values of sier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
0       # No error
1       # There are no sky pixels in the sky annulus
2       # Sky annulus is partially off the image
.fi

If no error occurs during the measurment of the magnitudes then pier is
0. Non-zero values of pier flag the following error conditins.

.nf
0       # No error
41      # The aperture is off the image
42      # The aperture is partially off the image
43      # The sky value is undefined
45      # There is bad data in the aperture
.fi

EXAMPLES
1. Perform aperture photometry interactively for a few stars in n4147 using
the display and the image cursor.

.nf
	ap> set stdimcur = stdimage

	... define the image cursor

	ap> display n4147 1 fi+

	... display the image

	ap> qphot m92 5. 8. 15. 2.,4.,6.0 

	... move image cursor to objects of interest and tap space bar

	... a 1 line summary will be printed on the standard output
	    for each object measured

	... full output will be written to n4147.mag.1
.fi

2. Perform aperture photometry interactively for a few stars in m92 using the
contour plot and the graphics cursor.

.nf
	ap> set stdimcur = stdgraph

	ap> contour m92 >G m92.plot1

	... store the contour plot of m92 in the file m92.plot1

	ap> qphot m92 5. 8. 15. 2.,4.,6.0 

	... type :.read m92.plot.1 to read in plot file

	... move image cursor to objects of interest and tap space bar

	... a 1 line summary will be printed on the standard output
	    for each object measured

	... full output will be written to M92.mag.1
.fi

3. Setup the parameters interactively and run QPHOT from a contour plot.

.nf
	ap> set stdimcur = stdgraph

	ap> contour m92

	... plot appears on screen

	... adjust contour parameters until good plot acchieved

	ap> =gcur

	... type :.write m92.plot to make a metacode file of plot

	ap> qphot m92 5. 8. 15. 2.,4.6.

	... move cursor to a bright star

	... type i to enter interactive setup loop
	    mark the centering radius, inner and and outer sky annuli,
	    and the apertures

	... type w to save the parameters

	... type :.read m92.plot  to read in the contour plot metacode
	    file

	... move cursor to stars of interest and tap space bar 

	... output will apear in m92.mag.2
.fi

4. Run QPHOT in batch using a coords file generated by the DAOFIND task.

.nf
	ap> daofind m92 fw=3.5 thresh=30.

	... make a coordinate list by searching for objects with a fwhmpsf
	    of 3.5 pixels and a maximum pixel of at least 30 counts above
	    local sky

	... the output will appear in the text file m92.coo.1

	... output will appear in m92.mag.3
.fi

5. Run QPHOT interactively on the sun workstation using the IMTOOL window.
Setup the parameters interactively. This example assumes that the user
has no display device but does have a list of initial positions for his/her
stars generated for example by daofind.

.nf
	ap> set stdimcur = text

	... set the image cursor to the standard input

	ap> qphot m92 5. 8. 25. 2.,4.,6.

	... type :m 3 to move the coordinate list to star number three
	    which will be our setup star

	... type i in response to the image cursor prompt to enter the
	    interactive setup menu
	... enter maximum radius in pixels of the radial profile
	... set the centering aperture, inner and outer sky annulus, and
	    the apertures using the stellar radial profile plot and
	    verify
	... typing <CR> leaves everything at the default value

	... an alternate response to the above image cursor prompt would be
	    "xcoord ycoord 1 i" which would attempt to set up on a star
	    at position xcoord, ycoord

	... type r to rewind the coordinate list

	... type l measure all the stars in the list
	... a one line summary of the answers will appear on the standard
