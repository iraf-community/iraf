                  The Aperture Photometry Package
                 ----------------------------------

The apphot package contains routines which perform aperture
photometry in circular and polygonal apertures using fractional pixel
techniques. No point spread function fitting techniques are employed.
The photometry routines are most suitable for use on uncrowded
or moderately crowded fields.

The apphot directory structure is listed below. The package organization
is by task, for example the center subdirectory contains routines
specific to the center task or by function, for example the nlfit
directory contains the non-linear least squares fitting routines.
The wphot task shares alot of code with the phot task. Similarly
the polymark task shares some code with the polyphot task.
The .h files are all in lib as many of them are shared by several tasks.
