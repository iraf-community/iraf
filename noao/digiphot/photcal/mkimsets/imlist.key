 #  This file is a temporary file containing the entire list of images from   #
 #  which  the final  list of image sets wil be  formed.  The image  name     #
 #  appears in column 1. The image filter id appears in column 2. Additional  #
 #  fields, if defined, appear in succeeding columns.                         #
 #                                                                            #
 #  At the this point the user must edit the temporary image list to 1)       #
 #  remove unwanted images from the list 2) correct bad filter id values      #
 #  3) correct other bad field values, for example incorrect airmass or       #
 #  exposure time values if defined  4) reorder the image names so that the   #
 #  images in an observation set are adjacent to each other in the temporary  #
 #  image list 4) enter an image name of "INDEF" and the correct  filter id   #
 #  for any missing images.                                                   #
 #                                                                            #
 #  It is not necessary to remove images which have filter ids which are      #
 #  not in the filter id set as these will be removed by the grouping         #
 #  process.                                                                  #
