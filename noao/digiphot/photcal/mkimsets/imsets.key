 #  This file is  a temporary file containing the  named image sets produced  #
 #  by MKIMSETS, preceded by any errors or warnings produced by the image     #
 #  grouping algorithm. The image set  name appears in column 1 followed by   #
 #  a space, colon, space and the individual member image names in filter     #
 #  order, as specified by the idfilters parameter.                           #
 #                                                                            #
 #  At this point the user may edit the temporary image set file to 1)        #
 #  correct any erroneous image set names,  keeping in mind that image set    #
 #  names for single standard star observations should match those in the     #
 #  standard star catalog, 2) remove unwanted image sets from the image set   #
 #  file, 3) correct any image sets where the grouping process did not        #
 #  function correctly. It is not necessary to remove the warning and error   #
 #  messages if present. They will be automatically deleted before the final  #
 #  image set file is written.                                                #
