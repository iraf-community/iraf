This directory contains the supported standard star catalogs, format
description files, and a template transformation equation set for each
catalog.

The following standard star catalogs are supported.

	  elias.dat - the Elias JHKL standards catalog
	landolt.dat - the Landolt UBVRI standards catalog
       nlandolt.dat - the new Landolt UBVRI standards catalog
	odewahn.dat - the Odewahn BVR cluster standards catalog        (1)
	 porter.dat - the Porter UBVRI standards catalog               (2)
	  ukirt.dat - the UKIRT JHK standards                          (3)
         nicmos.dat - the NICMOS JHKKs standards catalog               (4)
         arnica.dat - the ARNICA JHK standards catalog                 (4)

Each supported catalog has an accompanying format description file which
describes which photometric indices are stored in which column. This file is
used by the MKCONFIG task to construct the user's configuration file. The
following format files are defined.

        felias.dat - format file for Elias JHKL standards
      flandolt.dat - format file for Landolt UBVRI standards
     fnlandolt.dat - format file for new Landolt UBVRI standards
      fodewahn.dat - format file for Odewahn BVR cluster standards
       fporter.dat - format file for Porter UBVRI cluster standards
        fukirt.dat - format file for UKIRT JHK standards
       fnicmos.dat - format file for NICMOS JHKKs standards
       farnica.dat - format file for ARNICA JHK standards

Each supported catalog has an accompanying template transformation file
which defines a default set of transformations equations. This file is
used as a template by the MKCONFIG task to guide the user in the construction
of a set of transformation equations. The following transformation equations
sets are defined.

     telias.dat - template trnasformations for Elias JHKL standards
   tlandolt.dat - template transformations for Landolt UBVRI standards
  tnlandolt.dat - template transformations for new Landolt UBVRI standards
   todewahn.dat - template transformations for Odewahn BVR cluster standards
    tporter.dat - template transformations for Porter UBVRI cluster standards
     tukirt.dat - template transformations for UKIRT JHK standards
    tnicmos.dat - template transformations for the NICMOS JHKKs standards
    tarnica.dat - template transformations for the ARNICA JHK standards

Notes:

(1) The Odewahn catalog contains data for the clusters NGC4147, NGC7006
    and NGC7790. The data was kindly formatted for use with photcal by Pat
    Hall (Steward Observatory).

(2) The Porter catalog contains unpublished UBVRI data and data compiled from
    the literature for the clusters M67, M92, NGC2264, NGC2419, NGC4147,
    NGC7006, and NGC7790 kindly provided by Alain Porter (KPNO) and formatted
    for use with photcal by Pat Hall (Steward Observatory). The following
    notes describe how the the catalog was compiled.

   Porter.dat contains unpublished UBVRI (**KRON-COUSINS** RI) photometry
   compiled by Alain Porter (KPNO) from personal data, photometry from the
   literature, and photmetry supplied by Lindsey Davis (KPNO).  It is
   basically intended to supplement BVRI data from Christian et.al. (1985).
   The differences between this data and Christian's, and between this data
   and the BVR data of Odewahn et.al. (1992), are well within the errors.
   The only exception is that for stars in common with Odewahn's NGC 7790
   data, this data is ~0.05 mag fainter than Odewahn's data, a difference
   at the 3-sigma level.

   Notes on individual clusters follow, giving the source of the ID numbers
   and references where finding charts can be found.

   M67     ID numbers are from Schild (1983), Eggen & Sandage (1964), or
	   Johnson & Sandage (1955).
   M92     ID numbers are from Christian et.al. or from Sandage (1966).
   NGC2264 ID numbers are from Christian et.al. or from Adams et.al. (1983).
   NGC2419 These values come straight from Christian et.al. and thus there
           is no U information for this cluster.
   NGC4147 ID numbers are from Odewahn et.al.
   NGC7006 ID numbers are from Christian et.al. or from Sandage & Wildey
           (1967).
   NGC7790 ID numbers are from Odewahn et.al., except for C-25 which is star
           25 of Christian et.al.
