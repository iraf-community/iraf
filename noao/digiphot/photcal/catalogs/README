This directory contains the supported standard star catalogs, format
description files, and a template transformation equation set for each
catalog.

The following standard star catalogs are supported.

	    landolt.dat - the Landolt UBVRI standards catalog

Each supported catalog has an accompanying format description file which
describes which photometric indices are stored in which column. This file is
used by the MKCONFIG task to construct the user's configuration file. The
following format files are defined.

	   flandolt.dat - format file for Landolt UBVRI standards

Each supported catalog has an accompanying template transformation file
which defines a default set of transformations equations. This file is
used as a template by the MKCONFIG task to guide the user in the construction
of a set of transformation equations The following transformation equations
sets are defined.
