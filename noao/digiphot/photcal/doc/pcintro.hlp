I. INTRODUCTION

The photometric calibration package PHOTCAL, contains a set of tasks
for computing the transformation from the instrumental system to the standard 
photometric system, and applying the computed transformations to 
the observational data. 

PHOTCAL distinguishes between two types of objects: \fIstandard stars\fR, 
and \fIprogram stars\fR. Standard stars have known instrumental and standard 
photometric indices. Program stars have known instrumental photometric 
indices, but unknown standard photometric indices. 

The standard indices of standard stars are contained in standard star
catalogs known as \fIcatalog files\fR. Each standard star catalog
contains only a single entry for a given standard star. The 
instrumental indices of both standard and program stars are 
contained in observations catalogs, known as \fIobservations files\fR.
There may be any number of observations per star in an observations
file. 

PHOTCAL uses a setup file called the \fIconfiguration file\fR to specify
the format of the input catalog and observations files and define the
transformation equations to be fit.

Normally the user must perform the following logical steps to
complete their photometric calibrations with PHOTCAL. However not all types
of data require all the following steps.

.ls [1]
Prepare a standard star catalog file using the MKCATALOG task.
.le
.ls [2]
Prepare a standard star observations file using the MKIMSETS and MKNOBSFILE
tasks or alternatively the MKOBSFILE task. 
.le
.ls [3]
Create the configuration file using the MKCONFIG and CHKCONFIG tasks.
.le
.ls [4]
Fit the transformation equations with the FITPARAMS task.
.le
.ls [5]
Apply the transformations to the standard star observations file using
the EVALFIT or INVERTFIT tasks.
.le
.ls [6]
Prepare a program star observations file using the MKIMSETS and MKNOBSFILE
tasks or alternatively the MKOBSFILE tasks.
.le
.ls [7]
Apply the transformations to the program star observations file using the
EVALFIT or INVERTFIT tasks.

II. THE CATALOG AND OBSERVATIONS FILES FORMAT

PHOTCAL catalog and observation files are simple text files containing any
number of columns. Columns are delimited by whitespace.
The first column is always reserved for the star id or 
matching name, and the rest contain actual data such as positions, magnitudes,
colors, errors, air mass, or any other quantity of interest.
Comments can be inserted
as separate lines at any point in the catalog or observations files
by beginning the comment line with the character "#".

The star id is used to 
match observations with catalog entries, and to determine which objects
are standard and which are program stars. Star ids may contain any non-blank
characters,
but lower case letters are converted to upper case, and
characters not in the set [A-Z,0-9,+,-,_] are removed before
star id matching. Catalog files must contain only a single entry per star.
Observations files may contain multiple entries per star.
Missing or unknown data values should be set to  INDEF not left blank.

Normal catalog and observations files records are restricted in length to
the maximum size of a text
file line in IRAF, currently 161 characters including the newline. The maximum
record length can be extended by replacing the star id in column 1
with the continuation character "*".

Several preprocessors are provided to convert data coming from other
IRAF packages, such as APPHOT and DAOPHOT, into a format suitable for PHOTCAL.
If a preprocessor for a specific type of data does 
not exist, then the user will have to use other IRAF facilities to convert it 
to into the appropriate format, or write their own.

III. PREPARE A STANDARD STAR CATALOG FILE

A standard star catalog suitable for input to PHOTCAL may be prepared in
one of the following ways. The advantages and disadvantages of each
method are briefly discussed.

.ls [1]
Use one of the standard star catalogs supported by PHOTCAL and maintained in
the directory "photcal$catalogs/". Each supported standard star catalog has
an associated catalog format description file defining the format of the
standard star catalog. The catalog format description file may be used as
input to the MKCONFIG task.  A list of currently supported standard star
catalogs and their format files can be found in the file
"photcal$catalogs/README".

The principal advantage of this option is that no data entry is
required on the part of the user. The principal disadvantage is that
PHOTCAL, in preparation for id matching,  loads the entire standard
star catalog into memory, even though the number of observed
standard stars may have been only a few dozen. For typical standard
star catalogs containing a few hundred objects this is not a problem,
but very large standard star catalogs should be avoided.
.le
.ls [2]
Prepare a standard star catalog with the MKCATALOG task. MKCATALOG
prompts the user for the catalog title, the id column name and width, and the
names and widths of all the data columns.
When column definition is complete, MKCATALOG writes the catalog
definition information into the catalog header and the associated catalog
format file and prompts for data.
The catalog format description file created by MKCATALOG may be used
as input to MKCONFIG.
Type "help mkcatalog" for the details of task usage.

The principal advantages of using MKCATALOG are that the task always
produces a PHOTCAL readable catalog and accompanying format description file,
and that the standard star catalog contains values only for those objects
that have actually been observed.
.le
.ls [3]
With a text file editor create or edit a standard star catalog which
conforms to the requirements of PHOTCAL as described in the previous section.

The principal advantage of this option is that the user can take advantage
of any spread sheet capabilities that his/her favorite editor has. The
principal disadvantage is that a format description file is not
automatically created along with the catalog.
.le
.ls [4]
Reformat an existing standard star catalog until it conforms to the
requirements of photcal as described in the previous section. In some
case this may require writing a local preprocessor program. PHOTCAL users
should be aware of the PROTO package tasks JOIN and FIELDS, the LISTS
package tasks COLUMN, and the UTILITIES package task TRANSLIT.
.le

The first few lines of a representative catalog file produced by MKCATALOG are
listed below.  V, BV, and UB stand for  the V magnitude, B-V color,
and U-B color respectively. The non-blank lines beginning with '#' at the
beginning of the file are for the internal use of the MKCATALOG task only,
and are ignored by other PHOTCAL tasks.

The accompanying format description file produced by MKCATALOG is listed below.
This file associates a column number with the column name and can be used
as input to MKCONFIG. The comments opposite

IV. PREPARE A STANDARD STAR OBSERVATIONS FILE

A standard star observations file suitable for input to PHOTCAL may be
prepared in one of the following ways. APPHOT and DAOPHOT users should
use options [1] or [2]. Other users must either enter their data by hand using
options [3] and [4], or write a local program to prepare their data
for input to PHOTCAL, option [5].

.ls [1]
If the standard star magnitudes were computed with APPHOT or DAOPHOT
and consist of many individual and repeated observations of standard star
fields, then use MKIMSETS
followed by MKNOBSFILE to create an observations file. MKIMSETS creates
an image set definition file, telling MKNOBSFILE which images taken
in which filters belong to the same observation of a given stellar field. 
For each observations file written, MKNOBSFILE
creates an associated format description file defining the format of
the new observations file and suitable for input to
MKCONFIG.  MKNOBSFILE is set up to run automatically once the image set file
is defined.  Type "help mknobsfile" for details.
.le
.ls [2]
If the standard star magnitudes in one or more colors were computed with
APPHOT or DAOPHOT and all the standard stars are in one stellar field,
use the MKOBSFILE task to create an observations file.
For each observations file created, MKOBSFILE
creates an associated format description file defining the format of
the new observations file, and suitable for input to
MKCONFIG. MKOBSFILE prompts the user for all
the required input. Type "help mkobsfile" for details.
.le
.ls [3]
Prepare a standard star observations file with the MKCATALOG task. MKCATALOG
prompts the user for the observations file title, the id column name and
width, and the names and widths of all the data columns.
When column definition is complete, MKCATALOG writes the observations file
definition information into the observations file header and the associated
format description file and prompts for data.
The format description file created by MKCATALOG may be used as input
to MKCONFIG if the "catalog" keyword (see the example in the previous
section) is  changed to "observations". 
Type "help mkcatalog" for the details of task usage.
.le
.ls [4]
With the text editor create or edit a standard star observations file 
which conforms to
the requirements of PHOTCAL as described in the previous section.
.le
.ls [5]
Write a local program to prepare the data for input to PHOTCAL.
.le

A sample image set file produced by MKIMSETS is shown below. The labels
STD1, STD2, ..., STD7 stand for standard star fields 1, 2, ..., 7 and
the c0* labels are the names of images of each field taken through filters
U, B, and V respectively.

.nf
    STD1 :  c023  c022  c021
    STD2 :  c024  c025  c026
    STD3 :  c029  c028  c027
    STD4 :  c033  c031  c032
    STD5 :  c061  c060  c059
    STD6 :  c064  c063  c062
    STD7 :  c069  c066  c065
.fi

The first few lines  of the observations file produced by
MKNOBSFILE using the above image set file both before and after the user
has edited in the correct standard star ids is listed below.
Note that there is usually more than 1 star in the field. In fact the
data set above included 17 standard stars and 5 additional stars that
the automatic star finding algorithm picked up.
Note also that some known bad data points in the 
original observations file have been replaced with the undefined value
INDEF.

V. PREPARE THE CONFIGURATION FILE

The configuration file is a text file, created by the user, that specifies
both the format of the input data and the form of the transformation equations.
A detailed description of the grammar and syntax of the configuration file
can be obtained by typing the following command.
.nf

ph> help config

.fi
The configuration file can be prepared in one of the following ways.

.ls [1]
Run the MKCONFIG task using the output of MKCATALOG or direct terminal input to
define the catalog file format, the output of the MKNOBSFILE
or MKOBSFILE tasks or direct terminal input to define the observations file
format, and one of the standard template transformation section files or
direct terminal input to define the transformation equations.
Users are urged to use MKCONFIG if they are new to PHOTCAL,
if the catalog file is one of the supported catalogs, or if the observations
file was made with one of the standard preprocessors MKNOBSFILE or
MKOBSFILE.
.le
.ls [2]
Use the text editor to make small corrections to an existing functioning
configuration file. This is the recommended method if the transformation
equations have changed from a previous PHOTCAL reduction session but the
format of the standard star and observations catalogs has not, or if
the user has become familiar with the PHOTCAL configuration file format.
.le
.ls [3]
Use the text editor to create a configuration file from scratch.
.le

The grammar and syntax of the configuration file can be checked with the
CHKCONFIG task.  If an error was found, the program will print the 
line and the word where the error was detected and the user must reedit the
file until no errors are found. 

A sample configuration file is shown below.

VI. FITTING THE PARAMETERS OF THE TRANSFORMATION EQUATIONS

The heart of the PHOTCAL package is the parameter fitting task FITPARAMS.
A detailed description of this task and its parameters can be obtained by
typing the following command. 
.nf

ph> help fitparams

.fi
FITPARAMS takes the observation files, catalog files, and configuration file, 
and computes the value of the fit parameters for each of the 
transformation equations specified in the configuration file. Equations will 
be processed in the same order in which they occur in the configuration file.
The output of FITPARAMS is a text database file containing one record,
identified by the transformation equation label, for each equation fit.
Successive fits are appended to the end of the database file. If more than
one fit has the same label the last fit performed will be used by the
evaluation tasks.

Only standard stars with known instrumental magnitudes and photometric
indices are used to compute the parameters of each transformation 
equation. Standard stars are identified by matching the id in the observations
catalog against the list of ids in the standard star catalog.

The fitting process can be either interactive or non-interactive. Interactive
fitting is the default. In interactive mode, the user 
is presented with plots of the data and the fit, can reject points
automatically using a k-sigma rejection algorithm, delete points interactively
with the cursor, change which parameters are to be fit and which are to be
held constant, and so on. A detailed description of
all the interactive options and colon commands can be obtained by typing
the following command. 
.nf 

ph> help inlfit

.fi

The database file produced by FITPARAMS for the catalog and
observations files listed in sections III and IV and configuration file
listed in section V is shown below.

VII. APPLYING THE TRANSFORMATIONS TO THE STANDARD STARS

This step is optional since the goodness of fit can be assessed more
efficiently from within the FITPARAMS task. However in some cases
the user may want a record of the fitted photometric indices for the
standard stars and the residuals from the fit.

There are two tasks for evaluating the transformation equations
and which one the user must select depends on how he/she has
defined the transformations equations.

If all references to the catalog file variables are on the left-hand side
of the transformation equations 
and the right-hand side is a function of the observations file
variables only, then the user should use EVALFIT. The transformation equations
used for reducing photoelectric photometry are often written in this manner.

If the left-hand side
of the transformation equation is a function of the observations file
variables and all references to the catalog files variables are on
the right-hand side of the transformation equations
then the user must use INVERTFIT. The transformation equations
for reducing CCD photometry are usually written in this manner.

The full output of INVERTFIT for the partial catalog and observations
files listed in section III and IV and the configuration file
shown in section V are listed below.
Only observations which were successively matched
with objects in the standard star catalog files are shown. The fits for
objects with undefined observational variables could not be successfully
inverted producing a row of INDEF values.

VIII. PREPARE A PROGRAM STAR OBSERVATIONS FILE

A program star observations file is prepared in the identical manner to
the standard star observations file as described in section IV.
In fact there is no intrinsic reason why standard star and program
star observations cannot occupy the same observations file since
they can be separated later by the EVALFIT and INVERTFIT tasks.
In the sample observations
file shown in section IV objects with names like 105-411 are the actual
standard stars and those with names like STD* can, for the purpose
of illustration, be regarded as program stars.

IX. APPLYING THE TRANSFORMATIONS TO THE PROGRAM STARS

The transformation equations are applied to the program stars in the same
way they are applied to the standard stars ad described in section VII.

The output of INVERTFIT for the partial catalog and observations
files listed in section III and IV and the configuration file
shown in section V are listed below. Only observations
which were not successfully matched
with objects in the standard star files are shown.
Note that the residuals from the fit cannot be computed for program
objects and are therefore not output.
