DESCRIPTION

CHKCONFIG parses the configuration file \fIconfig\fR line by line,
searching for syntax and/or semantic errors.  Its primary function is to aid
the user in setting up a complete and correct set of transformation
equations to be fit.  CHKCONFIG is run automatically by the task MKCONFIG,
but can also be run stand-alone at any time.
