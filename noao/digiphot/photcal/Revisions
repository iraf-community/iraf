photcal/doc/obsfile.hlp
    OBSFILE expects "incolumns" to have 10 numbers and not 9 and specified
    in the help file.  The extra column is for an object ID.  This may
    have been added in Aug. 2001 judging from the last modify date of
    the include defining the structure.  (1/24/03, Valdes)

    In the descriptions of the catalog files, the first catalog in the
    list "Elias" has the wrong filename for the formats and templates
    file.  Currently they are flandolt.dat and and tlandolt.dat, which
    should be felias.dat and telias.dat.

    were added to the obsfile, mknobsfile, and mkobsfile task help pages.
		
    (Davis, May 29, 2002)


photcal$mkobsfile/phagrow.x
    Added a missing sfree statement.

    (Davis, February 19, 2002)

photcal$mkobsfile/mkpkg
    Added a missing "../lib/obsfile.h" dependency to the mkpkg phsort.x
    declaration.

    (Davis, December 13, 2001)

photcal/fitparams/mkpkg
photcal/fitparams/fttrneqs.x
    Modified the interactiving fitting code so that the plots are automatically
    autoscaled when a new equation is fit. 

    (Davis, October 9, 2000)

photcal/mkimsets/t_imgroup.x
    Modifed the imgroup task to write out the image root names minus
    the directory specification if any to the output image sets file.

    (Davis, April 25, 2000)

photcal/mkimsets.cl
    The mkimsets script was leaving a temporary file in tmp$ if the review
    parameter was set to yes. This did not cause any trouble but might fill
    up the tmp$ area after a while.

    (Davis, April 24, 2000)

photcal/*/mkpkg
    Added some missing file dependencies and removed some unecessary ones.

    (Davis, September 20, 1999)

photcal/catalogs/nlandolt.dat
    Replaced the existing catalog which was an early version I got off a tape
    given to us by Arlo Landolt with a new version in which the positions
    are upgraded to agree with the table as published in the literature.

    (Davis, May 10, 1999)

photcal/photcal.cl
    Modified the package cl script to check and see if the tables package is
    already loaded before checking to see whether it is defined and then
    loading it.

    (Davis, August 1, 1998)

photcal/evaluate/phinvert.x
photcal/evaluate/phminv.f
    Modified the inversion routines to fit systems of equations which are
    singular more robustly, by forcing the appropriate columns in the
    inversion matrix to 0, and trying to fit the system in the least squares
    sense. 

    (Davis, Novemeber 12, 1997)


photcal$mkapfile.cl
    Modified the way the mkapfile script handles the tdump pwidth parameter
    to work around a change made to the tables.ttools.tdump task. The solution
    is not ideal because it leaves the value of tdump.pwidth.p_max
    modified but the parameter value is not changed.

    (Davis, August 15, 1997)

photcal/mkobsfile/t_obsfile.x
photcal/mkobsfile/mkpkg
photcal/mkimsets/t_imgroup.x
    Fixed a bug in the filter id parsing code that was causing filter ids
    that began with non-alphabetic characters [a-z][A-Z] to be incorrectly
    parsed, e.g 1U,1B,1V became 1, U, 1B, 1, V instead of 1U, 1B, 1V as
    intended.
    (Davis, 6/12/97)

photcal/catalogs/README
photcal/catalogs/ukirt.dat
photcal/catalogs/fukirt.dat
photcal/catalogs/tukirt.dat
photcal/mkconfig/catlist.key
    Installed the UKIRT JHK standards list in the photcal package.
    (Davis, 6/25/96)

photcal/evaluate/phinvert.x
    Modified the numerical inversion routines to avoid a floating point
    precision problem on the Linux system. This precision problem would
    cause the code to go into an infinite loop on some objects.
    (Davis, 5/7/96)

photcal/mkobsfile/phagrow.x
photcal/mkobsfile/phaigrow.x
    Modified the mkapfile/apfile task curve of growth fitting code to avoid
    going into an infinite loop while fitting the seeing radius parameter RO
    for an image. If RO cannot be fit after a reasonable number of attempts,
    RO is set to INDEF and a cannot converge message is issued to the user.
    The infinite loop situation can arise if there is bad data in the input
    file, where bad data in this sense means one or more curve of growths
    for object which are not stars, e.g cosmic rays and in some cases
    galaxies. Modified the plotting and output routines to deal with the
    INDEF RO case in a sensible manner.
    (Davis, 1/29/96)

photcal/mkapfile.cl
    Added some missing commas to the column template string sent to the pdump
    task when the input photometry files are ST tables, abug which resulted in
    the first 1-9 apertures not being written to the output file, and either
    a fit did not converge message in non-interactive mode or a floating
    divide by zero error message in interactive mode.
    (Davis, 10/6/95)

photcal/mkobsfile/t_apfile.x
photcal/mkobsfile/t_obsfile.x
photcal/mkobsfile/t_phimtable.x
    Modified the obsfile task (and as a result the mk(n)obsfile script task
    as well) to accept long (> 161 characters) lines in the input text
    files. The change avoids problems with the ttools task tdump used to extract
    the fields of interest: image name, x, y, magnitude, magnitude and error,
    exposure time, airmass, filter, and time of observation from ST tables
    and which due to the internal formatting can exceed the default size of
    an iraf image line.
    (Davis, 10/6/95)

photcal/mkobsfile/apfile.key
    Added a description of the 'b' key to the mkapfile/apfile key file.

    Added to suuport for reading the time of observation from the input
    photometry files and/or the observing parameters file and writing it
    to the output magnitudes file.
    (Davis, 4/28/95)

photcal/mkobsfile/phaimtable.x
    Due to a typo mkapfile/pfile were not writing the filter id that was read
    from the input photometry files into the output mag file correctly.
    (Davis, 4/28/95)
    
photcal/mkobsfile/t_apfile.x
photcal/mkobsfile/phagrow.x
photcal/mkobsfile/phaigrow.x
    Modified the mkapfile/apfile tasks so that objects with good data
    in only one aperture are not included in the fit but are included in
    output magnitudes file.
    (Davis, 4/27/95)

photcal/mknobsfile.cl
photcal/mkobsfile.cl
    Reversed the order in which the itime and otime columns were read from the
    input photometry files to avoid a problem with INDEF otimes being read
    from allstar/nstar/peak photometry files.
    (Davis, 3/21/95)

photcal/mkobsfile/phmatch.x
    The time of observations and airmass columns were switched on output
    if matching by position was turned off, resulting in airmass being
    written to the otime column and vice versa.

    (Davis, 2/9/95)

photcal/mkapfile.cl
    A reference was being made to a tdump parameter outside of the loop
    for processing ST binary tables files causing an "unknown task tdump"
    error for users which do not have the tables package defined.

    (Davis, 10/13/94)

photcal/mkapfile.cl
    A "> file" was being used instead if an ">> file" resulting in an error
    when there was more than one file in the input list and the script
    was unable to append to the output file.

    (Davis, 10/13/94)

photcal/mkobsfile/phmatch.x
    Fixed a bug in the filter matching code that was causing stars in an
    image which was the sole image in its set to be omitted from the output
    file, if tolerance > 0 and the image was not the last one in the image
    set.

    Added support for picking up the time of observation to the photcal
    preprocessor tasks obsfile/mknobsfile/mkobsfile.

    (Davis, 4/4/94)

photcal/evaluate/t_invertfit.x
photcal/evaluate/phinvert.x
    In cases where the user has not defined any set equations, invertfit will
    pass a 2D array with a zero valued first dimension to a numerical
    subroutine.  Although this array is never accessed and the invertfit
    appears to run correctly on most unix machines, invertfit under VMS
    produces an adjustable array dimension error.

    (Davis, 1/18/94)

photcal/fitparams/ftweights.x
    Fixed a bug in the fitparams weighting=photerrors scheme. Fitparams
    was not correctly assigning errors to catalog and/or observations
    variables defined in the set equations.

    (Davis, 8/8/93)

photcal/mkconfig/catlist.key
    Installed two new photometry catalogs in photcal, the odewahn BVR cluster
    standards catalog, and the porter compendium of cluster UBVRI standards.

    (Davis, 4/21/93)

photcal/
    Installed two new tasks from computing the aperture corrections
    MKAPFILE which uses apphot/daophot output as input, and APFILE
    which uses a user's text file as input.

    (Davis, 4/18/93)

photcal/mkobsfile/phmatch.x
    The position matching algorithm was failing in the case that: 1) there
    were multiple matches on the same star and 2) the closest match was
    not the first candidate found. The code was correctly matching to the
    closest star but forgetting to unset the match index for the previous
    candidate, confusing the indexing scheme, and resulting in stars being
    left out of the output file.

    (Davis, 4/2/93)

photcal/mkobsfile/t_obsfile.x
photcal/mkobsfile/phimtable.x
    The obsfile task was not decoding the image names correctly from the
    obsparams file when obsfile was called from the cl directly, instead
    of from the script tasks mknobsfile and mkobsfile. Since obsfile
    could not match the image names in the obsparams file with those in the
    imsets file it simply ignored the contents of obsparams. This problem
    was masking a second potential problem with normalization since the
    code was not testing for INDEF exposure times.

    (Davis, 3/1/93)

photcal/mkimsets.cl
photcal/mknobsfile.cl
photcal/mkobsfile.cl
    Modified the mkimsets, mknobsfile, and mkobsfile script tasks so that
    they can deal the new pdump expression parameter.

    (Davis, 25/2/93)

photcal/fitparams
    The fitparams task could produce incorrect weights, chi, and fitted
    parameter error estimates in the case that weighting=photometric and
    nreject > 1. This was occuring because the weight array was not being
    reinitialized correctly after each interation in the rejection cycle.
    The actual problem was in the inlfit package routine inlfit$inreject.gx.

    (Davis, 12/17/92)

photcal/mkcatalog/t_catalog.x
photcal/mkcatalog/phrecord.x
photcal/io/ioobs.x
    Added some missing sfree calls.

    (Davis, 9/2/92)

photcal/lib/warning.dat
    Added a newline to the end of the message printed by the photcal
    loader when the tables package is not available.

    (Davis, 5/29/92)

photcal/evaluate/t_invertfit.x
photcal/evaluate/t_phcheck.x
photcal/evaluate/phinvert.x
photcal/evalaute/pherrors.x
    Modified the invertfit task so that it can invert a set of equations
    for which one or more observations is missing if the remaining
    number of equations is greater or equal to the number of catalog
    variables to be solved for.

    (Davis, 4/17/92)

photcal/mkobsfile/phmatch.x
    Modified the preprocessor routines to write out the x and y values
    as measured in the original data frames instead of the shifted
    values.

    (Davis, 2/19/92)

photcal/mkobsfile/phimtable.x
    Modified the code which reads in the x and y shifts from the
    standard input to accept the syntax "xshift,yshift" as well
    as the syntax "xshift yshift". 

    (Davis, 1/8/92)

photcal/catalogs/landolt.dat
    Replaced the catalog landolt.dat with a new version containing the
    the mean errors of the standard indices instead of the standard
    deviations of the standard indices.

    Modified the fitparams, evalfit, and invertfit tasks to use the
    standard star catalog directory if the users sets the catalog
    parameter to one of the standard catalogs.

    (Davis, 2/1/92)

photcal/catalogs/tlandolt.dat
photcal/doc/mkconfig.hlp
photcal/doc/config.hlp
    Changed the values of the transformation equations zero points:
    u1, b1, v1, r1, i1 to 0.0 from values like 25.0. The new values are
    more consistent with typical apphot and daophot output, although
    these number will always be chip/telescope dependent.

    Changed the values of the color terms: u3, b3, v3, r3, i3 to 
    0.0 to more closely correspond with reality.

    (Davis, 2/1/92)

photcal/mkimsets/t_imgroup.x
    Added declarations for <fset.h> and <ctotok.h> to t_imgroup.x

    (Davis, 20/11/91)

photcal/
    Changed all references to dump in the photcal scripts to pdump.

    (Davis, 11/11/91)

    *** Ran spplint on the photcal package.

photcal/mkconfig/t_config.x
    The routine ph_rcolnumber was being declared as a boolean instead
    of an int inside the routines ph_rcsection and ph_rosection.

    The boolean routine ph_isident was being declared everywhere as an
    integer.

photcal/parser/prtable.x
    The routine pr_incol was declared as a function but called as a
    subroutine.

photcal/parser/prput.x
    The routine mct_getp was being called instead of mct_putp inside the
    routine pr_psym. It appears that this routine was not actually used
    so this does not seem to matter.

photcal/mctable/mctindef.x
    Amovkc and amovks were being called with the integer constants INDEFS
    and '\000' instead of short (INDEFS) and char ('\000'). This bug would
    affect test versions of photcal.

photcal/evaluate/phinvert.tx
    The determinant det was declared as an integer variable in ph_accum instead
    of a real. This was "almost" harmless because det was being computed
    as real and simply passed into the calling routine where it was interpreted
    as real. However one test was being done on det inside the ph_accum
    routine which might fail. This was not a problem in the test version of
    the code, but a bug introduced by my last minute changes.

    (Davis, 10/4/91)

photcal/evaluate/phinvert.x
photcal/evaluate/pherrors.x
photcal/doc/invertfit.hlp
photcal/evalfit.par
photcal/evaluate/t_evalfit.x

    1. Improved the convergence criteria of the invertfit routines by
    increasing the maximum number of iterations, testing the determinant
    of the curvature matrix and quitting if it is < 1.0 e-20, making
    sure that the parameter increments never are less than abs(.01),
    and terminating the fit if the rms starts to increase. These changes
    are not terribly important for the usual linear systems of
    photometric equations but are important for trying to invert higher
    order systems.

    2. Made catalog a hidden parameter in invertfit.

    3. Made catalog a hidden parameter in evalfit.

    4. Improved the help pages for invertfit and evalfit.

    (Davis, 10/8/91)

photcal/mkconfig.cl
photcal/mkconfig/t_config.x
photcal/doc/mkconfig.hlp

    1. Made template a hidden parameter with a default values of "".

    2. Made extensive modifications to the prompts to mprove the clarity
    of the task.

    3. Removed the options parameter. It caused to many headaches in the
    script.

    4. Made extensive modifications to the help page.

    (Davis, 24/7/91)

photcal/mkobsfile/phmatch.x
    1. The number of objects to be output was being computed incorrectly in the
    case that tolerance <= 0.0 and allfilters=yes.

    2. In some circumstances the preprocessor was computing the number of
    matched objects incorrectly resultings in a few dummy objects with
    undefined or incorrect data being written at the end of the real data. 

    3. If data from the same image existed in two different files and those
    files were not in order in the input list then the pre-processor
    would erroneously correct for the exposure time resulting in incorrect
    magnitudes in the observations file.

    (Davis, 19/7/91)

photcal/evaluate/t_invertfit.x
photcal/evaluate/phinvert.x
photcal/evaluate/pherrors.x
photcal/evaluate/phminv.f
photcal/evaluate/phcheck.f
    1. Modified invertfit to be able to deal with set equations which contain
    references to catalog variables which were not themselves referenced
    in the transformation equations.

    2. Tightened the convergence criteria for doing the inversion. 

    (Davis, 8/7/91)

photcal/mkobsfile/phimtable.x
    1. The code which reads in the images sets from the standard input has
    been modified to prompt only for the image name, not the image filter.
    If the filter id is defined in the database it will be used, otherwise
    filter ids will be assigned to the images in the order in which they
    occur in the parameter idfilters. The code which reads in filter id,
    exposure time, and airmass from the optional observing parameters file
    will now always prompt for a filter id.

    (Davis, 8/7/91)

photcal/mkobsfile/t_obsfile.x
    1. Fixed a bug in the pre-processor tasks (mknobsfile, obsfile, mkobsfile)
    wherein the pre-processors would crash if an image name was referenced
    in more than one image set. This bug was not in the original pre-processor
    but crept in when the sorting algorithm was re-done. Checking for
    duplicate image names has been removed from the sorting step and
    placed in the matching step where it belongs.

    (Davis, 8/7/91)

photcal/mknobsfile.cl
photcal/mkobsfile.cl
    1. Added the parameters verify and verbose to the mknobsfile task.

    2. Added the parameter verbose to the mkobsfile task.

photcal/obsfile.par
photcal/mkobsfile/t_obsfile.x
photcal/doc/mknobsilfe.hlp

    1. Removed the format parameter from the mknobsfile, obsfile and
    mkobsfile tasks.  The format description file is always assigned a
    default name based on the name of the observations file. Any pre-existing
    format file without an existing observations file will be deleted if a
    new catalog of the same name is requested.

    2. Clarified the documentation for mknobsfile by emphasizing the
    circumstances under which it is the preprocessor of choice. Switch the
    order of examples 2 and 3, to reflect likely-hood of use.

    3. Clarified the documentation for obsfile by emphasizing the circumstances
    under which it is the preprocessor of choice.

photcal/mkimsets/t_imgroup.x
photcal/mkimsets/imlist.key

photcal/doc/mkimsets.hlp

    1. Changed the mode of the mkimsets task parameter from auto to hidden.

    2. Changed the name of the mkimsets task parameter label to rename.

    3. Changed the name of the mkimsets task parameter check to review.

    4. Changed all the references to identifier in the mkimsets .hlp file
    to name.

    5. Modified the .key files and the documentation appropriately.

    (Davis, 4/7/91)

photcal/mkcatalog.cl
photcal/catalog.par
photcal/mkcatalog/t_catalog.x
photcal/doc/mkcatalog.hlp
    1. Removed the format parameter from the mkcatalog and catalog tasks.
    The format description file is always assigned a default name 
    based on the name of the catalog. Any pre-existing format file without
    and existing catalog will be deleted if a new catalog of the same
    name is requested.

    2. Removed the title parameter and modified the task to write the file
    name to the catalog title keyword. The task will complain if the file
    name is not the same as the title keyword if the user tries to add
    new records to an existing catalog. This will only happen if the
    user has renamed the catalog or copied it to another file.

    3. The code was modified to prompt for the error columns and to supply
    a default name of the form "error(name)" if a carriage return
    character was issued.

    4. The documentation was modified to explain how the default naming scheme
    of the preprocessors works. The examples were changed to use upper
    case letters for the standard photometric indices. A note of explanation
    was added regarding the EOF and CR characters (end-of-file and
    carriage return)

    (Davis 4/7/91)

photcal/mkobsfile/phmatch.x
    Fixed a bug in the matching code where stars which were not matched
    in the first filter would not be written to the observations files.

    (Davis 24/6/91)

    Changed the definition of the catalog directory from "newphotred$catalogs/"
    to "photcal$catalogs/".

photcal/inlfit/ingcolon.gx
    INLFIT was not recognizing the full colon command "tolerance". It would
    accept tol.

    (Davis 19/6/91)

photcal/mctable/mctput.gx
    Test for the legal column limits had an && instead of an || expression.

    (Davis 19/6/91)

photcal/evaluate/phprint.x
    The evalfit and invertfit programs were crashing with an error if
    a symbol that was defined in the configuration file was included
    in the print string.

    (Davis 11/6/53)

photcal/evaluate/invertfit.x
    Added a protection against a zero divide error which can occur if
    the fit is perfect.

    (Davis 11/6/53)

photcal/fitparams/fttrneq.x
    Changed an erroneous call to amovkr to the correct call to amovr. This
    fixed a bug which occurred when a user tried to quit the task
    but changed their mind at the last minute.

photcal/mctable/mctput.gx
    Table space was being reallocated as type real no matter what the
    data type of the table. This did not matter in previous versions
    of photcal but became a problem when the star id facility was added
    to inlfit.

photcal/fitparams/ftweights.x
    The routines for computing the weights were crashing if there were
    INDEF values in the observations.
