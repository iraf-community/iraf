1. Alter MKIMSETS, MKSTDOBS and MKOBS to work on tables after the text file
case is worked out. This will not change any new code developed only the
script level code (dump instead of txdump).

2. Alter the APPHOT output to permit storage of longer file names. This
causes no difference to the preprocessor but is very important for
practical reasons.

3. Keep the raw observations selected with MKSTDOBS? Useful for the user?
(no not necessary)

4. Question of APPHOT exposure time definition? add switch to obscatalog?
(done, always set to no for MKSTDOBS and MKPROGOBS, but might be useful
for user catalog)
