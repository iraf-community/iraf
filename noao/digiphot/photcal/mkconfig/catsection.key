THE CATALOG SECTION
    
    The  catalog  section  is  used  to  assign  names to columns in the
    standard star catalog, and optionally, to  associate  error  columns
    with the named columns.
    
    The  catalog   section  begins with the keyword catalog, followed by
    any number of name and error(name), column associations.
    
    Syntax
        catalog
        
        name number
        
        error(name) number
    
    The first declaration creates a name column number association.   It
    consists  of  a  name  followed by a column number. The name becomes
    the variable name for that column.
    
    The  second  declaration  creates  an  error  (name)  column  number 
    association.   It  begins with the keyword error, followed by a name
    in brackets and a column number.  The name must be the  name  of  an
    input  column previously declared in the catalog section.  The error
    declarations are optional.
    
    The column number must be a decimal integer greater than two,  since
    catalog  files  always reserve the first column for a matching name.
    This name is used to match objects in the catalog file with  objects
    in the observations file.

        error(BV)       5
