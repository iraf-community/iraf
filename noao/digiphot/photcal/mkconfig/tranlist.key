 *    The source of the transformation equation specifications must be one    *
 *    of the following:                                                       *

 *     landolt - a sample set of transformations to the Landolt UBVRI system  *
 *       STDIN - the standard input                                           *
 *    filename - a user supplied file                                         *

 *   Currently the landolt UBVRI standards catalogs are the only supported    *
 *   photometric standards catalogs. Usually the user will have to edit the   *
 *   sample Landolt transformation equations so that they conform to the      *
 *   filter set he/she used and the variable names defined in the catalog     *
 *   and observations section specifications.                                 *
 *                                                                            *
