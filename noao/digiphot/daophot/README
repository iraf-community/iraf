                  The Daophot Photometry Package
                 ----------------------------------

The daophot package contains routines which perform crowded-filed
photometry using point spread functions fitting techniques.
The aperture photometry package routines are used to provide initial
estimates for the magnitudes of these objects.

The daophot directory structure is listed below. The package organization
is by task, for example the nstar subdirectory contains routines
specific to the nstar task or by function.
The .h files are all in lib as many of them are shared by several tasks.

             |-addstar-------routines specific to the addstar task
             |-allstar-------routines specific to the allstar task
	     |-daoedit-------routines specific to the daoedit task
             |-daolib--------routines common to many daophot tasks
             |-doc-----------daophot documentation
             |-group---------routines specific to the group task
|-daophot----|-lib-----------daophot definitions or .h files
             |-nstar---------routines specific to the nstar task
             |-peak----------routines specific to the peak task
	     |-psf-----------routines specific to the psf/pstselect tasks
	     |-seepsf--------routines specific to the seepsf task
	     |-select--------routines specific to the grpselect/psfmerge tasks
             |-substar-------routines specific to the substar task
	     |-test----------directory of test data
