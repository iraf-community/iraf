USAGE

PARAMETERS
.ls varpsf = no
Is the PSF constant or does it vary across the image? The \fIvarpsf\fR
parameter is used by the PSF task to determine what type of PSF will
be computed. The variable
PSF option models small, smooth and linear changes of the PSF across the image.
Large numbers of stars spanning the region of interest
are necessary to compute an accurate model.
Users should only select the variable psf option if they are certain their
data conforms to the above model; they are prepared to spend considerable
time computing a good PSF; they are willing to invest the extra
computation time necessary to fit a variable PSF model to the stars.
The value of \fIvarpsf\fR in DAOPARS will be overridden by the value
stored in the PSF itself.
.le
.ls psfrad = 11.0 (scale units)
The radius of the circle in scale units within which the PSF is defined.
\fIPsfrad\fR should be somewhat larger than the radius at which the
intensity of the brightest star of interest fades into the noise.
\fIPsfrad\fR can never be larger than the value with which the
PSF was computed but may be smaller, in which case the value stored in
the PSF image header is overridden.
If the subtracted images of bright stars are surrounded
by bright halos \fIpsfrad\fR was too small. On the other hand a value of
\fIpsfrad\fR which is too large will uselessly consume CPU time
as the speed of the fitting process can be strong function of the psf
radius.
.le
.ls fitrad = 2.5 (scale units)
The fitting radius in scale units. Only pixels within the fitting radius of
the center of a star will
contribute to the fit computed by the PEAK, NSTAR and ALLSTAR tasks.
For most images the fitting radius
should be approximately equal to the FWHM of the PSF. Under severely
crowded conditions a somewhat smaller value may be chosen in order to improve
the fit. If the PSF is variable on the other hand,
it may be necessary to increase the fitting radius to achieve a good fit.
.le
.ls matchrad = 1.5 (scale units)
The tolerance in scale units for matching the stellar x and y centroids in the
photometry file with the image cursor position. \fIMatchrad\fR is currently
used by the PSF task to match stars shown on the image
display with stars in the photometry list.
.le
.ls critoverlap = 1.0
The ratio of the model intensity of a brighter star computed from
the scaled PSF at a distance of one fitting radius from the center
of the fainter star to the expected random error computed from the
readout noise, gain and value of the PSF. The critical overlap
parameter is used to group stars. In general if a small value such
as .1 divides all the stars in an image into groups less than
\fImaxgroup\fR, then the expected random errors will determine
the accuracy of the photometry. On the other hand if a value of
crtitcal overlap much greater than one is required to divide up the
stars crowding errors will dominate random errors. If a value of 1
is sufficient then crowding and random errors are roughly equivalent.
.le
.ls maxiter = 50
The maximum number of times that the PSF fitting tasks PEAK, NSTAR
and ALLSTAR will iterate on the fit before giving up.
.le
.ls maxgroup = 60
The maximum numbers of stars that the multiple star fitting tasks
NSTAR and ALLSTAR will fit simultaneously. NSTAR will simply refuse
to fit any groups large than \fImaxgroup\fR and set all the
output magnitudes of these stars to INDEF. ALLSTAR dynmacally regroups the stars
until the group is either \fImaxgroup\fR or smaller in size or becomes too
dense to
fit, in which case the magnitudes of unfitted stars are also set to INDEF.
.le
.ls maxnstar = 3000
The maximum number of stars which PEAK and ALLSTAR will process.
This should be set to a value somewhat larger than the
number of stars in the input photometry file.
.le
.ls recenter = yes (allstar only)
Compute new positions as well as magnitudes for all the stars in the
list.  PEAK and ALLSTAR always recompute new centers.
.le
.ls cliprange = 2.5, clipexp = 6.0 (allstar only)
The parameters of the weighting scheme in ALLSTAR used to resist bad data
by dynamically
reweighting bad pixels. For \fIclipexp\fR greater than 1 a
residual small compared to \fIcliprange\fR standard deviations
does not have its weight materially altered, one with exactly \fIcliprange\fR
standard deviations is given precisely half its normal weight, and
for large residuals the weight falls off as the standard deviation
to the minus \fIclipexp\fR power. For normal applications it is
strongly recommended that the user leave these numbers alone.

DESCRIPTION

DAOPARS is a simple parameter set which stores the DAOPHOT fitting parameters
required by all the DAOPHOT tasks which compute or fit the PSF.
Typing DAOPARS on the terminal will invoke the EPAR parameter editing
task. The DAOPARS parameters may be edited from within an EPAR command
to any task such as PSF which references them. These parameters may also
be changed on the command line in the usual manner during invocation of any
task which uses them.

Any given set of DAOPARS parameters may stored in a text file along with
the data being reduced by simply invoking the :w command from within the
EPAR task. If the user then sets the value of the \fIdaopars\fR parameter
in say the PSF task to the name of the file containing the stored
parameter set, the stored parameters will be used instead of the
default set in the user's uparam directory.

EXAMPLES

1. Print the DAOPARS task parameters.

.nf
    da> lpar daopars
.fi

2. Edit the DAOPARS parameters.

.nf
    da> epar daopars
.fi

3. Edit the DAOPARS parameters from with the PSF task.

.nf
    da> epar psf

	... edit a few psf parameters

	... move to the daopars parameter and type :e

	... edit the daopars parameters and type :q

	... finish editing the psf parametera and type ^Z
.fi

4. Save the current DAOPARS parameter set in a text file daonite1.par.
   This can also be done from inside a higher level task as in the
   above example.

.nf
    da> epar daopars

	... type ":w daonite1.par"  from within epar
.fi
