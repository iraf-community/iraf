NAME
pfmerge -- merge a list of photometry files
.ih
USAGE
pfmerge inphotfiles outphotfile
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls inphotfiles
The list of photometry files to be merged. Inphotfiles may be the output of the
DAOPHOT tasks PHOT, PSTSELECT, PSF, PEAK, GROUP, GRPSELECT, NSTAR, or ALLSTAR.
Inphotfiles may be either a list of APPHOT/DAOPHOT text databases or a list of
STSDAS binary tables.
.le
.ls outphotfile
The output photometry file. Outphotfile consists of the header of the first
input photometry file, followed by a list of records, one per input file
record, each consisting of five fields: ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MAG, and MSKY.
Outphotfile is a an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database if the first photometry file
is a text database, an STSDAS binary table if the first photometry file is an
ST table.

DESCRIPTION
PFMERGE creates a new photometry file suitable for input to PSF, PEAK, GROUP,
or ALLSTAR by extracting the header of the first input photometry file and the
values of the five fields: ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MAG, and MSKY from each
photometry record in each input file, and writing them to \fIoutphotfile\fR.
\fIInphotfiles\fR may be either APPHOT/DAOPHOT text databases or STSDAS binary
tables, but \fIoutphotfile\fR inherits the type of the first input photometry
file.

The principal application of PFMERGE is to combine the results of one of the
DAOPHOT fitting tasks, e.g. ALLSTAR, with the results of the aperture photometry
task PHOT, to create a new photometry file suitable for input to the fitting
task. e.g. ALLSTAR, since it if often the case that the user wishes to combine
preliminary results for a few additional stars with the best fit results to
date on the original star list. 

PFMERGE is intended to combine photometry files from different DAOPHOT tasks.
The task PCONCAT can be used to combine photometry files produced by the same
task.

EXAMPLES

1. Combine the results of the first allstar run with phot task results
on a small list of stars detected after the first list of stars was
subtracted from the original image.
