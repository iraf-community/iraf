.le
.ls groupfile
The list of input files, or directory, containing the group membership
information and initial estimates for the positions
and magnitudes of the stars to be measured.
If groupfile is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification

where ? is the highest existing version number. 
Otherise \fIgroupfile\fR must specify one photometry file for each input
image in \fIimage\fR.
\fIGroupfile\fR is usually

or an STSDAS table.
.le
.ls psfimage
The list of images, or directory, containing the PSF computed by
the DAOPHOT PSF task.
If psfimage is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification,
then NSTAR will look for an image with the name image.psf.? where
? is the highest existing version number.
Otherwise \fIpsfimage\fR must specify one PSF image for each input image.
.le
.ls nstarfile
The list of output photometry files.
If nstarfile is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification,

DESCRIPTION
NSTAR computes x and y centers and magnitudes for all the stellar groups
\fIgroupfile\fR, by fitting the PSF \fIpsfimage\fR
to the data in \fIimage\fR. NSTAR reads the group membership information
along with
initial estimates of the centers and magnitudes,
and the sky values from the photometry file \fIgroupfile\fR.
\fIGroupfile\fR is usually the output of the DAOPHOT GROUP task but
may also be the output of the PSF and NSTAR tasks.
The computed centers and magnitudes are written to \fInstarfile\fR
along with the sky values, the number of iterations it took to fit the
star, the goodness of fit statistic chi and the image sharpness statistic
sharp.
\fINstarfile\fR is text database if the DAOPHOT package parameter \fItext\fR
is "yes", an STSDAS table database if it is "no".

Only pixels within the good data range delimited by the DATAPARS task
parameters \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR are included in the fit.
Most users set \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR so as
to exclude pixels outside the linearity regime of the detector.
By default all the data is fit.
Users are advised to determine accurate values for these parameters
and set the appropriate parameters in DATAPARS before beginning any DAOPHOT
reductions.

Only pixels within the fitting radius
\fIfitrad\fR / \fIscale\fR are included in the fit for each star.
\fIFitrad\fR is located in the DAOPARS task and \fIscale\fR is located
in the DATAPARS task.
Since the non-linear least-squares
fitting algorithm determines three unknowns, the x and y position of the
star's centroid
and its brightness, the value of \fIfitrad\fR must be sufficiently
large to include at least three pixels in the fit for each star.
To accelerate the convergence of the non-linear least-squares fitting
algorithm pixels within \fIfitrad\fR are assigned weights which
are  inversely proportional to the radial distance of the pixel from the x and
y centroid of the star, falling from a maximum at the centroid
to zero at the fitting radius. \fIFitrad\fR must be sufficiently large
to include at least three pixels with non-zero weights in the fit for each
star.  Values of \fIfitrad\fR close to the full-width at half-maxima of the
PSF are recommended. In actual fact NSTAR imposes a minimum number of pixel
limit of four.

NSTAR performs a weighted fit to the PSF. The weight of each pixel
is computed by combining the radial weighting function described above
with weights derived from the random errors NSTAR expects based on the
values of the DATAPARS parameters \fIreadnoise\fR and \fIepadu\fR
specified by the user. To obtain optimal fits,
users are strongly advised to determine those parameters accurately 
and to enter their values in DATAPARS before beginning any DAOPHOT
reductions.

For each group of stars to be fit, NSTAR extracts a subraster
from \fIimage\fR which extends approximately
\fIpsfrad\fR / \fIscale\fR + 1 pixels wide past the limiting values of the
x and y coordinates
of the stars in the group. \fIPsfrad\fR
is the PSF radius specified in the DAOPARS task, and \fIscale\fR is the
image scale specified by the DATAPARS task. \fIPsfrad\fR may
be less than or equal to but can never exceed the value of the image header
parameter "PSFRAD" in \fIpsfimage\fR.
\fIPsfrad\fR should always be several pixels larger
than \fIfitrad\fR to permit the x and y centroids to wander during the
fitting process.

As well as the computed x and y centers and magnitudes, NSTAR outputs
the number of times the PSF fit had to be iterated before reaching
convergence. The
minimum number of iterations is four. The maximum
number of iteration permitted is specified by the 
\fImaxiter\fR parameter in the DAOPARS task.
Obviously the results for stars which
have reached the maximum iteration count should be viewed with 
suspicion. However since the convergenge criteria are quite strict,
(the computed magnitude must change  by less than .001 magnitudes or
0.05 sigma whichever is larger, and the x and y centroids must change
by less than 0.01 pixels from one iteration to the next), even
these stars may be reasonably well measured. It must be emphasized
that every star in the group must individually satisfy the convergence
criteria in order for the group to be considered adequately reduced.

NSTAR computes a goodnes of fit statistic chi which is essentially the
ratio of the observed pixel-to-pixel scatter in the fitting residuals
to the expected scatter. Since the expected scatter is dependent
on the DATAPARS task parameters \fIreadnoise\fR and \fIepadu\fR,
it is important for these values to be set correctly.
A plot of chi versus magnitude should scatter around
unity with little or no trend in chi with magnitude, except at the
bright end where saturation effects may be present.

Finally NSTAR computes the statistic sharp which estimates the intrinsic
angular size of the measured object outside the atmosphere.
Sharp is roughly defined as the difference between the square of the
width of the object and the square of the width of PSF.
Sharp has values close to zero for single stars, large positive values
for blended doubles and partially resolved galaxies and large
negative values for cosmic rays and blemishes.

NSTAR contains a highly sophisticated star rejection algorithm. First of
all, any group of stars which is more than a certain size
is simply not fit. The maximum group size is sepcified by the
\fImaxgroup\fR parameter in the DAOPARS task. Larger groups may run
into numerical precision problems during the fits. Users should exercise
care in experimenting with changing the \fImaxgroup\fR parameter.
If two stars in a group
have centroids separated by a crtical distance, currently set arbitrarily
to 0.37 * the FWHM of the stellar core, their photocentric position
and combined magnitude is assigned to the brighter of the two stars,  and the
fainter is eliminated. Any star which converges to 12.5 magnitudes
greater than the magnitude of the PSF is considered to be non-existent
and eliminated from the group.

After iterations 4 to 7, if the faintest star in the group has a 
brightness less than one sigma above zero, it is eliminated.
After iterations 8 to 11, if the faintest star in the group has a brightness
less than 1.5 sigma above zero, it is eliminated. After iterations 12 to
50 or whenever the solutions has converged whichever comes first,
if the faintest star in the group has a brightness less than 2.0 sigma
above zero, it is eliminated.
Before iterations 4 to 7, 8 to 11 and 12 to 50, if two stars are separated
by more than 0.37 * FWHM and less than 1.0 * FWHM and if the fainter
of the two is more uncertain than 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 sigma respectively
the fainter one is eliminated.

Whenever a star is eliminated the iteration counter is backed up by
one and reduction proceeds with a smaller set of stars. Backing up
the counter gives the second least certain star in the group 
two iterations to settle into a new fit before its fate is decided.
The star rejection algorithm depends upon the DATAPARS \fIreadnoise\fR
and \fIgain\fR parameters. Therefore these parameters should be
set to reasonable values before running NSTAR.

NSTAR operates in a very similar manner to PEAK. However because it
fits groups of stars simultaneously it is much more
accurate than PEAK in crowded regions. The ALLSTAR task also
fits groups of stars simultaneously, both  grouping the stars dynamically
as well as producing a subtracted image. Essentially it replaces
GROUP, GRPSELECT, NSTAR and SUBSTAR. However the user has little control
over the grouping process and does not know at the end which stars were
actually fit together. NSTAR is the task of choice when a user wants to
maintain rigorous control over the composition of the stellar groups.

EXAMPLES

1. Fit the PSF to a list stars in a crowded field near M92.
After the fit subtract the fitted stars from the image.

.nf
    da> nstar m92 m92.grp.1 m92.psf.1 default verb+ veri+
    da> substar m92 m92.nst.1 m92.psf.1 default veri-
.fi

2. Run NSTAR exactly as in example 1 but submit the task to the background
saving all the verbose output in a file called nstar.out.

.nf
    da> nstar m92 m92.grp.1 m92.psf.1 default verb+ veri- > nstar.out & 
.fi

3. Run NSTAR exactly as in example 1, remove all the stars with INDEF
valued magnitudes from the output and rerun NSTAR.

.nf
    da> nstar m92 m92.grp.1 m92.psf.1 default verb+ veri+
    da> select m92.nst.1 m92.nst.2 "MAG != INDEF"
    da> nstar m92 m92.nst.2 m92.psf.1 default verb+ veri+
