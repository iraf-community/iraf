NAME
addstar -- add artificial stars to images
.ih
USAGE
addstar image starlist psfimage addimage
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images to which the artificial stars are to be added.
.le
.ls starlist
The list of files containing the x and y coordinates and magnitudes of the
artificial stars to be added. If \fIstarlist\fR is null ("") then
\fInstar\fR artificial stars uniformly distributed in position and in magnitude
between \fIminmag\fR and \fImaxmag\fR are added to the input image.
Otherwise \fIstarlist\fR must specify one coordinate file for each image
in \fIimage\fR.
\fIStarlist\fR may be either a simple text file conaining x, y, and mag in
columns 1, 2 and 3 respectively (\fIsimple_text\fR = yes), an APPHOT/DAOPHOT
text database or an STSDAS table.
.le
.ls psfimage
The list of PSF images created by the DAOPHOT PSF task. If \fIpsfimage\fR
is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification, then ADDSTAR
will look for a file with the name image.psf.?, where ? is the highest
existing version number. Otherwise \fIpsfimage\fR must specify one PSF
image for every image in \fIimage\fR.
.le
.ls addimage
The root name of output image with the artificial stars added.
If \fIaddimage\fR is "default", "dir$default" or a directory specification,
then an output image and artificial star list called image.add.? and
image.art.? respectively are written, where ? is the next available version
number. Otherwise an image called addimage
and the artificial starlist called \fIaddimage\fR are written.
If the DAOPHOT  package parameter \fItext\fR is "yes" then an APPHOT/DAOPHOT
text database is written, otherwise an STSDAS table is written.
.le
.ls datapars = ""
The text file in which the data dependent parameters are stored.
If \fIdatapars\fR is null ("") then the default parameter set in the
user's uparm directory will be used.
.le
.ls daopars = ""
The text file in which the daophot fitting parameters are stored.
If \fIdaopars\fR is null ("") then the default parameter set in the
user's uparm directory will be used.
.le
.ls minmag
The minimum magnitude of the computer generated artificial stars to be
added to the image. The actual intensities of the pixels in the artificial
stars are computed with respect to the magnitude of the PSF stored in
\fIpsfimage\fR.
.le
.ls maxmag
The maximum magnitude of the computer generated artificial stars to be
added to the image. The actual intensities of the pixels in the artificial
stars are computed with respect to the magnitude of the PSF stored in
\fIpsfimage\fR.
.le
.ls nstar
The number of computer generated artificial stars to be added to the input
image.
.le
.ls idoffset = 0
The integer offset to be added to the id numbers of stars in the output
artificial starlist. By default the stars are numbered from 1 to N where
N is the number of artifical stars added to the input frame.
.le
.ls nimage = 1
The number of output images created per input image.
.le
.ls simple_text = no
If \fIstarlist\fR is a text file and \fIsimple_text\fR = "no", then
ADDSTAR expects an APPHOT/DAOPHOT database. Otherwise ADDSTAR expects
a simple list format with x, y and magnitude in columns 1, 2 and 3
respectively.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print messages about the progress of the task?
.le
.ls verify = yes
Verify the critical ADDSTAR task parameters?
.le
.ls update = no
Update the critical ADDSTAR task parameters if \fIverify\fR = "yes"?
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
ADDSTAR adds artificial stars from the \fIstarlist\fR or generated at random
by the computer using the PSF in \fIpsfimage\fR to the input image \fIimage\fR
and writes the result to the output image and list specified by
\fIaddimage\fR. The starlist
may be an STSDAS table database, an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database or a simple
text file with the x and y positions and magnitude in columns 1, 2 and 3
respectively. The ids of stars in the output list may be set to numbers
outside the range of the real data by setting the parameter \fIoffset\fR.
Several output images may be written for each input image
by setting \fInimage\fR greater than 1.

If \fIstarlist\fR is null ("") then the computer will generate an
articial starlist containing \fInstar\fR stars uniformly distributed
in position over the image and in magnitude between \fIminmag\fR
and \fImaxmag\fR.

Users should be sure to specify the correct value of \fIepadu\fR in
the DATAPARS task so that Poisson noise in the stars can be correctly
added to the image.

EXAMPLES
1. Add 30 stars uniformly distributed between 17 and 20th magnitude and
in position to the input image m92.

.nf
    da> addstar m92 "" m92.psf.1 "default" 17.0 20.0 30 
.fi

2. Add the articifial stars in the simple list file artdata to the same image.

.nf
    da> addstar m92 artdata  m92.psf.1 "default" simple+
.fi
