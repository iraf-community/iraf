NAME
daotest -- run basic tests on the daophot package tasks
.ih
USAGE
daotest imname
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls imname
The root name of the output test images. The input test image is stored in
fits format in the DAOPHOT package test directory. If the image already exists
DAOTEST will exit with a warning message.
.le
.ls daologfile = ""
The name of the output log file. By default all the output image header
listings and photometry file output is logged in a file
called \fI"imname.log"\fR. If the log file already exists DAOTEST will
exit with a warning message.
.le
.ls daoplotfile = ""
The name of the output plot file. By default all the graphics output is
logged in a file called \fI"imname.plot"\fR. If the plot file already exists
DAOTEST will exit with a warning message.

DESCRIPTION
DAOTEST is a simple script which exercises each of the major tasks in the
DAOPHOT package in turn. At startup DAOTEST reads a small fits image stored
in the DAOPHOT test subdirectory and creates the image \fIimname\fR in
the user's working directory. DAOTEST initializes the DAOPHOT package by
returning
all the parameters to their default state, runs each of the DAOPHOT
tasks in non-interactive mode, spools the text output to the file
\fIdaologfile\fR, the graphics output from the PSF task to the plot
metacode file \fIapplotfile\fR, and the image output from PSF, SUBSTAR
and ADDSTAR to \fIimname.psf.1\fR, \fIimname.sub.1\fR, and \fIimname.add.1\fR
respectively.

EXAMPLES

1. Check to see that all the DAOPHOT tasks are functioning correctly.
.nf
	da> daophot

	... load the daophot package

	da> daotest testim

	... run the test script

	da> lprint testim.log

	... print the text output

	da> gkidir testim.plot

	... list the contents of the plot file

	da> gkiextract testim.plot 1-N | stdplot

	... send the plots to the plotter

	da> display testim 1

	... display the original image

	da> surface testim.psf.1

	... make a surface plot of the psf look-up table

	da> display testim.sub.1 1

	... display the image with all the stars fitted by ALLSTAR
	    subtracted out

	da> display testim.add.1 1

	... display the image  containing three additional artificial
