.ih
USAGE
phot image coords output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images containing the objects to be measured.
.le
.ls coords
The list of text files containing initial coordinates for the objects to
be centered. Objects are listed in coords one object per line with the
initial coordinate values in columns one and two. The number of coordinate
files must be zero, one, or equal to the number of images.  If coords is
"default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then a coords file name
of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed and searched for,
where dir is the directory, root is the root image name, extension is "coo"
and version is the highest available version number for the file.
.le
.ls output
The name of the results file or results directory. If output is
"default", "dir$default", or a directory specification then an output file name
of the form dir$root.extension.version is constructed, where dir is the
directory, root is the root image name, extension is "mag" and version is
the next available version number for the file. The number of output files
must be zero, one, or equal to the number of image files.  In both interactive
and batch mode full output is written to output. In interactive mode
an output summary is also written to the standard output.
.le
.ls skyfile = ""
The list of text files containing the sky values, of the measured objects,
one object per line with x, y, the sky value, sky sigma, sky skew, number of sky
pixels and number of rejected sky pixels in columns one to seven respectively.
The number of sky files must be zero, one, or equal to the number of input
images. A skyfile value is only requested if \fIfitskypars.salgorithm\fR =
"file" and if PHOT is run non-interactively.
.le
.ls plotfile = ""
The name of the file containing radial profile plots of the stars written
to the output file. If plotfile is defined then a radial profile plot
is written to plotfile every time a record is written to \fIoutput\fR.
The user should be aware that this can be a time consuming operation.
.le
.ls datapars = ""
The name of the file containing the data dependent parameters. The critical
parameters \fIfwhmpsf\fR and \fIsigma\fR are located here. If \fIdatapars\fR
is undefined then the default parameter set in uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls centerpars = ""
The name of the file containing the centering parameters. The critical
parameters \fIcalgorithm\fR and \fIcbox\fR are located here.
If \fIcenterpars\fR is undefined then the default parameter set in
uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls fitskypars = ""
The name of the text file containing the sky fitting parameters. The critical
parameters \fIsalgorithm\fR, \fIannulus\fR, and \fIdannulus\fR are located here.
If \fIfitskypars\fR is undefined then the default parameter set in uparm
directory is used.
.le
.ls photpars = ""
The name of the file containing the photometry parameters. The critical
parameter \fIapertures\fR is located here.  If \fIphotpars\fR is undefined
then the default parameter set in uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls interactive = no
Run the task interactively ?
.le
.ls radplots = no
If \fIradplots\fR is "yes" and PHOT is run in interactive mode, a radial
profile of each star is plotted on the screen after the star is measured.
.le
.ls icommands = ""
The image display cursor or image cursor command file.
.le
.ls gcommands = ""
The graphics cursor or graphics cursor command file.
.le
.ls wcsin = ")_.wcsin", wcsout = ")_.wcsout"
The coordinate system of the input coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR and
of the output coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR respectively. The image
header coordinate system is used to transform from the input coordinate
system to the "logical" pixel coordinate system used internally,
and from the internal "logical" pixel coordinate system to the output
coordinate system. The input coordinate system options are "logical", "tv",
"physical", and "world". The output coordinate system options are "logical",
"tv", and "physical". The image cursor coordinate system is assumed to
be the "tv" system.
.ls logical
Logical coordinates are pixel coordinates relative to the current image.
The  logical coordinate system is the coordinate system used by the image
input/output routines to access the image data on disk. In the logical
coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a  2D image, e.g.
dev$ypix  and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are
always (1,1).
.le
.ls tv
Tv coordinates are the pixel coordinates used by the display servers. Tv
coordinates  include  the effects of any input image section, but do not
include the effects of previous linear transformations. If the input
image name does not include an image section, then tv coordinates are
identical to logical coordinates.  If the input image name does include a
section, and the input image has not been linearly transformed or copied from
a parent image, tv coordinates are identical to physical coordinates.
In the tv coordinate system the coordinates of the first pixel of a
2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300]
are (1,1) and (200,200) respectively.
.le
.ls physical
Physical coordinates are pixel coordinates invariant  with respect to linear
transformations of the physical image data.  For example, if the current image
was created by extracting a section of another image,  the  physical
coordinates of an object in the current image will be equal to the physical
coordinates of the same object in the parent image,  although the logical
coordinates will be different.  In the physical coordinate system the
coordinates of the first pixel of a 2D image, e.g. dev$ypix and a 2D
image section, e.g. dev$ypix[200:300,200:300] are (1,1) and (200,200)
respectively.
.le
.ls world
World coordinates are image coordinates in any units which are invariant
with respect to linear transformations of the physical image data. For
example, the ra and dec of an object will always be the same no matter
how the image is linearly transformed. The units of input world coordinates
must be the same as those expected by the image header wcs, e. g.
degrees and degrees for celestial coordinate systems.
.le
The wcsin and wcsout parameters default to the values of the package
parameters of the same name. The default values of the package parameters
wcsin and wcsout are "logical" and "logical" respectively.
.le
.ls cache = ")_.cache"
Cache the image pixels in memory. Cache may be set to the value of the apphot
package parameter (the default), "yes", or "no". By default caching is
disabled.
.le
.ls verify = ")_.verify"
Verify the critical PHOT parameters in non-interactive mode ? Verify can be set
to the DAOPHOT package parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls update = ")_.update"
Update the algorithm parameter values if \fIverify\fR is "yes" and
\fIinteractive\fR is "no" ?  Update can be set to the DAOPHOT package parameter
value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls verbose = ")_.verbose"
Print results on the screen in non-interactive mode ?  Verbose can be set to
the DAOPHOT package parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls graphics = ")_.stdgraph"
The default graphics device. Graphics may be set to the DAOPHOT package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".
.le
.ls display = ")_.display"
The default display device.  Display may be set to the DAOPHOT package
parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no". By default graphics overlay is
disabled.  Setting display to one of "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" enables
graphics overlay with the IMD graphics kernel.  Setting display to "stdgraph"
enables PHOT to work interactively from a contour plot.

DESCRIPTION

PHOT computes accurate centers, sky values, and magnitudes for a list of
objects in the IRAF image \fIimage\fR whose coordinates are read from
the text file \fIcoords\fR or the image display cursor, and writes the
computed x and y coordinates, sky values, and magnitudes to the text
file \fIoutput\fR.

The coordinates read from \fIcoords\fR are assumed to be in coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsin\fR. The options are "logical", "tv", "physical",
and "world" and the transformation from the input coordinate system to
the internal "logical" system is defined by the image coordinate system.
The simplest default is the "logical" pixel system. Users working on with
image sections but importing pixel coordinate lists generated from the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" input coordinate systems.
Users importing coordinate lists in world coordinates, e.g. ra and dec,
must use the "world" coordinate system and may need to convert their
equatorial coordinate units from hours and degrees to degrees and degrees first.

The coordinates written to \fIoutput\fR are in the coordinate
system defined by \fIwcsout\fR. The options are "logical", "tv",
and "physical". The simplest default is the "logical" system. Users
wishing to correlate the output coordinates of objects measured in
image sections or mosaic pieces with coordinates in the parent
image must use the "tv" or "physical" coordinate systems.

In interactive mode the user may either define the list of objects to be
measured interactively with the image cursor or create an object list prior
to running PHOT. In either case the user may adjust the centering, sky fitting,
 and photometry algorithm parameters until a satisfactory fit is achieved
and optionally store the final results in \fIoutput\fR. In batch mode the
initial positions are read from the text file \fIcoords\fR or the image
cursor parameter \fIicommands\fR can be redirected to a text file containing
a list of cursor commands. In batch mode the current set of algorithm
parameters is used.

If \fIcache\fR is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If caching
is enabled and PHOT is run interactively the first measurement will appear
to take a long time as the entire image must be read in before the measurement
is actually made. All subsequent measurements will be very fast because PHOT
is accessing memory not disk. The point of caching is to speed up random
image access by making the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the
image itself. However if the input object lists are sorted in row order and
sparse caching may actually worsen not improve the execution time. Also at
present there is no point in enabling caching for images that are less than
or equal to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the
default image i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix
is doubled by converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the
effect of caching in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements
of objects in the top and bottom halves of the image are alternated.


PHOT computes accurate centers for each object using the centering
parameters defined in \fIcenterpars\fR, computes an accurate sky value
for each object using the sky fitting parameters defined in \fIfitskypars\fR,
 and computes magnitudes using the photometry parameters defined in
\fIphotpars\fR. The image data characteristics of the data are specified
in \fIdatapars\fR.

Unlike the APPHOT versions of PHOT the DAOPHOT version of PHOT does NOT
recenter the stars, as the default input coordinate list is created
by the DAOFIND task which itself computes accurate centers for the stars.
DAOPHOT users should set the CENTERPARS task parameter \fIcalgorithm\fR
to "centroid" if they need to measure stars interactively with the
image display and image display cursor. The PHOT tasks centers provide
initial guesses for the PSF modeling and fitting routines in the PSF,
PEAK, NSTAR, and ALLSTAR tasks.

The DAOPHOT version of PHOT sets the sky fitting algorithm to  "mode".
This algorithm which uses the mean and median to estimate the value
that the sky would have if the star of interest wasn't there, is in most
cases the one which will give the best results in crowded fields.  Users
interested in reducing small stellar groups should realizes that they can,
fix the sky by setting the FITSKYPARS parameter \fIsalgorithm\fR to "constant"
and setting \fIskyvalue\fR to the desired sky value, or set the sky
interactively using the "radplot" or "histplot" options.  Users with rapidly
varying sky backgrounds may wish to explore the "median" or "centroid" sky
fitting algorithm which can be more stable than the "mode" algorithm
against complex sky pixel histograms.  Users with very few counts in their
data or with quantized data where the standard deviation is small with
respect to the quantization level may wish to explore the "mean",
and "centroid"  sky fitting algorithms.

The PHOT task sets the instrumental magnitude scale for all the subsequent
DAOPHOT tasks. Users should be sure they have set the PHOTPARS \fIapertures\fR
parameter to a reasonable value, and that they have accounted for the
exposure time by setting either the DATAPARS \fIexposure\fR or \fIitime\fR
parameters.

ALGORITHMS

A brief description of the data dependent parameters, centering algorithms,
sky fitting algorithms and photometry parameters can be found in the
online help pages for the DATAPARS, CENTERPARS, FITSKYPARS, and PHOTPARS
tasks.

.ih
OUTPUT

In interactive mode the following quantities are printed on the standard
output as each object is measured. Err is a simple string indicating whether
or not an error was detected in the centering algorithm, the sky fitting
algorithm or the photometry algorithm. Mag are the magnitudes in apertures 1
through N respectively and xcenter, ycenter and msky are the x and y centers
and the sky value respectively.

.nf
    image  xcenter  ycenter  msky  mag[1 ... N]  error
.fi

In both interactive and batch mode full output is written to the text file
\fIoutput\fR. At the beginning of each file is a header listing the
current values of the parameters when the first stellar record was written.
These parameters can be subsequently altered. For each star measured the
following record is written

.nf
	image  xinit  yinit  id  coords  lid
	   xcenter  ycenter  xshift  yshift  xerr  yerr  cier error
	   msky  stdev  sskew  nsky  nsrej  sier  serror
	   itime  xairmass  ifilter  otime
	   rapert  sum  area  mag  merr  pier  perr
.fi

Image and coords are the name of the image and coordinate file respectively.
Id and lid are the sequence numbers of stars in the output and coordinate
files respectively. Cier and cerror are the centering algorithm error code
and accompanying error message respectively.  Xinit, yinit, xcenter, ycenter,
xshift, yshift, and xerr, yerr are self explanatory and output in pixel units.
The sense of the xshift and yshift definitions is the following.


.nf
	xshift = xcenter - xinit
	yshift = ycenter - yinit
.fi

Sier and serror are the sky fitting error code and accompanying error
message respectively. Msky, stdev and sskew are the best estimate of the sky
value (per pixel), standard deviation and skew respectively. Nsky and nsrej
are the number of sky pixels and the number of sky pixels rejected respectively.

Itime is the exposure time, xairmass is self-evident, ifilter is an
id string identifying the filter used in the observations, and otime is
a string containing the time of the observation in whatever units the
user has set up.

Rapert, sum, area, and flux  are the radius of the aperture in scale units,
the total number of counts including sky in the aperture, the area of the
aperture in square pixels, and the total number of counts excluding sky
in the aperture. Mag and merr are the magnitude and error in the magnitude
in the aperture (see below).

.nf
        flux = sum - area * msky
         mag = zmag - 2.5 * log10 (flux) + 2.5 * log10 (itime)
        merr = 1.0857 * err / flux
         err = sqrt (flux / epadu + area * stdev**2 +
               area**2 * stdev**2 / nsky)
.fi

Pier and perror are photometry error code and accompanying error message.

In interactive mode a radial profile of each measured object is plotted
in the graphics window if \fIradplots\fR is "yes".

In interactive and batchmode a radial profile plot is written to
\fIplotfile\fR  if it is defined each time the result of an object
measurement is written to \fIoutput\fR .


.ih
ERRORS

If the object centering was error free then the field cier will be zero.
Non-zero values of cier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0        # No error
	101      # The centering box is off image
	102      # The centering box is partially off the image
	103      # The S/N ratio is low in the centering box
	104      # There are two few points for a good fit
	105      # The x or y center fit is singular
	106      # The x or y center fit did not converge
	107      # The x or y center shift is greater than maxshift
	108      # There is bad data in the centering box
.fi

If all goes well during the sky fitting process then the error code sier
will be 0. Non-zero values of sier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0         # No error
	201       # There are no sky pixels in the sky annulus
	202       # Sky annulus is partially off the image
	203       # The histogram of sky pixels has no width
	204       # The histogram of sky pixels is flat or concave
	205       # There are too few points for a good sky fit
	206       # The sky fit is singular
	207       # The sky fit did not converge
	208       # The graphics stream is undefined
	209       # The file of sky values does not exist
	210       # The sky file is at EOF
	211       # Cannot read the sky value correctly
	212       # The best fit parameter are non-physical
.fi

If no error occurs during the measurement of the magnitudes then pier is
0. Non-zero values of pier flag the following error conditions.
 
.nf
	 0        # No error
	 301      # The aperture is off the image
	 302      # The aperture is partially off the image
	 303      # The sky value is undefined
	 305      # There is bad data in the aperture

EXAMPLES

1. Run PHOT on the image dev$ypix using the coordinate list ypix.coo.1
created by DAOFIND and the default setup.

users who have access to a graphics terminal but not to an image display
server. Setup the task parameters using the interactive setup menu defined by
the i key command as in example 1.

            stellar radial profile plot
        ... typing <CR> leaves everything at the default value
        ... type q to quit the setup menu

        ... type the v key to verify the critical parameters

        ... type the w key to save the parameters in the parameter files

        ... move the graphics cursor to the stars of interest and tap
            the space bar

        ... a one line summary of the fitted parameters will appear on the
            standard output for each star measured

        ... type q to quit and q again to verify

        ... full output will appear in the text file ypix.mag.3

        da> set stdimcur = <default>

        ... reset stdimcur to its previous value
.fi


4. Setup and run PHOT interactively on a list of objects temporarily
overriding the fwhmpsf, sigma, cbox, annulus, dannulus, and apertures
parameters determined in examples 1 or 2.

.nf

	da> display dev$ypix 1

	    ... display the image

        da> phot dev$ypix ypix.coo.1 default calgorithm="centroid" \

            interactive+

        ... type ? for optional help


        ... move the graphics cursor to the stars and tap space bar

                                or

        ... select stars from the input coordinate list with m / :m #
            and measure with spbar

        ... measure stars selected from the input coordinate list
            with n / n #

        ... a one line summary of results will appear on the standard output
            for each star measured

        ... type q to quit and q again to confirm the quit

        ... the output will appear in ypix.mag.4 ...
.fi


5. Display and measure some stars in an image section and write the output
coordinates in the coordinate system of the parent image.

.nf
        da> display dev$ypix[150:450,150:450] 1

        ... display the image section

        da> phot dev$ypix[150:450,150:450] "" default wcsout=tv \
            calgorithm="centroid" interactive+

        ... move cursor to stars and type spbar

        ... type q to quit and q again to confirm quit

        ... output will appear in ypix.mag.5

        da> pdump ypix.mag.5 xc,yc yes | tvmark 1 STDIN col=204
.fi


6. Run PHOT in batch mode using the coordinate file and the previously
saved parameters. Verify the critical parameters.

.nf
        ap> phot dev$ypix default default 

        ... output will appear in ypix.mag.6...
.fi


7. Repeat example 6 but assume that the input coordinate are ra and dec
in degrees and degrees, turn off verification, and submit the task to to
the background.

.nf
        da> display dev$ypix 1

        ap> rimcursor wcs=world > radec.coo

        ... move to selected stars and type any key

        ... type ^Z to quit

        da> phot dev$ypix radec.coo default wcsin=world verify- verbose- &

        ... output will appear in ypix.mag.7

        da> pdump ypix.mag.7 xc,yc yes | tvmark 1 STDIN col=204

        ... mark the stars on the display
.fi


8. Run PHOT interactively without using the image display cursor.

.nf
        da> show stdimcur

        ... record the default value of stdimcur

        da> set stdimcur = text

        ... set the image cursor to the standard input

        da> phot dev$ypix default default interactive+ 

        ... type ? for optional help

        ... type :m 3 to set the initial coordinates to those of the
            third star in the list

        ... type i to enter the interactive setup menu
        ... enter the maximum radius in pixels for the radial profile or
            accept the default with a CR
        ... type v to enter the default menu
        ... set the fwhmpsf, centering radius, inner and outer sky annuli,
            apertures, and sigma using the graphics cursor and the
            stellar radial profile plot
        ... typing <CR> after the prompt leaves the parameter at its default
            value
        ... type q to quit the setup menu

        ... type r to rewind the coordinate list

        ... type l to measure all the stars in the coordinate list

        ... a one line summary of the answers will appear on the standard
            output for each star measured

        ... type q to quit followed by q to confirm the quit

        ... full output will appear in the text file ypix.mag.8

        da> set stdimcur = <default>

        ... reset the value of stdimcur

.fi

8. Use a image cursor command file to drive the PHOT task. The cursor command
file shown below sets the cbox, annulus, dannulus, and apertures parameters
computes the centers, sky values, and magnitudes for 3 stars, updates the
parameter files, and quits the task.

.nf
        da> type cmdfile
	: calgorithm centroid
        : cbox 9.0
        : annulus 12.0
        : dannulus 5.0
        : apertures 5.0
        442 410 101 \040
        349 188 101 \040
        225 131 101 \040
        w
        q

        da> phot dev$ypix "" default icommands=cmdfile  verify-

        ... full output will appear in ypix.mag.9
.fi

BUGS

It is currently the responsibility of the user to make sure that the
image displayed in the frame is the same as that specified by the image
parameter.

Commands which draw to the image display are disabled by default.
To enable graphics overlay on the image display, set the display
parameter to "imdr", "imdg", "imdb", or "imdy" to get red, green,
blue or yellow overlays and set the centerpars mkcenter switch to
"yes", the fitskypars mksky switch to"yes", or the photpars mkapert
switch to "yes". It may be necessary to run gflush and to redisplay the image
to get the overlays position correctly.
