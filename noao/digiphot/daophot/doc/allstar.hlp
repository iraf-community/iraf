.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls image
The list of images containing the stars to be fit
.le
.ls photfile
The input photometry file list or directory containing the
initial estimates of the positions, sky values,
and magnitudes of the stars to be fit.
If \fIphotfile\fR is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification,
then ALLSTAR looks for a file with the name image.mag.?
where ? is the highest existing version number.  Otherwise \fIphotfile\fR
must specify one photometry file for every image in \fIimage\fR.
\fIPhotfile\fR is usually
the output of the DAOPHOT PHOT task but may also be the output of the
PSF, PEAK and NSTAR tasks, or the ALLSTAR task itself.
.le
.ls psfimage
The list of images or directory containing the PSF computed by
the DAOPHOT PSF task.
If psfimage is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification,
then ALLSTAR will look for an image with the name image.psf.? where
? is the highest existing version number. Otherwise \fIpsfimage\fR must
specify one PSF image for every image in \fIimage\fR.
.le
.ls allstarfile
The list of output photometry files.
If \fIallstarfile\fR is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification
then ALLSTAR will write an output file with the name image.als.?
where ? is the next available version number.
Otherwise \fIallstarfile\fR must specify one output photometry file
for every image in \fIimage\fR.
\fIAllstarfile\fR is a text database if the DAOPHOT package parameter \fItext\fR
is "yes", an STSDAS table database if it is "no".
.le
.ls rejfile
The list of output rejected photometry files.
If \fIrejfile\fR is null (""), results for all the stars in \fIphotfile\fR
are written to \fIallstarfile\fR, otherwise only the stars which were
successfully fit are written to \fIallstarfile\fR and the remainder
are written to \fIrejfile\fR.
If \fIrejfile\fR is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification
then ALLSTAR will write an output file with the name image.arj.?
where ? is the next available version number.
Otherwise \fIrejfile\fR must specify one output photometry file
for every image in \fIimage\fR.
\fIRejfile\fR is a text database if the DAOPHOT package parameter \fItext\fR
is "yes", an STSDAS table database if it is "no".
.le
.ls subimage
The list of output images or directory containing the data with the
fitted stars subtracted.
If subimage is "default", "dir$default", or a directory specification,
then ALLSTAR will create an image with the name image.sub.? where
? is the next available version number. Otherwise \fIsubimage\fR must
specify one output image for every image in \fIimage\fR.
.le
.ls cache = yes
Cache all the data in memory ?
If \fIcache\fR is "yes", then ALLSTAR
attempts to preallocate sufficient space to store the input image plus
the two image-sized working
arrays it requires, plus space for the starlist, in memory. This can
significantly reduce the total execution time. Users should
however beware of creating a situation where excessive paging occurs.
If \fIcache\fR = "no", ALLSTAR operates on subrasters
containing the group currently being reduced, and writes the intermediate
results to temporary scratch images. This option will
work on any-sized image (unless a single group becomes the size of the
entire image!) but can become slow of there are a large number of
disk accesses. Users may wish to experiment to see which mode
of operation suits their system best.
.le
.ls datapars = ""
The name of the file containing the DAOPHOT data dependent parameters.
If \fIdatapars\fR is null ("") then the default parameter set in the user's
uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls daopars = ""
The name of the file containing the DAOPHOT fitting parameters.
If \fIdaopars\fR is null ("") then the default parameter set in the user's
uparm directory is used.
.le
.ls verbose = ")_.verbose"
Print messages about the progress of the task. \fIVerbose\fR can be set
to the daophot package parameter value (the default), "yes", or "no".

Update the critical ALLSTAR task parameters if \fIverify\fR = "yes".
\fIUpdate\fR can be set to the daophot package parameter value
(the default), "yes", or "no".

DESCRIPTION

ALLSTAR computes x and y centers, sky values, and magnitudes for the
stars in \fIphotfile\fR
by fitting the PSF \fIpsfimage\fR to groups of stars in the IRAF image   
\fIimage\fR.
Initial estimates of the centers, sky values, and magnitudes,
are read from the photometry list \fIphotfile\fR.
ALLSTAR groups the stars dynamically, performing a regrouping
operation after every iteration.
The new computed centers, sky values, and magnitudes are written
to \fIallstarfile\fR
along with the number of iterations it took to fit the
star, the goodness of fit statistic chi, and the image sharpness statistic
sharp.
If \fIrejfile\fR is not null (""), only stars that are successfully fit
are written to \fIallstarfile\fR, and the remainder are written to
\fIrejfile\fR. Otherwise all the stars are written to \fIallstarfile\fR.
\fIAllstarfile\fR and \fIrejfile\fR are text databases if the DAOPHOT
package parameter \fItext\fR
is "yes", STSDAS table databases if it is "no".
An image with all the fitted stars subtracted out is written to \fIsubimage\fR.
In effect ALLSTAR performs the combined operations of GROUP,
GRPSELECT, NSTAR,  and SUBSTAR.

By default ALLSTAR computes new centers for all the stars
in \fIphotfile\fR. However if the DAOPARS parameter \fIrecenter\fR
is "no", ALLSTAR assumes that the x and y centers in \fIphotfile\fR
are the true centers and does not refit them. This option can be quite useful
in cases
where accurate center values have been derived from an image that has been
through some non-linear image restoration algorithm, but the photometry
must be derived from the original unrestored image.

By default (\fIgroupsky\fR = "yes") ALLSTAR computes the sky value
for each group by averaging
the individual sky values in \fIphotfile\fR for all the stars in the
group. If \fIgroupsky\fR = "no", the sky value for each pixel which
contributes to the group fit is set equal to the mean of the sky values
for those stars for which the pixel falls within one fitting radius.
If the DAOPARS parameter \fIfitksy\fR is "yes", then ALLSTAR
recomputes the individual sky values before averaging over the
group, by, every third iteration,
subtracting off the current best fit for the star and using the
pixel values in the annulus defined by the DAOPARS parameters
\fIsannulus\fR and \fIwsannulus\fR to recompute the sky. The actual
sky recomputation is done by averaging forty percent of the sky pixels
centered on the median of the distribution. Recomputing the
sky can significantly reduce the scatter in the magnitudes in regions
where the sky background is varying rapidly.

Only pixels within the good data range defined by the DATAPARS task
parameters \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR are included in the fit.
Most users set \fIdatamin\fR and \fIdatamax\fR so as to 
exclude pixels outside the linearity
regime of the detector. By default all the data is fit.
Users are advised to determine accurate values for these parameters
for their detector and set the values in DATAPARS before beginning any DAOPHOT
reductions.

Only pixels within the fitting radius 
parameter \fIfitrad\fR / \fIscale\fR are included in the fit for each star.
\fIFitrad\fR is located in the DAOPARS task and \fIscale\fR is located in
the DATAPARS task.  Since the non-linear least-squares
fits normally compute three unknowns, the x and y position of the
star's centroid
and its brightness, the value of \fIfitrad\fR  must be
sufficiently
large to include at least three pixels in the fit for each star.
To accelerate the convergence of the non-linear least-squares fitting
algorithm pixels within \fIfitrad\fR are assigned weights which
are  inversely proportional to the radial distance of the pixel from the x and
y centroid of the star, falling from a maximum at the centroid
to zero at the fitting radius. \fIFitrad\fR must be sufficiently large
to include at least three pixels with non-zero radial weights in the
fit for each star. ALLSTAR arbitrarily imposes a minimum number of good
pixels limit of four.
Values of \fIfitrad\fR close to the full-width at half-maxima of the
PSF are recommended.

ALLSTAR computes a weighted fit to the PSF. The weight of each pixel
is computed by combining, the radial weighting function described above,
with weights derived from the random errors ALLSTAR predicts based on the
detector noise characteristics specified by the DATAPARS parameters
\fIreadnoise\fR and \fIepadu\fR,
and the flat-fielding and profile interpolation errors specified
by the DAOPARS task \fIflaterr\fR and \fIproferr\fR parameters.
Both to obtain optimal fits, and
because ALLSTAR employs a conservative formula for reducing the weights
of deviant pixels (parametrized by the \fIclipexp\fR and \fIcliprange\fR
parameters in
the DAOPARS task) which do not approach the model as the fit proceeds,
which depends on \fIreadnoise\fR,  \fIepadu\fR, \fIflaterr\fR,
and \fIproferr\fR, users
are strongly advised to determine those parameters accurately 
and to enter their values in DATAPARS and DAOPARS before beginning any DAOPHOT
reductions.

By default for each group of stars to be fit during each iteration,
ALLSTAR extracts a subraster
from \fIimage\fR which extends approximately
\fIfitrad\fR / \fIscale\fR + 1 pixels wide past the limiting values of x
and y coordinates
of the stars in the group. \fIFitrad\fR
is the fitting radius specified in the DAOPARS task. \fIScale\fR is the image
scale specified by the DATAPARS task. \fIFitrad\fR may
be less than or equal to but can never exceed the value of the image header
parameter "PSFRAD" in \fIpsfimage\fR.

If the \fIcache\fR parameter is set to "yes" then
ALLSTAR attempts to store all the vectors and arrays in memory.
This can significantly reduce the system overhead but may cause excessive
paging on machines with a small amount of memory. For large images
it may be necessary to set \fIcache\fR to "no", and use the disk for
scratch storage. Users should experiment to see what suits them best.

As well as the computed x and y centers, sky values, and magnitudes,
ALLSTAR outputs
the number of times the PSF fit had to be iterated before convergence was
achieved. The
minimum number of iterations is four. The maximum
number of iteration permitted is specified by the 
\fImaxiter\fR parameter in the DAOPARS task.
Obviously the results for stars which
have reached the maximum iteration count should be viewed with 
suspicion. However since the convergence criteria are quite strict,
(the computed magnitude must change  by less than .0005 magnitudes or
0.10 sigma whichever is larger and the x and y centroids must change
by less than 0.002 pixels from one iteration to the next), even
these stars may be reasonably well measured.

ALLSTAR computes a goodness of fit statistic chi which is essentially the
ratio of the observed pixel-to-pixel scatter in the fitting residuals
to the expected scatter. Since the expected scatter is dependent
on the DATAPARS task parameters \fIreadnoise\fR and \fIepadu\fR,
and the DAOPARS parameters \fIflaterr\fR and \fIproferr\fR,
it is important for these values to be set correctly.
A plot of chi versus magnitude should scatter around
unity with little or no trend in chi with magnitude, except at the
bright end where saturation effects may be present.

Finally ALLSTAR computes the statistic sharp which estimates the intrinsic
angular size of the measured object outside the atmosphere.
Sharp is roughly defined as the difference between the square of the
width of the object and the square of the width of PSF.
Sharp has values close to zero for single stars, large positive values
for blended doubles and partially resolved galaxies and large
negative values for cosmic rays and blemishes.

ALLSTAR implements a sophisticated star rejection algorithm. First of
all any group of stars which is more than a certain size
is not reduced.  This maximum group
size is specified by the
\fImaxgroup\fR parameter in the DAOPARS task. Large groups may run
into numerical precision problems during the fits, so users should 
increase this parameter with caution.
ALLSTAR however, in contrast to NSTAR,
attempts to subdivide large groups.
If the group is too dense to reduce in size, ALLSTAR throws out the
faintest star in the group and tries to rereduce it.
If two stars in a group
have centroids separated by a critical distance currently set arbitrarily
to 0.37 * the FWHM of the stellar core and their photocentric position
and combined magnitude is assigned to the brighter of the two and the
fainter is eliminated. Any star which converges to magnitude  12.5 magnitudes
greater than the magnitude of the PSF is considered to be non-existent
and eliminated from the group.

After iteration 5, if the faintest star in the group has a 
brightness less than one sigma above zero it is eliminated.
After iteration 10 if the faintest star in the group has a brightness
less than 1.5 sigma above zero it is eliminated. After iteration 15,
or whenever the solutions has converged whichever comes first,
if the faintest star in the group has a brightness less than 2.0 sigma
above zero it is eliminated.
After iterations 5, 10 and 15 if two stars are separated
by more than 0.37 * FWHM and less than 1.0 * FWHM and if the fainter
of the two is more uncertain than 1.0, 1.5 or 2.0 sigma respectively
the fainter one is eliminated.

ALLSTAR replaces the functionality of the
GROUP, GRPSELECT, NSTAR and SUBSTAR task. However the user has little control
over the grouping process and does not know at the end which stars were
fit together. The grouping process is dynamic, as the groups are recomputed
after each iteration, and stars can be fit and leave the group at any
point after the fourth iteration. Therefore the quality of the fits may
vary over the image as a function of crowding in an unknown way.
However ALLSTAR is in most cases the routine of choice.
NSTAR is the task of choice when a user wants to maintain
control over the composition of the stellar groups.

OUTPUT

If \fIverbose\fR = yes, a single line is output to the terminal for
each star fit or rejected. Full output is written to \fIallstarfile\fR
and \fIrejfile\fR. At the beginning of these two files a header listing
the current values of the parameters is written. For each star fit/rejected
the following quantities are written to the output file.

.nf
	id  xcenter  ycenter  mag  merr  msky  niter  sharpness  chi
	    pier  perr
.fi

Id is the id number of the star. Xcenter and ycenter are the fitted 
coordinates in pixels. Mag and merr are the fitted magnitude and magnitude
error respectively. Msky is the individual sky value for the star. Niter
is the number of iterations it took to fit the star and sharpness and
chi are the sharpness and goodness of fit statistic respectively.
Pier and perror are the photometry error code and accompanying error
message respectively.

.ih
ERRORS

If no errors occur during the fitting process then pier is 0. Non-zero
values of pier flag the following error conditions.

.nf
	0		# No error
	1		# The star is in a group too large to fit
	2		# The sky is undefined
	3		# There are too few good pixels to fit the star
	4		# The fit is singular
	5		# The star is too faint
	6		# The star has merged with a brighter star
	7		# The star is off the image
