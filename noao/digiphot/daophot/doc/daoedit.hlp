DESCRIPTION

DAOEDIT is a general purpose tool for interactively examining and editing
the DAOPHOT algorithm parameters located in the parameter sets DATAPARS,
FINDPARS, CENTERPARS, FITSKYPARS, PHOTPARS, and DAOPARS. These five parameter
sets can be listed, edited, and/or unlearned as a group from within DAOEDIT
using the IRAF LPAR, EPAR and UNLEARN utilities.  Any parameter in each of
these five parameter sets can be examined or edited individual using a simple 
command.  Parameters which are defined in terms of radial distance from the
center of a star or in terms of image counts can be examined and edited
interactively using radial profile plots and the graphics cursor.

If \fIcache\fR is yes and the host machine physical memory and working set size
are large enough, the input image pixels are cached in memory. If caching
is enabled the first data measurement will appear to take a long time as the
entire image must be read in before the measurement is actually made. All
subsequent measurements will be very fast because DAOEDIT is accessing memory
not disk.  The point of caching is to speed up random image access by making
the internal image i/o buffers the same size as the image itself. At present
there is no point in enabling caching for images that are less than or equal
to 524288 bytes, i.e. the size of the test image dev$ypix, as the default image
 i/o buffer is exactly that size. However if the size of dev$ypix is doubled by
 converting it to a real image with the chpixtype task then the effect of
caching in interactive is can be quite noticeable if measurements of objects
in the top and bottom halves of the image are alternated.

EXAMPLES

1. Setup the daophot package parameters interactively for the image m92.
This example assumes that the parameters are all initially at their 
default values.

	da> display dev$ypix 1
	da> daoedit dev$ypix

	    ... type :e datapars to edit the data dependent parameters
	    ...	leave scale at 1.0 and datamin at INDEF but set the
	        datamax, readnoise, epadu, exposure, airmass, filter,
		and obstime parameters to appropriate values
	    ... type :l datapars to check the results of the editing

	    ... type :e findpars to check the object detection parameters
	    ... change the findpars threshold parameter from 4.0 to 5.0
		using the command :threshold 5.0

	    ... type i to enter the interactive setup menu
