USAGE
renumber infile

PARAMETERS
.ls infile
The APPHOT/DAOPHOT database to be renumbered.
.le
.ls id = "ID"
The name of the keyword whose value is the sequence number of the object
.le
.ls idoffset = 0
An integer offset  to be added to the id numbers of the stars in
the output renumbered photometry file. If idoffset is > 0, the output
id numbers will run from 1 + idoffset to N + idoffset instead of from 1 to N.

DESCRIPTION
PRENUMBER is a simple task which accepts an APPHOT/DAOPHOT
database file and renumbers the objects in the file from 1 + idoffset
to N + idoffset,
where N is the number of objects in the database. A renumber operation is
often performed
after an append operation to insure that the database objects have unique id
numbers or after a sort to put the id numbers in order.

PRENUMBER is a script which executes TXRENUMBER if the APPHOT/DAOPHOT
database is a text database or TCALC if the file is an STSDAS table
database.

EXAMPLES

1. Renumber a sorted NSTAR database that has been sorted on magnitude.

.nf
   pt> prenumber m92r.nst.1
.fi

2. Renumber a PHOT photometry file of extra stars so as to ensure the
stars' id numbers are  greater than 4000.

.nf
    pt> prenumber m92r.mag.extra idoffset=4000
.fi
