NAME
txrenumber -- renumber a list of APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database
.ih
USAGE
txrenumber textfiles
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls textfiles
The APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database to be renumbered.
.le
.ls idoffset = 0
An integer offset  to be added to the id numbers of the stars in
the output renumbered photometry file. If idoffset is > 0, the output
id numbers will run from 1 + idoffset to N + idoffset instead of from 1 to N.
.le
.ls id = "ID"
The name of the keyword whose value is the sequence number of the object in
the list. After renumbering the original values of the \fIid\fR are replaced
by numbers 1 through N, where N is the total number of objects in the list.
The id keyword must denote an integer quantity.

DESCRIPTION
TXRENUMBER is a simple task which accepts an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text
database file and renumbers all the objects in the file beginning
with 1 and ending with the number of objects in the file.
The renumber operation is performed in place. The original
values of the  \fIid\fR field are replaced by numbers 1 + idoffset
through N + idoffset
where N is the total number of objects in the list.
A renumber operation is typically performed after another
list operation such as TXCONCAT or TXSORT.

EXAMPLES

1. Renumber the stars in a concatenated file produced by TXCONCAT.

.nf
   pt> txrenumber m92rall.mag.1
.fi

2. Renumber a PHOT photometry file of extra stars so as to ensure the
stars' id numbers are  greater than 4000.

.nf
    pt> txrenumber m92r.mag.extra idoffset=4000
.fi
