NAME
pdump - print fields from an APPHOT/DAOPHOT database
.ih
USAGE
pdump infiles fields
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls infiles
The APPHOT/DAOPHOT databases containing the fields to be dumped.
.le
.ls fields
A template defining the fields to be dumped from each record.
In the case of APPHOT/DAOPHOT text databases, the fields are specified by
keywords defined by the
#K and #N entries in the database. Upper or lower case and minimum match
abbreviations are permissible. Some fields such as "mag" may have
multiple entries. An individual entry can be referenced by specifying an
array index, e.g. "MAG[2]" or several values can be selected by
specifying a range of elements, e.g. "MAG[1-3]".
In the case of STSDAS table APPHOT/DAOPHOT databases the fields are the
column names. Names must be spelt in full but upper or lower case is allowed.
In the case of STSDAS table databases, it may be necessary to escape the
leading square bracket so that field "MAG[2]" would be referred to as
"MAG\[2]".  The fields are output in
the order in which they are specified in the template.
.le
.ls headers = no
Dump the APPHOT/DAOPHOT database field headers. The selected
fields are printed on the standard output, preceded by the parameters list,
if \fIparameters\fR = yes, and the keyword, units,
and format information.
.le
.ls parameters = yes
Print the keyword parameters records on the
standard output if \fIheaders\fR = yes.

DESCRIPTION
PDUMP selects a subset of fields specified by the \fIfields\fR
parameter from an APPHOT/DAOPHOT database or a list of databases
and prints the results on the standard output.
If \fIheaders\fR = no, the output is in simple list format
with adjacent fields
separated by whitespace. The fields are printed in the order in
which they appear in \fIields\fR. If \fIheaders\fR = yes, the
selected fields are printed on the standard output, preceded by
the parameter list, if \fIparameters\fR = yes, and the keyword, units,
and format information.
Newlines will not be inserted in the output if the input database
was an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text file, so users should take
care not specify so many output fields as to exceed the IRAF text file
line limit of 161 characters.
Newlines will be inserted if the original database was an
STSDAS table.

PDUMP is a simple CL script which calls TXDUMP if the APPHOT/DAOPHOT
database was a text file and TBDUMP if it was an STSDAS table.
Although the parameters of TBDUMP and TXDUMP have been tailored to
make the two tasks appear as similar as possible each task
offers some capabilites that the other does not. In some
situations users may wish to use the individual tasks instead of the
generic script.

EXAMPLES

1. Select the fields XCENTER and YCENTER from the output of the APPHOT
CENTER task.

.nf
    pt> pdump image.ctr.3 "XCENTER,YCENTER"
.fi

2. Select the fields ID, XCENTER, YCENTER and the first three magnitudes
from the output of the APPHOT PHOT task. In the case of STSDAS table
databases it may be necessary to escape the leading square bracket.

.nf
    pt> pdump image.mag.3 "ID,XCEN,YCEN,MAG[1],MAG[2],MAG[3]"

		   or

    pt> pdump image.mag.3 "ID,XCEN,YCEN,MAG\[1],MAG\[2],MAG\[3]"
.fi


3. Select the ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MSKY and MAG fields from the output
of the DAOPHOT NSTAR task. Print the headers and parameters as well.

.nf
    pt> pdump image.nst.3 "ID,XCENTER,YCENTER,MSKY,MAG"  \
	headers+ parameters+
.fi

BUGS
Users should not dump more fields than fill a 161 character textline
as IRAF does not currently fully support longer text lines.
