DESCRIPTION

PTTEST is a simple script which exercises each of the major tasks in the
PTOOLS package in turn. At startup PTTEST reads a small set of text files
stored in the PTOOLS test subdirectory and creates copies of them in
the user's working directory. PTTEST initializes the PTTOLS package by
returning
all the parameters to their default state, runs each of the PTOOLS
tasks in non-interactive mode, spools the text output to the file
\fIptlogfile\fR, and the graphics output from the PEXAMINE task to the plot
metacode file \fIptplotfile\fR.

Some of PTOOLS tasks which PTTEST attempts to test are in the STSDAS TABLES
package. If this package is not available a warning message will appear 
on the screen and this part of the PTTEST script will be skipped.
The TABLES external addon package is available from ST.
