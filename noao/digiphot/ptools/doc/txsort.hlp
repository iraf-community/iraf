PARAMETERS
.ls textfiles 
The input APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database(s) to be sorted.
The sort is performed in place.
.le
.ls field
The field to be sorted on. \fIField\fR may be any quantity defined by
the APPHOT/DAOPHOT #K and #N keywords. The keywords may be
of type integer or real, in which case a numeric sort is performed,
boolean, in which case the boolean constant "no" has a smaller value

DESCRIPTION
TXSORT is a simple task which accepts a list of APPHOT/DAOPHOT text
database files
and sorts them in place based on the value of the selected field
specifier \fIfield\fR. By default the sort is performed in increasing order
of the value
of \fIfield\fR, but a reverse sort can be performed by 
setting \fIascend\fR = "no".

If \fIfield\fR is a real or integer quantity the sort is numeric; if boolean
the boolean constant "no" is assumed to have a smaller value than "yes"; if
character the sort is alphabetic.
