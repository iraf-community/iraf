NAME
pconvert -- convert an APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database into an STSDAS table
.ih
USAGE
pconvert textfile table fields
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls textfile
The APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database which is to be converted into an
APPHOT/DAOPHOT STSDAS table database.
.le
.ls table
The name of the output STSDAS table database.
.le
.ls fields = "*"
Template defining the fields to be selected from each record. By default
all the fields are output. Fields
are specified by using the names defined in the APPHOT/DAOPHOT text
database by the
#N entries. Upper or lower case and minimum match abbreviations are
permissible. For those fields which have multiple entries such as 
magnitude, an individual value can be referenced by specifying an array
index, e.g. MAG[2] or several values can be selected by specifying a
range of elements, e.g. MAG[1-4].
.le
.ls expr = yes
The boolean expression, evaluated independently for each record,
which serves as a selection criterion. By default all records are selected.
.le
.ls append = no
If append is yes then the converted APPHOT/DAOPHOT text file is appended to an 
existing output STSDAS table database.

DESCRIPTION
PCONVERT selects a subset of the fields from each record of an
APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database and writes these into an STSDAS tabl database.
The #K keyword parameters in the text database are
stored as header parameters in the STSDAS table while the selected fields
are stored in fields (columns) with the names specified by the text
database #N keywords, units specified
by the #U keywords, and print format specified by the #F keywords.

The output records are selected on the basis of the boolean
expression \fIexpr\fR whose variables are the field (column) names
specified by the #N keywords in the APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database.
If after substituting the values associated
with a particular record into the field name variables the
expression evaluates to yes, that record is included in the output table.

The supported
operators and functions are briefly described below. A detailed description
of the boolean expression evaluator and its syntax can be found
in the manual page for the IMAGES package HEDIT task.

The following logical operators can be used in the boolean expression. 

.nf
	equal		  ==	not equal		!=
	less than	  <	less than or equal	<=
	greater than	  >	greater than or equal	>=
	or		  ||	and			&&
	negation	  !	pattern match		?=
	concatenation	  //
.fi

The pattern match character ?=  takes a
string expression as its first argument and a pattern as its second argument.
The result is yes if the pattern is contained in the string expression.
Patterns are strings which may contain pattern matching meta-characters.
The meta-characters themselves can be matched by preceeding them with the escape
character.  The meta-characters are described below. 

.nf
	beginning of string	^	end of string		$
	one character		?	zero or more characters	*
	white space		#	escape character	\
	ignore case		{	end ignore case		}
	begin character class	[	end character class	]
	not, in char class	^	range, in char class	-
.fi

The boolean expression may also include arithmetic operators and functions.
The following arithmetic operators and functions are supported.

.nf
addition		+		subtraction		-
multiplication		*		division		/
negation		-		exponentiation		**
absolute value		abs(x)		cosine			cos(x)
sine			sin(x)		tangent			tan(x)
arc cosine		acos(x)		arc sine		asin(x)
arc tangent		atan(x)		arc tangent		atan2(x,y)
exponential		exp(x)		square root		sqrt(x)
natural log		log(x)		common log		log10(x)
minimum			min(x,y)	maximum			max(x,y)
convert to integer	int(x)		convert to real		real(x)
nearest integer		nint(x)		modulo			mod(x)
.fi

If the append parameter is "yes" then the converted input text database is
appended to the specified output table. When appending to a table each of the
output fields must already exist in the output table.

EXAMPLES

1. Convert the text output from the DAOPHOT PHOT task in the file n4147.mag.1
to an STSDAS table, selecting only the fields ID, XCENTER, YCENTER,
MAG,and MSKY ncessary for input to the DAOPHOT fitting routines.
Put the output in an STSDAS table named n4147.tmag.1.

.nf
   pt> pconvert n4147.mag.1 n4147.tmag.1 "ID,XCENTER,YCENTER,MAG,MSKY"
.fi

If there were 4 magnitude fields in n4147.mag.1
then there would be 4 columns in the output table with names of 
MAG[1], MAG[2], MAG[3] and MAG[4]

2. Convert the same file as in example 1. but append the output to
   n4147.tmag.1 and only select records with YCENTER <= 200.0.

.nf
   pt> pconvert n4147.mag.1 n4147.tmag.1 "ID,XCENTER,YCENTER,MAG,MSKY" \
       expr="YCENTER < 200.0" append+
.fi

3. Convert all the records in the NSTAR text database n4147.nst.1 to
   an STSDAS table.

.nf
   pt> pconvert n4147.nst.1 n4147.tnst.1 "*"
.fi

BUGS
Changes in the values of the #K keyword quantities which are permitted by
the APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database format will be lost in the conversion to
STSDAS table format which does not permit such changes. For example users
who have
set up and run PHOT interactively and changed the values of the parameters
after writing the first record to the text database will see only the initial
values of the #K keywords in the STSDAS table headers after conversion.
