PLOTTING PARAMETERS

PEXAMINE supports five types of plots 1) an X-Y column plot
2) a histogram column plot 3) a radial profile plot 4) a surface
plot and 5) a contour plot.
Each supported plot type has its own parameter set which
controls the appearance of the plot.
The names of the five parameter sets are listed below.

.nf
    cntrplot	Parameters for the contour plot
    histplot	Parameters for the column histogram plot
    radplot	Parameters for radial profile plot

.fi

The same  parameters dealing with graph formats occur in many of the parameter
sets while some are specific only to one parameter set.  In the
summary below those common to more than one parameter set are shown
only once.  The characters in parenthesis are the graph key prefixes
for the parameter sets in which the parameter occurs.

DESCRIPTION

PEXAMINE is a general purpose tool for interactively examining and editing
photometry catalogs produced by the APPHOT or DAOPHOT packages. It is
intended to aid the user in assessing the accuracy of the photometry,
in diagnosing problems with particular catalog objects,
in searching the photometry data for relationships
between the computed quantities, and in editing the catalog based on
those observed relationships. PEXAMINE is intended to complement the
more batch oriented editing facilities of the PSELECT task.

PEXAMINE takes the input catalog \fIinput\fR and the corresponding
image \fIimage\fR (if defined) and produces an output catalog of selected
objects \fIoutput\fR (if defined) and an output catalog of deleted objects
\fIdeletions\fR (if defined). The input catalog may be either an
APPHOT/DAOPHOT text database or an ST binary table database.
The file type of the output catalogs \fIoutput\fR and \fIdeletions\fR
is the same as that of \fIinput\fR.

READING IN THE DATA

PEXAMINE reads the column data specified by \fIphotcolumns\fR and
\fIusercolumns\fR for up to \fImax_nstars\fR into memory. If there are
more than \fImax_nstars\fR in the input catalog only the data for the
first \fImax_nstars\fR is read. The \fIphotcolumns\fR parameter
defines the list of standard photometry columns to be loaded. If
"daophot" or "apphot" is selected then the standard columns
are GROUP, ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MSKY, MAG, MERR, CHI, SHARP and NITER
and ID, XCENTER, YCENTER, MSKY, MAG and MERR respectively.
Otherwise the user must set \fIphotcolumns\fR to his or her own preferred
list of standard photometry columns. Non-standard columns may also be
specified using the parameter \fIusercolumns\fR.
Valid column lists contain the full names of the specified columns
in upper or lower case letters, separated by commas.
Either \fIphotcolumns\fR or 
\fIusercolumns\fR may be redefined interactively by the user after
the task has started up, but only at the
expense of rereading the data from \fIinput\fR.

PEXAMINE will fail to load a specified column if that column is
not in the photometry database, is of a datatype other than
integer or real, or adding that column would exceed the maximum
number of columns limit currently set at twenty. The user can
interactively examine the list of requested and loaded standard
photometry columns, as well as list all the columns in the input
after the task has started up.

GRAPHICS AND IMAGE COMMAND MODE

PEXAMINE accepts commands either from the graphics cursor \fIgcommands\fR
(graphics command mode) or the image display cursor \fIicommands\fR
if available (image command mode).
PEXAMINE starts up in graphics command mode, but all the
interactive commands are accessible from both modes and the user can
switch modes at any time assuming that the \fIuse_display\fR parameter
to "yes".

PEXAMINE interprets the cursor position in graphics mode
differently from how it interprets it in image command mode.
In graphics command mode the cursor coordinates are the position
of the cursor in the current plot, whereas in image command mode they
are the x and y coordinates of the cursor in the displayed image.
For example, if the user issues a command to PEXAMINE to locate the object
in the catalog nearest the point in the current X-Y plot marked by
the graphics cursor, PEXAMINE does so by searching
the data for the object whose values of \fIxcolumn\fR and \fIycolumn\fR
most closely match those of the current cursor position.
If the user issues a command  to PEXAMINE to locate the
object in the catalog corresponding to the object marked on the image
display with the image cursor,
PEXAMINE does so by searching the data for
the object whose values of \fIxposcolumn\fR and \fIyposcoumn\fR
most closely match and fall within \fImatch_radius\fR of the current
cursor position.

Input to PEXAMINE is through single keystroke commands or colon
commands. Keystroke commands are simple commands that may
optionally use the cursor position but otherwise require no arguments.
The PEXAMINE keystroke commands fall into three categories, basic
commands, data examining commands and data editing commands, all
described in detail in the following sections. Colon commands
take an optional argument and function differently depending on
the presence or absence of that argument. When the argument is absent
colon commands are used to display the
current value of a parameter or list of parameters. When the argument is
present they change their current value to that argument.
The basic colon commands are described in detail below. 

BASIC KEYSTROKE COMMANDS

These keystroke commands are used to display the help page, switch from
graphics to image command mode and quit the task.

.ls ?
Page through the help for the PEXAMINE task
.le
.ls :
Execute a PEXAMINE colon command.
.le
.ls g
Change to graphics command mode. Throughout PEXAMINE graphics command mode
is the default. All PEXAMINE commands are available in graphics command
mode.
.le
.ls i
Change to image command mode.
All the PEXAMINE commands are available in image command mode.
However if \fIuse_display\fR is no and the image
cursor has not been aliased to the standard input or a text file
image command mode is disabled.
.le
.ls q
Quit PEXAMINE without writing an output catalog.
PEXAMINE queries the user for confirmation of this option.
.le
.ls e
Quit PEXAMINE and write the output catalog.
.le

DATA EXAMINING COMMANDS

The data examining commands fall into two categories, those that examine
the catalog data including 'l' (catalog listing), 'o' (object listing),
'x' (Y column versus X column plot) and 'h' (histogram column plot)
commands, and those which examine the image data around specific catalog
objects including 'r' (radial profile plotting), 's' (surface plotting),
'c' (contour plotting) and 'm' (pixel dumping). The latter group
require that \fIimage\fR be defined. A brief summary of each data
examining command is given below.
.ls l
Print out the name, datatype, and units for all the columns in the input
catalog. The list command can be used to check the contents of the input
catalog and/or determine why a particular column was not loaded.
.le
.ls o
Print out the names and values of the stored columns of the object
nearest the cursor. In graphics mode the current plot type must be
X-Y. In image command mode the object nearest the cursor must also be
no more than \fImatch-radius\fR pixels away from the image cursor to be
found. If an object is found and the current plot type is X-Y
the graphics cursor is moved to the position of the selected object
in the X-Y plot.
.le
.ls x
Plot the data in \fIycolumn\fR versus the data in \fIxcolumn\fR excluding
any already deleted points and identifying objects marked for deletion
with a cross. X-Y plotting is undefined if \fIxcolumn\fR or \fIycolumn\fR
is undefined.
.le
.ls h
Plot the histogram of the data in \fIhcolumn\fR excluding any already 
deleted points and those marked for deletion. Histogram plotting is
disabled if \fIhcolumn\fR is undefined.
.le
.ls r
Plot the radial profile of the object nearest the cursor including
only pixels within a distance of \fIrinner\fR and \fIrouter\fR of
the object center. Radial profile plotting is disabled if \fIimage\fR
or \fIxposcolumn\fR or \fIyposcolumn\fR is undefined.
.le
.ls s
Plot the surface plot of the object nearest the cursor including
only pixels within an image section \fIncols\fR by \fInlines\fR
around the object center. Surface plotting is disabled if \fIimage\fR
or \fIxposcolumn\fR or \fIyposcolumn\fR is undefined.
.le
.ls c
Plot the contour plot of the object nearest the cursor including
only pixels within an image section \fIncols\fR by \fInlines\fR
around the object center. Contour plotting is disabled if \fIimage\fR
or \fIxposcolumn\fR or \fIyposcolumn\fR is undefined.
.le
.ls m
Dump the pixel values of a grid of 10 by 10 pixels around the object
nearest the cursor. Pixel value dumping is disabled if \fIimage\fR
or \fIxposcolumn\fR or \fIyposcolumn\fR is undefined.
.le
.ls p
Replot the current graph.
.le

DATA EDITING COMMANDS

Data points can be deleted from the catalog in either graphics command
mode or image
command mode. In graphics command mode the 
graphics cursor and either the X-Y or histogram plot is used to delete points.
In image command mode the image cursor and the displayed
image are used to delete points. A data point has three possible states
good, marked for deletion and deleted.
Any one of the keystroke commands 'd' (delete point), '(' (delete points
with x less than x cursor), ')' (delete points with x greater than x cursor,
'^' (delete points with y > y cursor), 'v' (delete points with y < y cursor)
or 'b' (delete points in a box) can be used to mark points for deletion.
The 'f' key is used to actually delete the points and replot the data.
In between marking the points for deletion and actually deleting the marked
points the 't' (toggle) key can be used to undelete the last set marked.
The full list of the data editing keystroke commands is given below.

.ls z
Undelete not just unmark all the data points replot.
.le
.ls f
Delete points marked for deletion and replot. Points marked for deletion
but not actually deleted will be written to the output catalog and not
written to the deletions catalog.
.le
.ls d
Mark the point nearest the cursor for deletion.
.le
.ls u
Undelete the marked point nearest the cursor.
.le
.ls (
Mark all points with x values less than the x value of the cursor for
deletion.  In graphics command mode points can only be marked for deletion if
the current plot type is "xyplot" or "histplot". In image command
mode \fIxposcolumn\fR and \fIyposcolumn\fR must be defined before
points can be marked for deletion.
.le
.ls )
Mark all points with x values greater than the x value of the cursor for
deletion.  In graphics command mode points can only be marked for deletion if
the current plot type is "xyplot" or "histplot". In image command
mode \fIxposcolumn\fR and \fIyposcolumn\fR must be defined before
points can be marked for deletion.
.le
.ls v
Mark all points with y values less than the y value of the cursor for
deletion.  In graphics command mode points can only be marked for deletion if
the current plot type is "xyplot". In image command
mode \fIxposcolumn\fR and \fIyposcolumn\fR must be defined before
points can be marked for deletion.
.le
.ls ^
Mark all points with y values greater than the y value of the cursor for
deletion.  In graphics command mode points can only be marked for deletion if
the current plot type is "xyplot". In image command
mode \fIxposcolumn\fR and \fIyposcolumn\fR must be defined before
points can be marked for deletion.
.le
.ls b
Mark all points within a box whose lower left and upper right hand corners
are marked by the cursor for deletion.
In graphics mode points can only be marked for deletion if the current
plot type is "xyplot". In image command mode \fIxposcolumn\fR and
\fIyposcolumn\fR must be defined before points can be marked for
deletion.
.le
.ls t
Toggle between marking points for deletion or undeletion. The default
is to mark points for deletion.
.le

EXAMPLES

1. Examine and edit an APPHOT aperture photometry catalog and a DAOPHOT
allstar catalog without either attaching the associated image or using the
image display.

.nf
    pt> pexamine m92.mag.1 m92.mag.ed use_display-

	... a plot of magnitude error versus magnitude appears on
	    the screen and the graphics cursor comes up ready to accept
	    commands

	... the user sees a generally smooth trend of increasing
	    magnitude error with increasing magnitude except for a
	    single deviant point at the bright end of the plot

	... the user decides to remove the deviant point using the
	    'd' keystroke command to mark the point and the 'f'
	    keystroke command to actually delete and replot the graph

	... after examining the plot further the user decides to delete
	    all objects for which the magnitude error is > 0.1 magnitudes
	    using the '^' keystroke command, followed by the 'f'
	    keystroke command to actually replot and delete the data.

	... after deciding that this new plot is satisfactory the user
	    issues the 'e' keystroke command to exit pexamine and save
	    the good data in m92.mag.ed

    pt> pexamine m92.als.1 m92.als.ed use_display-

	... a plot of magnitude error versus magnitude appears on the
	    screen and the graphics cursor comes up ready to accept
	    commands

	... after looking at the plot the user decides that what they
	    really want to see is a plot of the goodness of fit parameter
	    chi versus magnitude

	... the user issues the colon command :ycol chi followed by 'p'
	    keystroke command to replot the data

	... the user sees a generally smooth trend of increasing
	    chi with increasing magnitude 

	... after examining the plot further the user decides to delete
	    all objects for which the chi value  > 2.0  and the
	    magnitude is > 25 using the '^' key and ')' keystroke
	    commands followed by 'f' to save the deletions and replot
	    the data

	... after deciding that this new plot is satisfactory the user
	    issues the 'e' keystroke command to exit pexamine and save
	    the good data in m92.als.ed
.fi

2. Examine and edit a DAOPHOT allstar catalog using the subtracted image, the
original image and the image display.

.nf
	pt> display image.sub 1

	    ... display the subtracted image

	pt> pexamine orionk.als.1 orionk.als.ed image xcol=mag ycol=chi

	... a plot of the goodness of fit versus magnitude appears
	    on the terminal and the graphics cursor comes up ready to
	    accept commands

	... the user notices some very anomalous chi values and decides
	    to see if these correspond to objects which have poor
	    subtraction on the displayed image

	... the user switches to image command mode by tapping the 'i'
	    key, moves to the first poorly subtracted object and taps
	    the 'o' key

	... a list of the values of the loaded columns including chi
	    appears in the text window , the program switches to graphics
	    mode and places the graphics cursor on the corresponding
	    point in the X-Y plot

	... the point in question indeed has a very high chi value
	    and the user decides to try and investigate the reason for the
	    anomalous value

	... the user taps the 'r' key to get a radial profile of the
	    object in the original image

	... after carefully examining the profile it appears that the
	    object's profile is too broad and that it is not a star

	... the user switches back to the X-Y plot with the 'x' key,
	    marks the point with the 'd' key and saves the deletions
	    and replots with the 'f' key.

	... the user goes back to image command mode with the 'i' key
	    and begins investigating the next object

	... finally after examining the image and making all the changes
	    the user decides to quit and save the changes with the 'e' key

BUGS
If the display device is on a remote resource the first image cursor
request will cause PEXAMINE to hang. The remote resource is expecting
the appropriate password which the user must type in to cause the 
the image cursor to appear. The normal password prompt is
not being issued or flushed to the terminal. The solution to the problem
is to put the password in the .irafhosts file

INDEF valued points cannot be accessed by
PEXAMINE. INDEF valued points should be removed from the input catalog
with PSELECT prior to entering PEXAMINE.
