ptools$pconvert/ptdeftable.x
    pt_kstati() was being declared pointer instead of int (7/13/09, MJF)

ptools$pexamine/ptsetup.x
    pt_getnames() was declared a pointer instead of int (7/12/09, MJF)

ptools$pconvert/ptconvert.x
ptools$pconvert/txtools/ptxcalc.x
ptools$pconvert/txtools/ptxdump.x
ptools$pconvert/txtools/ptxselect.x
    Added missing xev_freeop calls to the pconvert, txcalc, txdump, and
    txselect tasks so that memory is released if any of the input operands
    are strings.

    (Davis, March 6, 2002)


ptools$mkpkg
    Modified the mkpkg procedures to pick up user compile and link flags.

    (Davis, June 17, 1999)

ptools$ptools.cl
    Modified the package cl script to check and see if the tables package is
    already loaded before checking to see if it exists and then loading it.

    (Davis, August 1, 1998)

ptools$pdump.cl
    Modified the way the pdump script handles the tdump pwidth parameter
    to work around a change made to the tables.ttools.tdump task. The solution
    is not ideal because it leaves the value of tdump.pwidth.p_max
    modified but the parameter value is not changed.

    (Davis, August 15, 1997)

ptools$pconcat.cl
    Added a missing "cache ("istable")" statement that could cause trouble
    if the pconcat script was called from a backgroound job.

    (Davis, July 28, 1997)

ptools$txtools/t_txselect.x
    Changed the maximimum size of the expression to be evaluated from
    SZ_FNAME to SZ_LINE which is what it was supposed to be.

    (Davis, May 25, 1996)

ptools$tbdump.cl
    If the input file was an ST binary table file and the expression parameter
    was not equal to "yes", the intermediate tables file was not being deleted
    when the tbdump and pdump tasks terminated. The problem was due to the
    ".tab" extension that was added to the tables name but not sensed by
    the delete command. I switched the delete command to a tdelete command
    and everything worked fine.

    (Davis, Nov 2, 1995)

ptools/pexamine/pexmine.h
ptools/pexamine/ptcolon.x
    The rinner and router colon commands were incorrectly coded as rin and
    rout colon commands in the pexamine.h file. The :router command was also
    incorrectly writing back its results into the rinner parameter.

    (Davis, May 1, 1995)

ptools/ptutils/t_tbcrename.x
ptools/ptutils/t_tbkeycol.x
    Add several new checks for input text files to avoid a problem with
    a text file being opened as a binary table. This problem prably appeared
    when tables was modified to support simple text files (tables 1.3.3 for
    sure, proably 1.3.2 as well, not sure before that).

    (Davis, March 21, 1995)


ptools/tbconcat.cl
    Add a test for the existence of the ttools.keypar.silent parameter
    for backwards compatability between tables 1.3.3 and 1.3.2.

    (Davis, Feb 25, 1995)

ptools/pexamine/ptplot.x
    An off the end of the array computation error in the routine pt_hplot
    was causing an invalid floating point operation on the Dec Alpha when
    the user tried to plot the histogram of an array,

    (Davis, Feb 23, 1995)

ptools/pconvert/ptdeftable.x
    Modified the pconvert task so that header space is preallocated rather
    than added as needed. This significantly speeds up the task performance
    by decreasing the number of disk writes required. This change was
    made in response to a suggestion from PHil Hodge at ST.

    (Davis, Feb 2, 1995)

ptools/txtools/t_txcalc.x
ptools/txtools/ptxcalc.x
ptools/tbcalc.cl
ptools/pcalc.cl
ptools/doc/pcalc.hlp
ptools/doc/tbcalc.hlp
ptools/doc/txcalc.hlp
    Added the tasks txcalc, tbcalc, and pcalc to the ptools package.
    This tasks perform arithmetic operations on the fields or columns
    of photometry files written with apphot or daophot tasks.

    (Davis, May 31 1993)

ptools/pexamine
    Fixed numerous small bugs in the pexamine task including: 1)
    unclear error messages if the default x-y or histogram plot columns could
    not be found on task startup 2) initialization bug that could cause
    the output edited catalog to be written incorrectly on the
    second or higher run of pexamine, 3) added a 5% buffer around all
    the plots so the user can see the plotted data better, 4) added
    the standard deviation of the sky to the standard apphot columns, 5)
    a misleading error message in the colon command to change the
    default histogram column.

    (Davis, May 22 1993)

ptools/ptutils/t_istable.x
    Modified the istable task, which is called by the pconcat, pdump,
    prenumber, pselect, and psort script tasks so that it could deal
    correctly with the fact that legal tables files might be text files.

    (Davis, May 12 1993)

ptools/pdump.cl
ptools/pttest.cl
ptools/tbdump.cl
ptools/tbrenumber.cl
    Added an expression parameter to the pdump task.

    (Davis, Feb 25, 1993)

ptools/tbrenumber.cl
ptools/prenumber.cl
    Modified the tbrenumber and prenumber scripts so they can use 
    the tables 1.2.1 version of tcalc as well as the 1.2 version.
    The parameters verbose and harmless present in the 1.2 version
    were removed from the 1.2.1 version.

    (Davis, June 1, 1992)

ptools$pexamine/ptplot.x
    1. The error message "Star not found" would persist after a star
    was successfully found because no status line message was printed
    out after a succesful find operation.

    (Davis, April 7, 1992)

ptools$tbdump.cl
ptools$tbrenumber.cl
ptools$prenumber.cl
    1. Changed the name of the pagwidth parameter to pwidth the call to the
    ttools package task tdump because the parameter was renamed in the 
    version 1.2 of tables.

    2. Changed the value of the tcalc equals parameter from ":ROWNUM" 
    to "rownum" in calls to tcalc made by the tbrenumber and prenumber
    tasks.

    Changed the name of the renumber task to prenumber.
    Changed the name of the select task to pselect.
    Changed the name of the sort task to psort.
    Changed the name of the convert task to pconvert.

    (Davis, October 8, 1991)

ptools$pttest.cl
ptools$doc/pttest.hlp
    Added the new task pttest to the ptools package. Pttest runs basic tests
    on the ptools package.

    (Davis, October 8, 1991)

ptools$pexamine/ptplot.x
    Changed the status line message so that it is printed only when the
    first plot is made or new data is read in.

    (Davis, October 7, 1991) 

    *** Applied the results of spplint to the ptools package.

ptools$convert/t_convert.x
    Removed 2 extra arguments from the strupr call.
    This could be a problem in the old testphot.

ptools$convert/ptconvert.x
    Changed an illegal logical NOT construct to an integer == NO construct.
    This was not a problem in the old testphot.
     
    Removed unused variable record form the pt_convert routine.

ptools$convert/ptdeftable.x
    Removed an extra argument from the pt_gnfn call. This routine has
    changed and this bug was not a problem in the old testphot..

ptools$pexamine/ptgetphot.x
    Removed an extra argument from the pt_gnfn call. This routine has
    changed. Pexamine did not exist in the old testphot so this was not
    a problem.

ptools$pexamine/ptplot.x
    Removed an extra argument from the pt_gnfn call. This routine has
    changed. Pexamine did not exist in the old testphot so this was not
    a problem.

    Removed an extra argument from pt_rxydata. This routine has changed.
    Pexamine did not exist in the old testphot so this was not a problem.

    Removed unused variables x1, y1 from the pt_gcur routine.

ptools$pexamine/ptcolon.x
    Removed an extra argument for a clgetr command.
    Pexamine did not exist in the old testphot so this was not a problem.

ptools$txtools/t_txdump.x
    Removed two extra arguments from the call to strupr. This could have
    been a problem in the old testphot.

ptools$txtools/ptxdump.x
    Changed an illegal logical NOT construct to an integer == NO construct.
    This was not a problem in the old testphot.

ptools$txtools/ptxselect.x
    Changed an illegal logical NOT construct to an integer == NO construct.
    This was not a problem in the old testphot.

ptools$txtools/ptsortnum.x
    Removed unused argument colwidth from the pt_colsort routine.

    Davis, October 3, 1991


ptools$renumber.cl
ptools$tbrenumber.cl
    Changed the calls to the tables tcalc task to include all the hidden
    parameters.

    Davis, October 1, 1991

ptools$
    1. Deleted the append, dump, renumber, select and sort sub-directories
    and consolidated then into the txtools sub-directory.

    2. Several small files were eliminated by  concantenating them into other
    existing files in txtools, pexamine, and convert.

    3. Changed the way selected keywords are stored in the text database
    data structures. The index, instead of the pointer is stored. This removes
    potential problems with reallocating the record structures, when the
    test database files contain variable-sized records. All the text database
    tools were affected, as  were a couple of files in daophot.

    4. Modified txdump, txrenumber, txselect, txsort and pexamine so that they
    could correctly deal with variable-sized records instead of crashing,
    if a given record was larger than the first record in the file.

    5. Completely rewrote convert.

    6. Added an offset parameter to pexamine so that the user can elect
    to read portions of an input photometry catalog into memory for plotting
    and examining.

    Davis, August 13, 1991

ptools$
    1. Renamed the hidden tcolrename task need for the photcal preprocessors to
    tbcrename in conformance with the new standards.

    2. Added a help page for tbcrename.

    Davis, May 24, 1991

ptools$
    1. Renamed the hidden tkeycol task need for the photcal preprocessors to
    tbkeycol in conformance with the new standards.

    Davis, May 24, 1991

ptools$renumber/t_txrenumber.x
    1. The txrenumber task will now accept a list of images.

    Davis, May 24, 1991

ptools$
    1. The ptools package now loads the tables package on startup.

    2. The tasks tappend, tdump, trenumber, tselect, and tsort have now become
    tbappend, tbdump, tbrenumber, tbselect and tbsort. These tasks work
    on binary tables files. All are now scripts which call a tables
    package task. All 5 tasks now operate on lists of tables files.

    Davis, May 24, 1991

ptools$pttables/ptkeywords.x
ptools$pttables/ptconvert.x
    1. Fixed a problem with embedded blanks in string parameters in the
    apphot/daophot database files. The format and units string were not being
    correctly read because the second part of the value string was being read
    into the units string, the units string was being read into the filter
    string etc. This was only a problem for keywords (#K) because they
    are read in free format. It was not a problem for columns (#N).
    The format will now default to %-20s if it can not be decoded
    and only the first part of the string will be kept. The units string
    will be incorrect. There may be a more elegant solution
    later but this fix will work for now.

    Davis, Apr 2, 1991

ptools$pttables/ptmkrec.x
    1. All of the ptools tasks which operate on text files convert, txappend, 
    txdump, txrenumber, txselect, txsort and pexamine have been modfied
    to be more efficient. Calls to strmatch have been replaced by calls
    to strncmp. Convert, txdump and txselect no longer call the expression
    evaluator if the expression is a simple "yes" string.

    2. Ptmkrec has been modified to be more efficient for the simple case
    where there is only a single aperture.

    Davis, Mar 29, 1991

ptools$
    1. Added the new hidden task tkeycol to the ptools package. Tkeycol
    converts ST table header keywords into new ST table columns. It is not
    intended to be seen directly by the user but will be used in some
    of the preprocessing scripts in the photcal package.

    2. Added the new hidden task tcolrename to the ptools package. Tcolrename
    renames selected columns in a list of ST tables. It is not intended to
    be seen directly by the user but will be used in some of the preprocessing
    scripts in the ptools package.

    Davis, Mar 2, 1991

ptools$convert/ptconvert.x
    Convert was preallocating space for 150 columns in the output table. In
    rare cases where the user had a large number of apertures (20 or so)
    in a phot text file convert could overwrite memory and crash the task.

    Davis, Oct 4, 1990

ptools$tvmark/
    Removed tvmark from ptools since it is duplicated in proto.

    Davis, Jul 9, 1990

ptools$convert/ptdeftable.x
    Corrected a bug in the convert task wherein the code was trying to
    load a string quantity into a boolean parameter. This caused the
    code to crash on Orion was worked ok on the sparc station.

    Davis, Jun 7, 1990

ptools$pttables/tappend.cl
    Removed two harmless debugging statements from the tappend.cl script.

    Davis, Jan 8, 1989

ptools$pttables/pthdrs.x
    An off the end of the array access error was occurring for the format and
    units string in the case where the header was duplicated in an input
    text database file. This bug sometimes caused meomory corruption errors
    in several of the daophot tasks and in the ptools tasks txsort, txdump,
    txrenumber and txselect.
