    Added task to set Julian dates in image headers.
    (1/29/92, Valdes)

asttools$asttimes.x
asttools$asthjd.x
    1.  Added additional conversions from date to JD and back from
	Numerical Receipes without having to go through the epoch.
    2.  Added HJD from JD without needing to go through the epoch.
    (1/29/92, Valdes)

astutil$t_setairmass.x
astutil$setairmass.par
astutil$doc/setairmass.hlp
    1.  Changed the default action to update the image headers.
    2.  Added an update field to the show listing.
    3.  A warning is printed if show=no and update=no since this is a noop.
    (11/5/91, Valdes)

astutil$t_setairmass.x
    The hour angle was slightly incorrect because universal time, from
    the exposure time, was used instead of siderial time in computing the
    midpoint.  (8/26/91, Seaman)

astutil$asttools/*.x
    Coerced all constants with many significant digits to double precision.
    (6/24/91, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asthjd.x
    The dummy argument t was changed to lt as declared.  (6/24/91, Valdes)

    Updated to use observatory parameter.  (11/19/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_obs.x +
astutil$x_astutil.x
astutil$mkpkg
astutil$astutil.cl
astutil$astutil.men
astutil$astutil.hd
    1.  A new version of the observatory task based on an observatory database
    using the new interface obsdb.x in xtools was added to the astutil
    executable.
    2.  The observatory help was revised and moved to astutil.
    3.  The observatory task itself is defined in noao and was removed
    from the astutil package definitions.
    (11/6/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    Added a modulus operations to convert any zone to the range -12 to 12.
    (9/28/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    Changed the procedure times to ast_times to avoid a name conflict in the
    HPUX port.  This is a better name anyway.  (9/8/90, Valdes)

astutil$asttimes.par
    Removed the range limits on the zone.  Zones east of Greenwich need to
    be negative to obtain the correct dates.  (6/15/90, Valdes)

astutil$doc/galactic.hlp
    Corrected comment about epoch of galactic coordinates.  Added an example
    showing how to get galactic coordinates for images containing
    equitorial coordinates.  (5/23/90, Valdes)

====
V2.9
====

astutil$setairmass.par
astutil$t_setairmass.x
    The task now precesses the coordinates to the epoch of the
    observation.  (2/2/90, Seaman)

astutil$astutil.hd
    The path to the sources to PDM was not defined correctly.
    Changed src=pdm/t_pdm.x to src=pdm$t_pdm.x. (1/28/90 Lytle)

astutil$t_setairmass.x +

astutil$x_astutil.x
astutil$mkpkg
astutil$astutil.cl
astutil$astutil.men
astutil$astutil.hd
    Added a new task to compute and update airmass and universal time
    in image headers based on the exposure.  (5/19/89, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The leap year was not handled correctly for the centuries in
    ast_day_of_year.  (5/11/89, Valdes)

astutil$rvcorrect.par
astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
astutil$doc/rvcorrect.hlp
     Added 'imupdate' parameter to make updating image headers with
     computed corrections an option.  (5/5/89, Fitzpatrick)

astutil$galactic.x
astutil$galactic.par
astutil$doc/galactic.hlp
astutil$asttools/astgaltoeq.x +
    GALACTIC now can transform in either direction.  (2/14/89, Valdes)

noao$astutil/t_rvcorrect.x
noao$astutil/doc/rvcorrect.hlp
    Changed the keywords and output when using images.  The observed
    velocity must now be VOBS.  The output is HJD, VHELIO, VLSR, and
    VSUN (a record of the Sun's velocity used for VLSR).  (12/14/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/asttools/ast_galactic.x
    The galactic task was not precessing the input coordinates before
    computing the galactic coordinates.

    I changed the single precision defined constants to double precision
    and the in line constant 15 to 15.0d0.
    (9/15/88 Davis)

noao$astutil/astvorbit.x
noao$astutil/astvbary.x
noao$astutil/asthjd.x
    The calls to AST_COORD needed double precision arguments.  (7/26/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/astutil.cl
    Added OBSERVATORY task to this package.  (4/12/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/galactic.x
    The double precision variables lii and bii where being printed with
    PARGR which gives wrong results on the SUNS. (11/6/87 Valdes)

    The package was reorganized to put algorithm procedures in the subdirectory
    asttools.  A README file describes the contents of this directory.

    New tasks ASTTIMES and RVCORRECT have been added for computing astronomical
    dates and times and radial velocity corrections.  Tools used by these
    tasks were added to the asttools library.
    (10/29/87)

noao$astutil/precess.x
    Replaced use of preces.f with new ast_precess.x.  This also involved
    changing years to double precession internally. (10/28/87 Valdes)

noao$astutil/Revisions
    Valdes, May 26, 1987
    1.  Revisions file started.

    Lytle, May 28, 1987
    2. Installed PDM in astutil.
