astutil$setairmass.par
astutil$t_setairmass.x
    The task now precesses the coordinates to the epoch of the
    observation.  (2/2/90, Seaman)

astutil$astutil.hd
    The path to the sources to PDM was not defined correctly.
    Changed src=pdm/t_pdm.x to src=pdm$t_pdm.x. (1/28/90 Lytle)

astutil$mkpkg
astutil$astutil.cl
astutil$astutil.men
astutil$astutil.hd
    Added a new task to compute and update airmass and universal time
    in image headers based on the exposure.  (5/19/89, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The leap year was not handled correctly for the centuries in
    ast_day_of_year.  (5/11/89, Valdes)

astutil$rvcorrect.par
astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
astutil$doc/rvcorrect.hlp
     Added 'imupdate' parameter to make updating image headers with
     computed corrections an option.  (5/5/89, Fitzpatrick)

astutil$galactic.x
astutil$galactic.par
astutil$doc/galactic.hlp
astutil$asttools/astgaltoeq.x +
    GALACTIC now can transform in either direction.  (2/14/89, Valdes)

noao$astutil/t_rvcorrect.x
noao$astutil/doc/rvcorrect.hlp
    Changed the keywords and output when using images.  The observed
    velocity must now be VOBS.  The output is HJD, VHELIO, VLSR, and
    VSUN (a record of the Sun's velocity used for VLSR).  (12/14/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/asttools/ast_galactic.x
    The galactic task was not precessing the input coordinates before
    computing the galactic coordinates.

    I changed the single precision defined constants to double precision
    and the in line constant 15 to 15.0d0.
    (9/15/88 Davis)

noao$astutil/astvorbit.x
noao$astutil/astvbary.x
noao$astutil/asthjd.x
    The calls to AST_COORD needed double precision arguments.  (7/26/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/astutil.cl
    Added OBSERVATORY task to this package.  (4/12/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/galactic.x
    The double precision variables lii and bii where being printed with
    PARGR which gives wrong results on the SUNS. (11/6/87 Valdes)

    The package was reorganized to put algorithm procedures in the subdirectory
    asttools.  A README file describes the contents of this directory.

    New tasks ASTTIMES and RVCORRECT have been added for computing astronomical
    dates and times and radial velocity corrections.  Tools used by these
    tasks were added to the asttools library.
    (10/29/87)

noao$astutil/precess.x
    Replaced use of preces.f with new ast_precess.x.  This also involved
    changing years to double precession internally. (10/28/87 Valdes)
