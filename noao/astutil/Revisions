astutil$t_obs.x
astutil$t_asttimes.x
astutil$observatory.par
    Modified to allow non-integer timezones.  (12/29/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_setjd.x
    Added an extra digit to the printed output to give times to a second.
    (6/4/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_asthedit.x
    Modified this to use the evvexpr package rather than the evexpr package
    since the former includes double precision datatypes necessary to
    maintain precision on some astronomical quantities.  (4/22/94, Valdes)

astutil$ccddb.x
astutil$doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.	The code would not work with database entries containing whitespace.
    2.	The help was not correct in describing how the number of pixels used
	in the photometry is calculated from the seeing FWHM.
    (4/5/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_ccdtime.x
    Modified CCDTIME to use a plate scale instead of the f/ratio and to
    include an airmass term.  (10/23/93, Valdes)

astutil$mkpkg
astutil$asttools/mkpkg
    The ASTTOOLS routines are now an NOAO package library which can be
    referenced as -lasttools.  (8/19/93, Valdes)

astutil$ccddb.x		+
astutil$ccdtime.x	-
astutil$ccdtime.par
astutil$doc/ccdtime.hlp
astutil$astutil.men
astutil$mkpkg
    Revised CCDTIME to use a telescope/filter/detector database and to
    compute and print additional information.  (8/16/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    1.	The times are now always printed in the proper 24 hour interval.
    2.	Also the fix to asttimes.x fixes incorrect values produced around
	the new year.
    3.  The header parameter also suppress printing the observatory info.
	(5/27/93, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The epoch was changed from day of the year divided by 365.25 to the
    precise J2000 Julian epoch definition.  This also has the effect
    of fixing incorrect values of JD and LMST around the new year.
    (5/27/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
astutil$keywpars.par		+
astutil$doc/keywpars.hlp	+
    Added a pset KEYWPARS which is a duplicate of the RV package version,
    updated the RVCORRECT task to make use of this instead of using hard-
    wired image header keywords.  Previously it was possible that the astutil
    version of RVCORRECT would compute a heliocentric correction different
    from what was found by the RV package when working from image headers.
    Eventually other tasks should be modified to make use of this pset.
    (5/12/93, MJF)

astutil$t_asthedit.x
astutil$asthedit.par
astutil$doc/asthedit.hlp
astutil$x_astutil.x
astutil$astutil.cl
astutil$astutil.men
astutil$astutil.hd
    ASTHEDIT is a new task which edits image headers of astronomical images.
    In includes functions for airmass, astronomical times, precession, etc.
    (3/30/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
    A typo in the clgstr call in the rvc_images procedure resulted in the
    input observatory name being truncated at 2 characters.  Instead
    of TY_CHAR for the lenght of the string it needs to be SZ_FNAME.

    1.  Changed the default action to update the image headers.
    2.  Added an update field to the show listing.
    3.  A warning is printed if show=no and update=no since this is a noop.
    (11/5/91, Valdes)

astutil$t_setairmass.x
    The hour angle was slightly incorrect because universal time, from
    the exposure time, was used instead of siderial time in computing the
    midpoint.  (8/26/91, Seaman)

astutil$asttools/*.x
    Coerced all constants with many significant digits to double precision.
    (6/24/91, Valdes)

astutil$astutil.cl
astutil$astutil.men
astutil$astutil.hd
    1.  A new version of the observatory task based on an observatory database
    using the new interface obsdb.x in xtools was added to the astutil
    executable.
    2.  The observatory help was revised and moved to astutil.
    3.  The observatory task itself is defined in noao and was removed
    from the astutil package definitions.
    (11/6/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    Added a modulus operations to convert any zone to the range -12 to 12.
    (9/28/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    Changed the procedure times to ast_times to avoid a name conflict in the
    HPUX port.  This is a better name anyway.  (9/8/90, Valdes)

astutil$asttimes.par
    Removed the range limits on the zone.  Zones east of Greenwich need to
    be negative to obtain the correct dates.  (6/15/90, Valdes)

astutil$doc/galactic.hlp
    Corrected comment about epoch of galactic coordinates.  Added an example
    showing how to get galactic coordinates for images containing
    equitorial coordinates.  (5/23/90, Valdes)

    Added a new task to compute and update airmass and universal time
    in image headers based on the exposure.  (5/19/89, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The leap year was not handled correctly for the centuries in
    ast_day_of_year.  (5/11/89, Valdes)

astutil$rvcorrect.par
astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
astutil$doc/rvcorrect.hlp
     Added 'imupdate' parameter to make updating image headers with
     computed corrections an option.  (5/5/89, Fitzpatrick)

astutil$galactic.x
astutil$galactic.par

noao$astutil/t_rvcorrect.x
noao$astutil/doc/rvcorrect.hlp
    Changed the keywords and output when using images.  The observed
    velocity must now be VOBS.  The output is HJD, VHELIO, VLSR, and
    VSUN (a record of the Sun's velocity used for VLSR).  (12/14/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/asttools/ast_galactic.x
    The galactic task was not precessing the input coordinates before
    computing the galactic coordinates.

    I changed the single precision defined constants to double precision
    and the in line constant 15 to 15.0d0.
    (9/15/88 Davis)

noao$astutil/astvorbit.x
noao$astutil/astvbary.x
noao$astutil/asthjd.x
    The calls to AST_COORD needed double precision arguments.  (7/26/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/astutil.cl
    Added OBSERVATORY task to this package.  (4/12/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/galactic.x
    The double precision variables lii and bii where being printed with
    PARGR which gives wrong results on the SUNS. (11/6/87 Valdes)

    The package was reorganized to put algorithm procedures in the subdirectory
    asttools.  A README file describes the contents of this directory.

    New tasks ASTTIMES and RVCORRECT have been added for computing astronomical
    dates and times and radial velocity corrections.  Tools used by these
    tasks were added to the asttools library.
    (10/29/87)

noao$astutil/precess.x
    Replaced use of preces.f with new ast_precess.x.  This also involved
    changing years to double precession internally. (10/28/87 Valdes)
