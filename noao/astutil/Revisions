t_astcalc.x
doc/astcalc.hlp
    The $D variable was changed from the old MM/DD/YY format to the post-Y2K
    YYYY-MM-DD format.  (4/6/10, MJF)

asttools/refrac.x
    A development routine for refraction correction from apparent to
    observed place.  As noted in the comments, this seems to be correct
    to first order but I don't have complete confidence that I've done
    this correctly.  It would be useful to have an independent test.
    (7/2/08, Valdes)

t_rvcorrect.x
    If a UT time is part of the date keyword it is used in preference to
    the UT keyword.  This makes use of UTMIDDLE, with the previous change,
    consistent.  (12/10/07, Valdes)

t_setairmass.x
    The UTMIDDLE keyword will now always be in date format.  This fixes
    a problem with changes of the date and insures other tasks which
    use UTMIDDLE in place of DATE-OBS will used the correct time.

    CCDTIME was moved to the OBSUTIL package in V2.12.  But the version in
    ASTUTIL was retained.  The change here was to have the ASTUTIL version
    point to the OBSUTIL version so that there is only one source,
    parameter file, and executable.  (4/28/03, Valdes)

t_rvcorrect.x
    If imupdate=no then the image is now opened READ_ONLY.  Previously
    the image was always opened READ_WRITE requiring the user to have
    write permission on the image.  (12/14/01, Valdes)

t_setairmass.x
    Previously if DATE-OBS included the UT then that time was used and
    it was not possible to specify an alternate UT.  Now the UT keyword
    has precedence over DATE-OBS.  To allow the keyword for UT to point
    to DATE-OBS for the time the UT keyword may be specified in either
    data/time format or as hours.

    The UTMIDDLE output option will now be written in the same format as
    the keyword used for the input UT.

    (9/20/01, Valdes)

pdm/pdmtheta.x
    The procedure that bins the data would compute negative bins leading
    to memory corruption when the input x values are not sorted.  I made
    a fix to this which solves the immediate problem.  I didn't figure
    out the code enough to know if there is any other assumption about the
    input data being sorted.  (2/22/01, Valdes)

t_rvcorrect.x
    Task now checks if a file specified in the "files" parameter is actually
    and image and prints a warning.  See buglog 477.  (1/31/01, Valdes)

pdm/TODO	+
    Added a TODO file for suggestions for further work.

    The image header keyword parameters ra, dec, equinox, st, ut,
    and the scale height parameter were added to the setairmass task. In
    the previous version of the task ra, dec, equinox, st and ut were
    hardwired to "RA", "DEC", "EPOCH", "ST", and "UT", and the scale
    parameter was hardwired to 750.0. (10/31/00, Davis)

t_ccdtime.x
doc/ccdtime.hlp
    It is now an error if time<0, time>10-000, abs(mag)>40, snr<0 or
    snr>100000.  (8/24/00, Valdes)

astfunc.x
    There was a typo in the opcode for CLPUT.  It was 10 instead of 20.
    This resulted in not branching to the I/O function evaluator and
    giving a "requires 1 argument" error.
    (6/29/00, Valdes)

doc/setairmass.hlp
    Made it clear that DATE-OBS means UT date.  (6/21/00, Valdes)

t_setairmass.x
    Moved erract call before imunmap to avoid an incorrect error string
    (about isodate) being printed.  (10/21/99, Valdes)

astfunc.x
t_rvcorrect.x
    Added missing time.h dependencies.  (10/11/99, Valdes)

asttools/mkpkg
    Added missing dependency for astgalactic.x.  (10/11/99, Valdes)

t_astcalc.x
    There was an extra READ_ONLY immap when processing a list of images.
    Therefore when using a long list of STF format images where a file
    descriptor is opened and not closed until imunmap it was possible to
    run out of file descriptors.  This was not a problem with imh
    or fits formats.  (8/31/99, Valdes)

t_rvcorrect.x
astfunc.x
    The dates in old FITS format incorrectly are adding 1900 to the year
    where the 1900 is already added by the parsing routine.

    The epoch, julday, and mst functions now take either the old or new
    FITS style date strings.  The time argument is optional and if it is
    not specified the time from the date string is used and if neither time
    is present a value of 0h is used.  New internal variables $GMD, $GMT,
    and $GMDT for the current time Greenwich time are defined.

    (5/19/99, Valdes)

asttools/*
    All routines checked for Y2K correctness.  No changes were required.
    The README file had the following statement added:

    Y2K:
	Most routines work in Julian days or epochs.  If they have an input
	year it is converted to one of these forms by calling
	ast_date_to_julday.  This is the only routine that has a Y2K
	connection.  It assumes two digit years are 20th century.  These
	routines are Y2K correct.

    (5/19/99, Valdes)

doc/pdm.hlp
    Added a journal reference to the algorithm.  (4/26/99, Valdes)

    (3/9/99, Valdes)

t_rvcorrect.x
    Improved error catching.  (3/5/99, Valdes)

t_rvcorrect.x
    Added code the catch a bad DATE-OBS keyword and print an informative
    error (2/21/99 MJF)

t_ccdtime.x
    For the case where SNR is very large and a time is specified the
    iteration on the magnitude might not complete.  The iteration is now
    capped at 100 and the test for convergence is now normalized.
    (11/6/98, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x
doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.  The calculation of exposure time given a SNR was changed from an
	interative solution to an analytic solution.
    2.  The times are printed to 0.01s.
    3.  The photometry aperture is now the rounded-up integer with a minimum
	of 9 pixels.
    (9/8/98, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x
ccddb.x
doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.	The database keywords can now be index by reference to the telescope,
	filter, and/or telescope.
    2.  A new filter keyword, "extinction", was added to specify the
	extinction.
    3.	The extinction is now used to fixe the previous incorrect behavior
	that used 1 mag/airmass extinction.  The old results are preserved
	by making the default extinction be 1 if missing.  However the
	database files should be updated to have correct extinctions.
    (8/19/98, Valdes)

rvcorrect.par
        Removed the KEYPARS pset from the parameter file.  The pset is
        still available to the task, but it's presence interferes with
        the task when used in CL mode since the 'ut' parameter is no
        longer queried and the pset value is used, resulting in an 
        illegal number error when getting the value (4/22/98 MJF)

t_setjd.x
    The ctod function was incorrectly declared double.  (3/10/98, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.1
=======

pdm/pdmdelete.x
    The statement "r2min = MAX_DOUBLE" was changed to "r2min=MAX_REAL"

    1.	The theta calculation was incorrect when there is less than 100 input
	data points.  In that case overlapping bins are used and the
	calculation failed to account for this.
    2.  Removed the debug option.
    3.  Updated help including documentation of the "pluspoint" parameter.
    (10/1/96, Valdes)

t_setjd.x
setjd.hlp
    Improved error checking and interpretation of the epoch keyword.
    If an epoch keyword is specified and the keyword is not found
    or can't be interpreted it is an error.  If the epoch is an unlikely
    value a warning is printed.  If the epoch begins with B or J (case
    insensitive) that is ok.  (8/30/96, Valdes)

rvcorrect.par

    A new task, ASTCALC, was written that uses a greatly enhanced syntax
    from that of the original t_asthedit.  It includes assignment statements,
    simple conditional statements, and expressions without assignment.
    Variables are implemented with a symbol table.  Image, text file,
    and CL parameter I/O is done with function calls in the
    expression evaluator.
    (1/24/96, Valdes)

t_asthedit.x

mkpkg
doc/asthedit.hlp
    The task ASTHEDIT was revised to use a greatly enhanced syntax.  
    Internally it is significantly different but functionally it
    is similar.  A new parameter, update, was added to allow images
    to be used which are read-only or not to be modified.  The
    task allows a null image list so that it can be used as a calculator.
    (1/24/96, Valdes)

astfunc.x	+
astfunc.h	+
    The function evaluator from t_asthedit.x was extracted to a separate
    file.  The set of functions was increased, primarily with the
    addition of I/O functions for printing, imio, fio, clio, fmtio,
    and errors.  These functions are organized in a subfunction
    procedure. (1/24/96, Valdes)

astutil$t_setjd.x
    Added an extra digit to the printed output to give times to a second.
    (6/4/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_asthedit.x
    Modified this to use the evvexpr package rather than the evexpr package
    since the former includes double precision datatypes necessary to
    maintain precision on some astronomical quantities.  (4/22/94, Valdes)

astutil$ccddb.x
astutil$doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.	The code would not work with database entries containing whitespace.
    2.	The help was not correct in describing how the number of pixels used
	in the photometry is calculated from the seeing FWHM.
    (4/5/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_ccdtime.x
    Modified CCDTIME to use a plate scale instead of the f/ratio and to
    include an airmass term.  (10/23/93, Valdes)

astutil$mkpkg

    Revised CCDTIME to use a telescope/filter/detector database and to
    compute and print additional information.  (8/16/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    1.	The times are now always printed in the proper 24 hour interval.
    2.	Also the fix to asttimes.x fixes incorrect values produced around
	the new year.
    3.  The header parameter also suppress printing the observatory info.
	(5/27/93, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The epoch was changed from day of the year divided by 365.25 to the
    precise J2000 Julian epoch definition.  This also has the effect
    of fixing incorrect values of JD and LMST around the new year.

astutil$doc/keywpars.hlp	+
    Added a pset KEYWPARS which is a duplicate of the RV package version,
    updated the RVCORRECT task to make use of this instead of using hard-
    wired image header keywords.  Previously it was possible that the astutil
    version of RVCORRECT would compute a heliocentric correction different
    from what was found by the RV package when working from image headers.
    Eventually other tasks should be modified to make use of this pset.

    (3/30/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
    A typo in the clgstr call in the rvc_images procedure resulted in the
    input observatory name being truncated at 2 characters.  Instead
    of TY_CHAR for the lenght of the string it needs to be SZ_FNAME.
