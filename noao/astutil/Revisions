pdm/pdmdelete.x
    The statement "r2min = MAX_DOUBLE" was changed to "r2min=MAX_REAL"
    since r2min is declared and used as real.  (10/6/97, Valdes)

pdm.par
    1.	The theta calculation was incorrect when there is less than 100 input
	data points.  In that case overlapping bins are used and the
	calculation failed to account for this.
    2.  Removed the debug option.
    3.  Updated help including documentation of the "pluspoint" parameter.
    (10/1/96, Valdes)

t_setjd.x
setjd.hlp
    Improved error checking and interpretation of the epoch keyword.
    If an epoch keyword is specified and the keyword is not found
    or can't be interpreted it is an error.  If the epoch is an unlikely
    value a warning is printed.  If the epoch begins with B or J (case
    insensitive) that is ok.  (8/30/96, Valdes)

rvcorrect.par
doc/rvcorrect.par
	Forgot to add the keywpars pset declaration.  (8/26/96  MJF)

astfunc.x
    Added btoi function "iresult = btoi (O_VALC(args[1])=='y'..."

    A new script task, ASTRADIUS, was written that is based on ASTCALC.
    It finds and prints all images from an image list that have coordinates
    within a specified radius of a specified coordinate.  (1/24/96, Valdes)

    A new task, ASTCALC, was written that uses a greatly enhanced syntax
    from that of the original t_asthedit.  It includes assignment statements,
    simple conditional statements, and expressions without assignment.
    Variables are implemented with a symbol table.  Image, text file,
    and CL parameter I/O is done with function calls in the
    expression evaluator.
    (1/24/96, Valdes)

t_asthedit.x
asthedit.par
mkpkg
doc/asthedit.hlp
    The task ASTHEDIT was revised to use a greatly enhanced syntax.  
    Internally it is significantly different but functionally it
    is similar.  A new parameter, update, was added to allow images
    to be used which are read-only or not to be modified.  The
    task allows a null image list so that it can be used as a calculator.
    (1/24/96, Valdes)

astfunc.x	+
astfunc.h	+
    The function evaluator from t_asthedit.x was extracted to a separate
    file.  The set of functions was increased, primarily with the
    addition of I/O functions for printing, imio, fio, clio, fmtio,
    and errors.  These functions are organized in a subfunction
    procedure. (1/24/96, Valdes)

airmass.x
t_setairmass.x
    Moved the airmass procedure from t_setairmass.x to airmass.x.
    (1/23/96, Valdes)

astutil$t_obs.x
astutil$t_asttimes.x
astutil$observatory.par
    Modified to allow non-integer timezones.  (12/29/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_setjd.x
    Added an extra digit to the printed output to give times to a second.
    (6/4/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_asthedit.x
    Modified this to use the evvexpr package rather than the evexpr package
    since the former includes double precision datatypes necessary to
    maintain precision on some astronomical quantities.  (4/22/94, Valdes)

astutil$ccddb.x
astutil$doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.	The code would not work with database entries containing whitespace.
    2.	The help was not correct in describing how the number of pixels used
	in the photometry is calculated from the seeing FWHM.
    (4/5/94, Valdes)

astutil$t_ccdtime.x
    Modified CCDTIME to use a plate scale instead of the f/ratio and to
    include an airmass term.  (10/23/93, Valdes)

astutil$mkpkg
astutil$asttools/mkpkg
    The ASTTOOLS routines are now an NOAO package library which can be
    referenced as -lasttools.  (8/19/93, Valdes)

    Revised CCDTIME to use a telescope/filter/detector database and to
    compute and print additional information.  (8/16/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    1.	The times are now always printed in the proper 24 hour interval.
    2.	Also the fix to asttimes.x fixes incorrect values produced around
	the new year.
    3.  The header parameter also suppress printing the observatory info.
	(5/27/93, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The epoch was changed from day of the year divided by 365.25 to the
    precise J2000 Julian epoch definition.  This also has the effect
    of fixing incorrect values of JD and LMST around the new year.
    (5/27/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
astutil$keywpars.par		+
astutil$doc/keywpars.hlp	+
    Added a pset KEYWPARS which is a duplicate of the RV package version,
    updated the RVCORRECT task to make use of this instead of using hard-
    wired image header keywords.  Previously it was possible that the astutil
    version of RVCORRECT would compute a heliocentric correction different
    from what was found by the RV package when working from image headers.
    Eventually other tasks should be modified to make use of this pset.

    ASTHEDIT is a new task which edits image headers of astronomical images.
    In includes functions for airmass, astronomical times, precession, etc.
    (3/30/93, Valdes)

astutil$t_rvcorrect.x
    A typo in the clgstr call in the rvc_images procedure resulted in the
    input observatory name being truncated at 2 characters.  Instead
    of TY_CHAR for the lenght of the string it needs to be SZ_FNAME.

    1.  Changed the default action to update the image headers.
    2.  Added an update field to the show listing.
    3.  A warning is printed if show=no and update=no since this is a noop.
    (11/5/91, Valdes)

astutil$t_setairmass.x
    The hour angle was slightly incorrect because universal time, from
    the exposure time, was used instead of siderial time in computing the
    midpoint.  (8/26/91, Seaman)

astutil$asttools/*.x
    Coerced all constants with many significant digits to double precision.
    (6/24/91, Valdes)

    1.  A new version of the observatory task based on an observatory database
    using the new interface obsdb.x in xtools was added to the astutil
    executable.
    2.  The observatory help was revised and moved to astutil.
    3.  The observatory task itself is defined in noao and was removed
    from the astutil package definitions.
    (11/6/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    Added a modulus operations to convert any zone to the range -12 to 12.
    (9/28/90, Valdes)

astutil$t_asttimes.x
    Changed the procedure times to ast_times to avoid a name conflict in the
    HPUX port.  This is a better name anyway.  (9/8/90, Valdes)

astutil$asttimes.par
    Removed the range limits on the zone.  Zones east of Greenwich need to
    be negative to obtain the correct dates.  (6/15/90, Valdes)

astutil$doc/galactic.hlp
    Corrected comment about epoch of galactic coordinates.  Added an example
    showing how to get galactic coordinates for images containing
    equitorial coordinates.  (5/23/90, Valdes)

astutil$asttools/asttimes.x
    The leap year was not handled correctly for the centuries in
    ast_day_of_year.  (5/11/89, Valdes)

astutil$rvcorrect.par
astutil$t_rvcorrect.x

noao$astutil/t_rvcorrect.x
noao$astutil/doc/rvcorrect.hlp
    Changed the keywords and output when using images.  The observed
    velocity must now be VOBS.  The output is HJD, VHELIO, VLSR, and
    VSUN (a record of the Sun's velocity used for VLSR).  (12/14/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/asttools/ast_galactic.x
    The galactic task was not precessing the input coordinates before
    computing the galactic coordinates.

    I changed the single precision defined constants to double precision
    and the in line constant 15 to 15.0d0.
    (9/15/88 Davis)

noao$astutil/astvorbit.x
noao$astutil/astvbary.x
noao$astutil/asthjd.x
    The calls to AST_COORD needed double precision arguments.  (7/26/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/astutil.cl
    Added OBSERVATORY task to this package.  (4/12/88 Valdes)

noao$astutil/galactic.x
    The double precision variables lii and bii where being printed with
    PARGR which gives wrong results on the SUNS. (11/6/87 Valdes)

    The package was reorganized to put algorithm procedures in the subdirectory
    asttools.  A README file describes the contents of this directory.

    New tasks ASTTIMES and RVCORRECT have been added for computing astronomical
    dates and times and radial velocity corrections.  Tools used by these
    tasks were added to the asttools library.
    (10/29/87)

noao$astutil/precess.x
    Replaced use of preces.f with new ast_precess.x.  This also involved
    changing years to double precession internally. (10/28/87 Valdes)
