DESCRIPTION
The observed radial velocity is corrected for the motion of the
observer in the direction of the observation.  The components of the
observer's motion corrected are those due to the Earth's rotation
(diurnal velocity), the motion of the Earth's center about the
Earth-Moon barycenter (lunar velocity), the motion of the Earth-Moon
barycenter about the center of the Sun (annual velocity), and the
motion of the Sun (solar velocity) relative to some specified standard
of rest.

The input parameters consist of the date and time of the observation, the
direction of observation, the location of the observation, the direction
and magnitude of the solar motion relative to some standard of rest, and
the observed radial velocity.  In all cases years between 0 and 99 are
treated as 20th century years.  The observatory for the observations
defaults to that specified by the environment variable "observatory" if
defined or that set for the task \fBobservatory\fR.  If the input consists
of images the observatory is defined by the OBSERVAT image header parameter
if present.  See \fBovservatory\fR for additional information.  The solar
motion defaults to that relative to the galactic local standard of rest
(LSR).  Note that one can make the local standard of rest velocity be
equivalent to the heliocentric velocity by setting the velocity of the
solar motion to zero.

The observed velocity, date, time, and direction of observation may be
specified in three ways; from files, images, or the task parameters.  If a
list of files is given then the files are read for the observation
parameters.  The format of the files is lines containing the year, month
(as an integer), day, universal time, right ascension, declination,
(optional) coordinate epoch, and (optional) observed radial velocity.  If
no file list is specified but a list of images is given then the
observation parameters are determined from the image header parameters
specified through the keywpars parameters.  If the observation date
includes the time then it is used in preference to universal time keyword.
Finally, if no list of files or images is given then the task parameters
are used.  If no observed radial velocity is given in the file list or
found in the image header then a value of zero is assumed.  In this case
the corrected velocities are interpreted as the corrections to be added to
a measured velocity to correct to the desired standard of rest.

The results of the radial velocity calculations are output in three
ways.  The velocities are always printed on the standard output with an
optional header.  If the observation parameters are set with the task
parameters (no file or image list) then the results are also stored in
the parameter file.  This mechanism allows the task to be used easily
in a script and to obtain greater precision.  If the observation
parameters are taken from the image headers and the \fIimupdate\fR
parameter is set, then the heliocentric
Julian day is recorded as HJD, the heliocentric velocity as VHELIO,
the LSR velocity as VLSR, and the velocity, ra and dec, and epoch
of the solar motion used in VLSR is recorded as VSUN.

The printed output may include the input data if desired.  This produces two
lines per observation, one for the input data and one for the output
velocities.  The calculated data consists of the heliocentric Julian
date, the observed velocity, the observed heliocentric velocity, and
the observed local standard of rest velocity.  Following this are
component corrections for the diurnal, lunar, annual, and solar
velocities.
.ih
DIURNAL VELOCITY
The geodetic latitude to geocentric latitude correction is given by

.nf
	dlat = -(11. * 60. + 32.743000) * sin (2*lat) +
		1.163300 * sin (4*lat) - 0.002600 * sin (6*lat)
.fi

where lat is the geodetic latitude and dlat is the additive correction.
The distance, r, of the observer from the Earth's center in meters is given by

.nf
	r = 6378160.0 * (0.998327073 + 0.00167643800 * cos(2*lat) -
	    0.00000351 * cos(4*lat) + 0.000000008 * cos(6*lat)) +
	    altitude
.fi

where lat is the corrected latitude and altitude is the altitude above
sea level.  The rotational velocity (perpendicular to the radius vector)
in km/s is given by

	v = TWOPI * (r / 1000.)  / (23.934469591229 * 3600.)

where 23.934469591229 is the sidereal day in hours for 1986 and TWOPI is the
ratio of the circumference to the radius of a circle.  The projection of
this velocity along the line of sight is

	vdiurnal = v * cos (lat) * cos (dec) * sin (ra-lmst)

where lmst is the local mean sidereal time.
.ih
BARYCENTRIC VELOCITY
The orbital elements of the lunar orbit are computed from the following
interpolation formulas

.nf
	t = (JD - 2415020) / 36525.

	oblq = 23.452294-t*(0.0130125+t*(0.00000164-t*0.000000503))
	omega = 259.183275-t*(1934.142008+t*(0.002078+t*0.000002))
	mlong = 270.434164+t*(481267.88315+t*(-0.001133+t*0.0000019))-
	    omega
	lperi = 334.329556+t*(4069.034029-t*(0.010325+t*0.000012))-
	    omega
	em = 0.054900489
	inclin = 5.1453964
.fi

where t is the time from the Julian day 2415020 (~J1900) in Julian centuries,
oblq is the mean obliquity of the ecliptic, omega is the longitude of the mean
ascending node, mlong is the mean lunar longitude, lperi is the mean lunar
longitude of perigee, em is the eccentricity of the lunar orbit, and inclin
is the inclination of the orbit to the ecliptic.  The true lunar longitude,
tlong, is computed from the mean longitude using the correction for the mean
anomaly to the true anomaly (radians)

.nf
	manom = mlong - lperi
	tanom = manom + (2 * em - 0.25 * em**3) * sin (manom) +
	    1.25 * em**2 * sin (2 * manom) + 13/12 * em**3 *
	    sin (3 * manom)
	tlong = tanom + lperi
.fi

The velocity of the Moon around the Earth's center in the plane of the orbit
in km/s is

.nf
	vmoon = (TWOPI * 384403.12040) / (27.321661 * 86400) /
	    sqrt (1. - em**2)
.fi

where 384403.12040 is the mean lunar distance (km) and 27.321661 is the mean
lunar month (days).  The component along the line to the observation is

	v = vmoon * cos (bm) * (sin (tlong-lm) - em*sin (lperi-lm))

where lm and bm are the longitude and latitude of the observation
along the lunar orbital plane relative to the ascending node using a standard
coordinate transformation.  The barycentric velocity is that reduced by
the ratio of the Earth's mass to the Moon's mass.

	vlunar = v / 81.53
.ih
ANNUAL VELOCITY
The orbital elements of the Earth's orbit are computed from the following
interpolation formulas

.nf
	t = (ast_julday (epoch) - 2415020) / 36525.

	manom = 358.47583+t*(35999.04975-t*(0.000150+t*0.000003))
	oblq = 23.452294-t*(0.0130125+t*(0.00000164-t*0.000000503))
	lperi = 101.22083+t*(1.7191733+t*(0.000453+t*0.000003))
	eccen = 0.01675104-t*(0.00004180+t*0.000000126)
.fi

where t is the time from the Julian day 2415020 (~J1900) in Julian centuries,
manom is the mean anomaly (degrees), oblq is the mean obliquity of the ecliptic
(degrees), lperi is the mean longitude of perihelion (degrees), and
eccen is the eccentricity of the orbit.  The true anomaly (radians) is 
obtained from the mean anomaly (radians) by

.nf
	tanom = manom + (2 * eccen - 0.25 * eccen**3) * sin (manom) +
	    1.25 * eccen**2 * sin (2 * manom) +
	    13./12. * eccen**3 * sin (3 * manom)
.fi

The orbital velocity of the Earth-Moon barycenter perpendicular to
the radius vector is given by

.nf
	v = ((TWOPI * 149598500.) / (365.2564 * 86400.)) /
	    sqrt (1. - eccen**2)
.fi

where the semi-major axis is 149598500 km and the year is 365.2564 days.
To compute the projection of this velocity along the line of observation
the direction of observation (precessed to the epoch of observation)
is converted into ecliptic latitude and
longitude, l and b, measured from the point of the ascending node using
a standard spherical coordinate transformation.  The component is then

	vannual = v * cos(b) * (sin(slong-l) - eccen*sin(lperi-l))

where the longitude of the Sun as seen from the Earth, slong, is given by

	slong = lperi + tanom + 180
.ih
SOLAR MOTION
The solar motion is computed by precessing the coordinates of the solar
motion to the observation epoch and taking the appropriate component
along the line of sight.
.ih
ACCURACY
The calculations are done using IRAF double precision.
No correction is made for the perturbation of the other planets.  The
precession does not include nutation.  The interpolation formulas are
only approximations.  The accuracy of the heliocentric
velocity are better than a 0.005 of a kilometer per second.
Relative velocities over short intervals are even better.
.ih
EXAMPLES
1. For use directly without data files or images there are two common modes.
Because of the large number of parameters the parameter values are often
set using the task \fBeparam\fR.  Then simply execute the command

.nf
	cl> rvcorrect
.fi

2. To set some of the parameters on the command line

.nf
	cl> rvcorrect ra=12:22:1.116 dec=15:55:16.244 ut=5:30
.fi

3. To use a text file generate a file containing the year, month, day, ut,
ra, and dec with one observation per line.

4. To use observation parameters from a set of images the command is

.nf
	cl> rvcorrect images=hz44.001,aboo.001 > rv.dat
.fi

5. A CL loop can be used to compute a table in which one parameter varies.

.nf
	cl> for (x=0.; x<=12.; x=x+1)
	>>> rvcorrect (ut=x, header=no)
.fi

6. To get the total velocity correction in a script the following may be done.

.nf
	rvcorrect (vobs=12.3, ra=12:33, dec=30:22, ut=5:30, > "dev$null")
	vlsr = rvcorrect.vlsr
.fi

Note that this does not work when the task is run as a background job!
