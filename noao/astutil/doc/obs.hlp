NAME
observatory -- Examine and set observatory parameters
.ih
USAGE
observatory command obsid [images]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls command = "list" (set|list|images)
Command option which is one of "set", "list", or "images".  The set command
sets the default observatory task parameters for the specified
observatory.  The list command lists the observatory parameters for the
specified observatory but does not modify the task parameters.  The images
command lists the observatory parameters for a list of images.  The list
and images commands examine and verify the observatory parameters applied
by other tasks using the observatory database facility.
.le
.ls obsid = "?"
Observatory identification to be set, listed, or used as the default for
images without the OBSERVAT keyword.  The observatory ID is one of those in
the database (case ignored), the special string "observatory" to default to
the environment variable "observatory" or the \fIobservatory.observatory\fR
parameter, "obspars" to select the parameters in the \fBobservatory\fR
task, or "?" to list the observatories defined in the database.
.le
.ls images
List of images to be examined with the "images" command.  The images are
checked for the OBSERVAT keyword to determine the observatory parameters
to be listed, otherwise the observatory given by \fIobsid\fR is used.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Verbose output?  Because there are a number of different ways in which
observatory information is determine this option prints detailed
information on how the observatory database and parameters are
ultimately selected.
.le

.ls observatory
The default observatory used by tasks which use the special
observatory identification "observatory".  The value is one of the
observatory names in the observatory database (case ignored)
or the special value "obspars" to select the parameters defined in this
task.  There is no default to force users to set it at least once.
.le
.ls name
Observatory name.
.le
.ls longitude
Observatory longitude given in degrees west.
.le
.ls latitude
Observatory latitude in degrees.  Positive latitudes are north and negative
latitudes are south.
.le
.ls altitude
Observatory altitude in meters above sea level.
.le
.ls timezone
Observatory time zone.  The time zone is the number of hours west of
Greenwich or the number of hours to be added to local time to obtain
Greenwich time.
.le
.ih
ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.ls obsdb
This variable selects the observatory database.  If not defined it defaults
to noao$lib/obsdb.dat.
.le
.ls observatory
This variable selects the observatory entry whenever a task uses the
observatory name "observatory".  If not defined the value of the task
parameter \fIobservatory.observatory\fR is used.
.le
.ih
IMAGE HEADER KEYWORDS
The observatory identification for images is first sought under the
image header keyword OBSERVAT.  This always takes precedence over any
other means of defining the observatory.

DESCRIPTION

OBSERVATORY PARAMETERS IN THE NOAO PACKAGE

Some astronomical data reduction and analysis tasks perform
computations requiring information about where the data was observed.
For example a number of \fBnoao\fR tasks make corrections for the
airmass.  Generally they look for an airmass in the image header and
if it is not present they attempt to compute it from other image header
parameters.  The information about time and telescope coordinates
of the observation are often in the image header but the observatory
latitude is not.  The task must get this information somehow.

Prior to IRAF V2.10 tasks generally had explicit parameters, such as
latitude, with default values pointing (using parameter redirection) to
the parameter of the same name in the \fBobservatory\fR task.  The
user was required to know the values of the observatory parameters and
manually change them for data from different observatories.  In V2.10
an observatory database has been implemented.  Observatory parameters
are stored in a simple text file and tasks obtain observatory related
parameters by specifying an observatory identification.

In general the information about the observatory should be directly
associated with the image data.  Unless stated otherwise in the
description of a task,  tasks which require observatory information
will first look for the image header keyword OBSERVAT.  The value of
this keyword is the observatory identification used to index the
observatory database.  The task will then look up any observatory
parameters it needs in the observatory database.  Data from
observatories that support this keyword will, therefore, always use the
correct observatory parameters without user intervention.  All
observatories which export FITS image data are urged to adopt the
OBSERVAT keyword (a keyword recommended by the FITS standard).

For image data which do not identify the observatory in this way
and in tasks which do not operate on images (such as astronomical
calculator tools), the observatory must be specified by the user.
Most tasks provide an "observatory" parameter which either directly
selects the observatory or use special values for defining the
observatory with an environment variable or the parameters
from the \fBobservatory\fR task.

An observatory is specified by the identification name used in the
observatory database.  The names in the database may be listed using
the \fBobservatory\fR task as described below.  If the desired observatory
is not in the database a user may copy/create their own database and
select it with the environment variable "obsdb", modify the standard
database if allowed (any changes to the distributed version should
be forwarded to iraf$noao.edu), or use the special observatory name
"obspars".  The last option directly uses the parameters in the
\fBobservatory\fR task which can be set to any values using the normal
parameter editing mechanism.

The default value for the observatory parameter in a task is generally
"observatory".  This special name directs the task to look first
for the environment variable of the same name and then at the
\fIobservatory\fR parameter of the \fBobservatory\fR task.  The environment
variable allows users or sites to set the default observatory in their
login files and site defaults.  Also it is simple to change the
default observatory either with a \fBreset\fR command or the
\fBobservatory\fR command.

The observatory database is selected by the environment variable
"obsdb".  The default when the variable is not defined is the
\fBnoao\fR package library database file "noao$lib/obsdb.dat".  The use
of an environment variable allows users to permanently change the
default database in the OS environment (when IRAF has access to it such
as in UNIX systems) or in the startup IRAF environment as set in the
"login.cl" or "loginuser.cl" files.  One can, of course, change it
during a session with the set or reset commands.  For sites which want
to customize the observatory mechanism the environment variables can
also be set and changed in the files "hlib$zzsetenv.def",
"noao$lib/zzsetenv.def", and the template login file "hlib$login.cl".

An observatory database file consist of a simple list of keyword=value
pairs with arbitrary whitespace allowed.  An observatory entry begins
with the observatory keyword and extends to the next observatory
keyword or the end of the file.  The observatory identification should
be the same as the string used in the OBSERVAT image header parameter
for data from that observatory.  The default file noao$lib/obsdb.dat
begins as follows:

.nf
# Observatory Parameters.  Taken from the Almanac.
#
# Observatories wishing to be added or make changes in the default
# distributed database should send information to iraf@noao.edu.

observatory = "kpno"
	name = "Kitt Peak National Observatory"
	longitude = 111:36.0
	latitude = 31:58.8
	altitude = 2120.
	timezone = 7

observatory = "ctio"
	<etc>
.fi

In summary, access to observatory parameters is now done by referencing
the image header keyword OBSERVAT and, if not defined, determine the
observatory name from a task parameter.  The environment variables
"observatory" and "obsdb" can be set by the user to select alternate
observatories and observatory database files.  For data without an
observatory entry the observatory can be set to "obspars" or the user
may make their own observatory database.

THE OBSERVATORY TASK

The \fBobservatory\fR task serves a number of functions.  It may be used to
examine the observatory database, verify the observatory parameters which
will be used by other tasks, particularly those operating on images, set
the default observatory if not defined by other means, set observatory
parameters explicitly, especially when there is no observatory database
entry, and as a parameter set for tasks which explicitly reference
observatory parameters.  The \fBverbose\fR parameter also provides a
detailed check of the steps used to determine the observatory database,
observatory identification, and observatory parameters.

The \fIcommand\fR parameter takes the values "set", "list", or "images".
The \fIobsid\fR parameter supplies the observatory identification and the
\fIimages\fR parameter is used to specify a list of images for the "images"
command.  The parameters are query parameters and so may be either queried
or simply typed on the command line.

The "set" command prints the observatory parameters for the specified
observatory and sets many of these in the \fBobservatory\fR task
parameters.  This command is used to set the default observatory parameters
for tasks where images are not used, the images do not contain the
observatory id, or direct references to specific parameters with parameter
redirection (for example ")observatory.latitude") are used.

The "list" command is similar to the "set" command except the task parameters
are not modified.  It is used to list observatory parameters.  It is also
use with the special observatory identifications to list the entries in
an observatory database and verify the observatory to be used by
tasks which do not operate on images.  The special value "?" lists
the entries in the database.  The special value "observatory" lists
the observatory defined by the "observatory" environment variable or
that given by the \fIobservatory.observatory\fR parameter.  The special
value "obspars" simply lists the observatory task parameters.

The "images" command lists the observatory information applicable to
one or more images.  In particular, the observatory identification is
first sought in OBSERVAT image header keyword and, if not found, the
\fIobsid\fR parameter is used.  Often the default observatory is
"observatory" to follow the same search path used by other tasks.

The \fIverbose\fR parameter prints additional detailed information.  It
prints the database used and whether it is selected by default
(noao$lib/obsdb.dat) or by the "obsdb" environment variable.  When the
observatory is defined as "observatory" it indicates whether the
observatory is defined by the environment variable "observatory" or by the
observatory task.  When listing images it prints the OBSERVAT keyword or
the default observatory assigned.

For observatories not in a database the name, latitude, longitude,
altitude, and time zone parameters may be set using \fBeparam\fR.
The observatory id must be set to "obspars" in this case.
These parameters will then be referenced by other tasks in which
the observatory is specified as "obspars".  This allows arbitrary
observatory parameters to be set without creating or modifying
an observatory database.  However, it is advisable to create a
local database and also send the observatory information to the
IRAF group at NOAO for inclusion in the default database.
