    Davis, April 6, 1990
    Two new tasks IMALIGN and IMCENTROID written by Rob Seaman were added
    to the proto package. IMCENTROID computes a set of relative shifts
    required to register a set of images. IMALIGN both computes the
    shifts and aligns the images.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 29, 1990
    Even when use_display=no the task was trying to check the image display
    for the name.  This was fixed by adding a check for this flag in the
    relevant if statement.

noao$proto/imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 22, 1990
    The pset was being closed without indicating this in the data structure.
    The clcpset statement was removed.

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 15, 1990
    The EOF condition was being screwed up for two keystroke commands leading
    to a possible infinite loop when using a cursor file input.  The fix
    is to change the "nitems=nitems+clgcur" incrementing to simply
    "nitems=clgcur".

noao$proto/imedit/epbackground.x
noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 9, 1990
    1. The surfit pointer was incorrectly declared as real in ep_bg causing the
    'b' key to do nothing.  This appears to be SPARC dependent.
    2. Fixed some more problems with cursor strings having missing coordinates
    causing floating overflow errors.

noao$proto/iralign.par,ir/t_iralign.x
    Davis, Feb 27, 1990
    Changed the iralign parameter align to alignment for consistency with
    the other tasks.

noao$proto/imexamine/iecolon.x
    Valdes, Feb 16, 1990
    Fixed a mistake in the the datatype of a parg call.

noao$proto/ir/
    Davis, Feb 16, 1990
    Added a feature to the iralign code that permits the user to rerun
    the iralign, irmatch1d, and irmatch2d  using the first runs output
    as input. This permits the user to fine tune the intensity adjustments
    and shifts.

    Added compiled version of the join task and updated the documentation.
    Note that the parameters are now different.

noao$proto/imedit.par
noao$proto/imedit/epcolon.x
noao$proto/imedit/epmask.x
    Valdes, Jan 17, 1990
    1. Fixed typo in prompt string for y background order.
    2. Wrong datatype in clput for order parameters resulting in setting
       the user parameter file value to 0.
    3. Bug fix in epmask.  The following is the correct line:
       line 130:    call amovi (Memi[line], Memi[ptr2+i*EP_NX(ep)], EP_NX(ep))

noao$proto/imedit/epdisplay.x
    Valdes, Jan 7, 1990
    Added initialization to the zoom state.  Without the intialization
    starting IMEDIT without display and then turning display on followed by
    a 'r' would cause an error (very obscure but found in a demo).

    1. Tvmark has been modified to permit deletion as well as addition of
    objects to the coordinate file. Objects to be deleted are marked
    with the cursor and must be within a given tolerance of an
    object in the coordinate list to be deleted.
    2. The help screen no longer comes up in the text window when the task
    is invoked for the sake of uniformity with all other IRAF tasks.
    3. The coordinate file is opened read_only in batch mode. In interactive
    mode a warning message is issued if the user tries to append or delete
    objects from a file which does not have write permission and no action
    is taken.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
noao$proto/imexamine/iegimage.x
    Valdes, Nov 30, 1989
    The default display frame when not using an input list was changed from
    0 to 1.

noao$proto/ir/
    Davis, Nov 28, 1989
    New versions of the proto tasks IRMOSAIC, IRALIGN, IRMATCH1D and
    IRMATCH2D have been installed in the PROTO package. The routine
    have been modularised and now share code in preparation for a
    future database approach to the registration problem. The image i/o
    has been optimized so that all the tasks, but IRMOSAIC in particular,
    will run much faster. A bug in the alignment code in which errors of
    alignment of up to 0.5 pixels can occur has been fixed.
    There is now an option to trim each section before insertion into
    the output image. Finally the actions taken by the task can optionally
    be printed on the terminal.

noao$proto/imeidt/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Oct 30, 1989
    1. There was no check against INDEF cursor coordinates.  Such coordinates
    will occur when reading a previous logfile output and cursor input
    where the shorthand ":command" is used.  The actual error occured when
    attempting to add 0.5 to INDEF.

    Valdes, Aug 17, 1989
    1. Added errchk to main cursor loop to try and prevent loss of the
       user's changes if an error occurs.
    2. If no background points are found an error message is now printed
       instead of aborting.

noao$proto/tvmark/mkbmark.x
    Davis, Aug 4, 1989
    Modified tvmark so that drawing to the frame buffer is more efficient
    in batch mode. This involved removing a number of imflush calls
    which were unnecessarily flushing the output buffer to disk and
    recoding the basic routines which draw concentric circles and rectangles.

noao$proto/imreplace.par
    Valdes, July 20, 1989
    Changed mode of imaginary component value to hidden.

    New task IMEXAMINE added to the proto package.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June 6, 1989
    Fixed a bug in tvmark wherein circles were not being drawn if they
    were partially off the image in the x dimension.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June1, 1989
    A labeling capability has been added to tvmark. If the label parameter
    is turned on tvmark will label objects with the string in the third
    column of the coordinate file.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis,  May 25, 1989
    The problem reported by phil wherein TVMARK would go into an infinite
    loop if it encountered a blank line has been fixed.

    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task TVMARK was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/imedit/
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task IMEDIT was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/t_binfil.x
    Rooke, Apr 28, 1989
    After allocating temporary storage for header bytes in IRAFIL, the code
    was then reading those bytes instead into pixel storage, resulting in
    a segmentation violation if header > row of pixels (found by Jim
    Klavetter).

noao$proto/epix/epgdata.x
    Valdes, Mar 20, 1989
    Limit checking on the requested data region was wrong.  User would get
    out of bounds message if the line desired was greater than the number
    of columns.
 
noao$proto/t_bscale.x
    Davis, Feb 7, 1989
    Fixed a memory corruption error in bscale. If a user specified a section
    using the section parameter, the task was overflowing the data array
    by trying to read beyond the boundary of the section. 

    Fixed a floating divide by zero problem in the computation of
    step sizes when a specified section was only one pixel
    wide in a given dimension.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Jan 26, 1989
    A "pixel out of bounds" error was fixed in the task IRMATCH2D. This
    would occur if nxsub != nysub and for certain combination of corner
    and order. This bug has been fixed.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Nov 8, 1988
    The two prototype image intensity matching tasks IRMATCH1D and IRMATCH2D
    have been added to the proto package. See the help pages for further
    details.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Jul 23, 1988
    The number of columns and rows between adjacent subrasters in the output
    image produced by IRMOSAIC was incorrect if nxoverlap or nyoverlap were
    less than -1.

noao$proto/t_imslice.x
    Davis, Jul 8, 1988
    A new task imslice has been added to the proto package. IMSLICE reduces
    an n-dimensional image to a list of (n-1)-dimensional images.

    Added the absolute value function.  Combined the different functions
    into one procedure.

noao$proto/t_mkhistogram.x
    Davis, Feb 5, 1988
    A new task mkhistogram has been added to the proto package. Mkhistogram
    will task a stream of data and list or plot the histogram of the data.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Feb 3, 1988
    1. A new parameter "subtract" has been added to the IRMOSAIC task. If
    the "median" parameter is yes then IRMOSAIC will subtract the median
    from each subraster before adding it to the output image mosaic.

noao$proto
    Davis, Dec 8, 1987
    1. Two new tasks IRMOSAIC and IRALIGN have been added to the PROTO
    package. IRMOSAIC takes an ordered list of input images and places them
    on a grid in an output image. Options exist to order the input list
    by row, column or in a raster pattern starting at any of the four
    corners of the output image. Adjacent subrasters may be overlapped or
    separated by a specified number of columns and rows. Positions of objects
    which occur in adjacent subrasters can be marked using for example
    the sun imtool facility and centered using the APPHOT center routine.
    IRALIGN takes the mosaiced image and the coordinate list and produces an
    output image where all the individual subrasters have been aligned with
    respect to some reference subraster.  These two tasks are most useful for
    images which already lie approximately on a grid.

noao$proto/t_bscale.x +
noao$proto/bscale.par +
noao$proto/doc/bscale.hlp +
    Valdes, October 7, 1988
    A new task to compute to scale images by a zero point and scale factor
    has been added.  The zero point and scale factor can be chosen as the
    mean, median, or mode of the images.

noao$proto/doc/replicate.hlp -
    Valdes, June 4, 1987
    1.  Deleted this obsolete file.

noao$proto/toonedspec.x
noao$proto/doc/toonedspec.hlp
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The output spectra are now of type real regardless of the input
	pixel type.  This change was made to avoid fix point exceptions
	on AOS/VS IRAF when summing enough lines to overflow the input
	pixel type.  On the other IRAF systems integer overflows only cause
	erroneous output but no error.

noao$proto/fixline.gx
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The interpolation weights when interpolating across lines were
	being truncated and producing approximately correct values
	but not correct interpolation.  The weights are now not truncated.

noao$proto/join.cl
    Hammond, March 10, 1987
    1. Added script task JOIN, which joins two lists line by line.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
    Valdes, March 3, 1987
    1.  The input images being stacked were not being closed after they
	were added to the output image.

noao$proto/imrep.gx
    Valdes, February 5, 1987
    1.  There was a problem in AOS iraf because of an attempt to convert
	a real INDEF to a short value.  The routine was modified to attempt
	the conversion only if the value is not INDEF.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
noao$proto/doc/imstack.hlp
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
    1.  Modified IMSTACK to use image templates instead of file templates.
	All image tasks should use the image template package for consistency.
    2.  Modified the help page.  One of the examples was incorrect.

noao$proto/imfunction.x
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
    1.  Doug Tody added the square root function.  I don't know the
	details of the revision.

noao$proto/imlog.gx
noao$proto/imdex.gx +
noao$proto/funcs.x -
noao$proto/doc/imfunction.hlp
    Valdes, September 9, 1986
    1.  Added the "dex" function which is the inverse of the existing "log"
	function.
    2.  The help page was revised.

proto$toonedspec:  Valdes, June 16, 1986
    1.  Added new task TOONEDSPEC to convert columns or lines of 2D
	spectra to 1D spectra.  A manual page was also added.  This
	is a prototype.  The task or it's function will eventually
	move to the TWODSPEC package.

======================
Package reorganization
======================

local$dsttoiraf:  Valdes, April 7, 1986
    1.  The task resides now on NOAO/VMS SKD:[LOCAL.DAOP]

local$t_imstack.x:  Valdes, April 6, 1986
local$doc/imstack.hlp:  Valdes, April 6, 1986
    1.  Removed warning message about mixed datatypes in IMSTACK.
    2.  Updated help page for IMSTACK.

local$dsttoiraf:  Valdes, April 3, 1986
    1.  Added NOAO foreign task to convert DST (DAO) format images to
	IRAF images.  This task is only available on the NOAO/VMS cluster.
	Attempting to run this on any other system will fail.

local$irafil:  Valdes, April 3, 1986
    1.  George Jacoby added the task IRAFIL to convert integer byte
	pixel data to an IRAF image.  It is an attempt to have a general
	dataio conversion for foreign format images.
