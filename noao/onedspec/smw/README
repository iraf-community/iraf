This directory contains interface routines for the spectral world
coordinate systems.  The interface has two functions.  The first is to
convert various input formats, including old formats, to one of the WCS
formats used by the ONEDSPEC package.  These are MULTISPEC, EQUISPEC, and
NDSPEC.  The second is to split large numbers of spectra which exceed the
limits of the MWCS for a single WCS into a number of smaller WCS.
