USAGE
aidpars

PARAMETERS
.ls reflist = ""
Optional reference coordinate list to use in the pattern matching algorithm
in place of the task coordinate list.  This file is a simple text list of
dispersion coordinates.  It would normally be a culled and limited list of
lines for the specific data being identified.
.le
.ls refspec = ""
Optional reference dispersion calibrated spectrum.  This template spectrum
is used to select the prominent lines for the pattern matching algorithm.
It need not have the same dispersion increment or dispersion coverage as
the target spectrum.
.le
.ls crpix = "INDEF"
Coordinate reference pixel for the coordinate reference value specified by
the \fIcrval\fR parameter.  This may be specified as a pixel coordinate
or an image header keyword name (with or without a '!' prefix).  In the
latter case the value of the keyword in the image header of the spectrum
being identified is used.  A value of INDEF translates to the middle of
the target spectrum.
.le
.ls crquad = INDEF
Quadratic correction to the detected pixel positions to "linearize" the
pattern of line spacings.  The corrected positions x' are derived from
the measured positions x by

.nf
    x' = x + crquad * (x - crpix)**2
.fi

where crpix is the pixel reference point as defined by the \fIcrpix\fR
parameter.  The measured and corrected positions may be examined by
using the 't' debug flag.  The value may be a number or a header
keyword (with or without a '!' prefix).  The default of INDEF translates
to zero; i.e. no quadratic correction.
.le
.ls cddir = "sign" (unknown|sign|increasing|decreasing)
The sense of the dispersion increment with respect to the pixel coordinates
in the input spectrum.  The possible values are "increasing" or
"decreasing" if the dispersion coordinates increase or decrease with
increasing pixel coordinates, "sign" to use the sign of the dispersion
increment (positive is increasing and negative is decreasing), and
"unknown" if the sense is unknown and to be determined by the algorithm.
.le
.ls crsearch = "INDEF"
Coordinate reference value search radius.  The value may be specified
as a numerical value or as an image header keyword (with or without
a '!' prefix) whose value is to be used.  The algorithm will search
for a final coordinate reference value within this amount of the value
specified by \fIcrval\fR.  If the value is positive the search radius is
the specified value.  If the value is negative it is the absolute value
of this parameter times \fIcdelt\fR times the number of pixels in the
input spectrum; i.e. it is the fraction of dispersion range covered by the
target spectrum assuming a dispersion increment per pixel of \fIcdelt\fR.
A value of INDEF translates to -0.1 which corresponds to a search radius
of 10% of the estimated dispersion range.
.le
.ls cdsearch = "INDEF"
Dispersion coordinate increment search radius.  The value may be specified
as a numerical value or as an image header keyword (with or without
a '!' prefix) whose value is to be used.  The algorithm will search
for a dispersion coordinate increment within this amount of the value
specified by \fIcdelt\fR.  If the value is positive the search radius is
the specified value.  If the value is negative it is the absolute value of
this parameter times \fIcdelt\fR; i.e.  it is a fraction of \fIcdelt\fR.
A value of INDEF translates to -0.1 which corresponds to a search radius
of 10% of \fIcdelt\fR.
.le
.ls ntarget = 100
Number of spectral lines from the target spectrum to use in the pattern
matching.
.le
.ls npattern = 5
Initial number of spectral lines in patterns to be matched.  There is a
minimum of 3 and a maximum of 10.  The algorithm starts with the specified
number and if no solution is found with that number it is iteratively
decreased by one to the minimum of 3.  A larger number yields fewer
and more likely candidate matches and so will produce a result sooner.
But in order to be thorough the algorithm will try smaller patterns to
search more possiblities.
.le
.ls nneighbors = 10
Number of neighbors to use in making patterns of lines.  This parameter
restricts patterns to include lines which are near each other.
.le
.ls nbins = 6
Maximum number of bins to divide the reference coordinate list or spectrum
in searching for a solution.  When there are no weak dispersion constraints
the algorithm subdivides the full range of the coordinate list or reference
spectrum into one bin, two bins, etc. up to this maximum.  Each bin is
searched for a solution.
.le
.ls ndmax = 1000
Maximum number of candidate dispersions to examine.  The algorithm ranks
candidate dispersions by how many candidate spectral lines are fit and the
the weights assigned by the pattern matching algorithm.  Starting from
the highest rank it tests each candidate dispersion to see if it is
a satisfactory solution.  This parameter determines how many candidate
dispersion in the ranked list are examined.
.le
.ls aidord = 3 (minimum of 2)
The order of the dispersion function fit by the automatic identification
algorithm.  This is the number of polynomial coefficients so
a value of two is a linear function and a value of three is a quadratic
function.  The order should be restricted to values of two or three.
Higher orders can lead to incorrect solutions because of the increased
degrees of freedom if finding incorrect line identifications.
.le
.ls maxnl = 0.02
Maximum non-linearity allowed in any trial dispersion function.
The definition of the non-linearity test is

.nf
    maxnl > (w(0.5) - w(0)) / (w(1) - w(0)) - 0.5
.fi

where w(x) is the dispersion function value (e.g. wavelength) of the fit
and x is a normalized pixel positions where the endpoints of the spectrum
are [0,1].  If the test fails on a trial dispersion fit then a linear
function is determined.
.le
.ls nfound = 6
Minimum number of identified spectral lines required in the final solution.
If a candidate solution has fewer identified lines it is rejected.
.le
.ls sigma = 0.05
Sigma (uncertainty) in the line center estimates specified in pixels.
This is used to propagate uncertainties in the line spacings in
the observed patterns of lines.
.le
.ls minratio = 0.1
Minimum spacing ratio used.  Patterns of lines in which the ratio of
spacings between consecutive lines is less than this amount are excluded.
.le
.ls rms = 0.1
RMS goal for a correct dispersion solution.  This is the RMS in the
measured spectral lines relative to the expected positions from the
coordinate line list based on the coordinate dispersion solution.
The parameter is specified in terms of the line centering parameter
\fIfwidth\fR since for broader lines the pixel RMS would be expected
to be larger.  A pixel-based RMS criterion is used to be independent of
the dispersion.  The RMS will be small for a valid solution.
.le
.ls fmatch = 0.2
Goal for the fraction of unidentified lines in a correct dispersion
solution.  This is the fraction of the strong lines seen in the spectrum
which are not identified and also the fraction of all lines in the
coordinate line list, within the range of the dispersion solution, not
identified.  Both fractions will be small for a valid solution.
.le
.ls debug = ""
Print or display debugging information.  This is intended for the developer
and not the user.  The parameter is specified as a string of characters
where each character displays some information.  The characters are:

.nf
    a: Print candidate line assignments.
    b: Print search limits.
    c: Print list of line ratios.
*   d: Graph dispersions.
*   f: Print final result.
*   l: Graph lines and spectra.
    r: Print list of reference lines.
*   s: Print search iterations.
    t: Print list of target lines.
    v: Print vote array.

DESCRIPTION
The \fBaidpars\fR parameter set contains the parameters for the automatic
spectral line identification algorithm used in the task \fBautoidentify\fR,
\fBidentify\fR, and \fBreidentify\fR.  These tasks include the parameter
\fIaidpars\fR which links to this parameters set.  Typing \fBaidpars\fR
allows these parameters to be edited.  When editing the parameters of the
other tasks with \fBeparam\fR one can edit the \fBaidpars\fR parameters by
type ":e" when pointing to the \fIaidpars\fR task parameter.  The values of
the \fBaidpars\fR parameters may also be set on the command line for the
task.  The discussion which follows describes the parameters and the
algorithm.

The goal of the automatic spectral line identification algorithm is to
automate the identification of spectral lines so that given an observed
spectrum of a spectral line source (called the target spectrum) and a file
of known dispersion coordinates for the lines, the software will identify
the spectral lines and use these identifications to determine a
dispersion function.  This algorithm is quite general so that the correct
identifications and dispersion function may be found even when there is
limited or no knowledge of the dispersion coverage and resolution of the
observation.

However, when a general line list, including a large dispersion range and
many weak lines, is used and the observation covers a much smaller portion
of the coordinate list the algorithm may take a long to time or even fail
to find a solution.  Thus, it is highly desirable to provide additional
input giving approximate dispersion parameters and their uncertainties.
When available, a dispersion calibrated reference spectrum (not necessarily
of the same resolution or wavelength coverage) also aids the algorithm by
indicating the relative strengths of the lines in the coordinate file.  The
line strengths need not be very similar (due to different lamps or
detectors) but will still help separate the inherently weak and strong
lines.

The Input

The primary inputs to the algorithm are the observed one dimensional target
spectrum in which the spectral lines are to be identified and a dispersion
function determined and a file of reference dispersion coordinates.  These
inputs are provided in the tasks using the automatic line identification
algorithm.

One way to limit the algorithm to a specific dispersion region and to the
important spectral lines is to use a limited coordinate list.  One may do
this with the task coordinate list parameter (\fIcoordlist\fR).  However,
it is desirable to use a standard master line list that includes all the
lines, both strong and weak.  Therefore, one may specify a limited line
list with the parameter \fIreflist\fR.  The coordinates in this list will
be used by the automatic identification algorithm to search for patterns
while using the primary coordinate list for adding weaker lines during the
dispersion function fitting.

The tasks \fBautoidentify\fR and \fBidentify\fR also provide parameters to
limit the search range.  These parameters specify a reference dispersion
coordinate (\fIcrval\fR) and a dispersion increment per pixel (\fIcdelt\fR).
When these parameters are INDEF this tells the algorithm to search for a
solution over the entire range of possibilities covering the coordinate
line list or reference spectrum.

The reference dispersion coordinate refers to an approximate coordinate at
the reference pixel coordinate specified by the parameter \fIcrpix\fR.
The default value for the reference pixel coordinate is INDEF which
translates to the central pixel of the target spectrum.

The parameters \fIcrsearch\fR and \fIcdsearch\fR specify the expected range
or uncertainty of the reference dispersion coordinate and dispersion
increment per pixel respectively.  They may be specified as an absolute
value or as a fraction.  When the values are positive they are used
as an absolute value;

.nf
    crval(final) = \fIcrval\fR +/- \fIcrsearch\fR
    cdelt(final) = \fIcdelt\fR +/- \fIcdsearch\fR.
.fi

When the values are negative they are used as a fraction of the dispersion
range or fraction of the dispersion increment;

.nf
    crval(final) = \fIcrval\fR +/- abs (\fIcrsearch\fR * \fIcdelt\fR) * N_pix
    cdelt(final) = \fIcdelt\fR +/- abs (\fIcdsearch\fR * \fIcdelt\fR)
.fi

where abs is the absolute value function and N_pix is the number of pixels
in the target spectrum.  When the ranges are not given explicitly, that is
they are specified as INDEF, default values of -0.1 are used.

The parameters \fIcrval\fR, \fIcdelt\fR, \fIcrpix\fR, \fIcrsearch\fR,
and \fIcdsearch\fR may be given explicit numerical values or may
be image header keyword names.  In the latter case the values of the
indicated keywords are used.  This feature allows the approximate
dispersion range information to be provided by the data acquisition
system; either by the instrumentation or by user input.

Because sometimes only the approximate magnitude of the dispersion
increment is known and not the sign (i.e. whether the dispersion
coordinates increase or decrease with increasing pixel coordinates)
the parameter \fIcdsign\fR specifies if the dispersion direction is
"increasing", "decreasing", "unknown", or defined by the "sign" of the
approximate dispersion increment parameter (sign of \fIcdelt\fR).

The above parameters defining the approximate dispersion of the target
spectrum apply to \fIautoidentify\fR and \fIidentify\fR.  The task
\fBreidentify\fR does not use these parameters except that the \fIshift\fR
parameter corresponds to \fIcrsearch\fR if it is non-zero.  This task
assumes that spectra to be reidentified are the same as a reference
spectrum except for a zero point dispersion offset; i.e. the approximate
dispersion parameters are the same as the reference spectrum.  The
dispersion increment search range is set to be 5% and the sign of the
dispersion increment is the same as the reference spectrum.

An optional input is a dispersion calibrated reference spectrum (referred to
as the reference spectrum in the discussion).  This is specified either in
the coordinate line list file or by the parameter \fIrefspec\fR.  To
specify a spectrum in the line list file the comment "# Spectrum <image>"
is included where <image> is the image filename of the reference spectrum.
Some of the standard line lists in linelists$ may include a reference
spectrum.  The reference spectrum is used to select the strongest lines for
the pattern matching algorithm.

The Algorithm

First a list of the pixel positions for the strong spectral lines in the
target spectrum is created.  This is accomplished by finding the local
maxima, sorting them by pixel value, and then using a centering algorithm
(\fIcenter1d\fR) to accurately find the centers of the line profiles.  Note
that task parameters \fIftype\fR, \fIfwidth\fR, \fIcradius\fR,
\fIthreshold\fR, and \fIminsep\fR are used for the centering.  The number
of spectral lines selected is set by the parameter \fIntarget\fR.

In order to insure that lines are selected across the entire spectrum
when all the strong lines are concentrated in only a part of the
spectrum, the spectrum is divided into five regions and approximately
a fifth of the requested number of lines is found in each region.

A list of reference dispersion coordinates is selected from the coordinate
file (\fIcoordlist\fR or \fIreflist\fR).  The number of reference
dispersion coordinates is set at twice the number of target lines found.
The reference coordinates are either selected uniformly from the coordinate
file or by locating the strong spectral lines (in the same way as for the
target spectrum) in a reference spectrum if one is provided.  The selection
is limited to the expected range of the dispersion as specified by the
user.  If no approximate dispersion information is provided the range of
the coordinate file or reference spectrum is used.

The ratios of consecutive spacings (the lists are sorted in increasing
order) for N-tuples of coordinates are computed from both lists.  The size
of the N-tuple pattern is set by the \fInpattern\fR parameter.  Rather than
considering all possible combinations of lines only patterns of lines with
all members within \fInneighbors\fR in the lists are used; i.e. the first
and last members of a pattern must be within \fInneighbors\fR of each other
in the lists.  The default case is to find all sets of five lines which are
within ten lines of each other and compute the three spacing ratios.
Because very small spacing ratios become uncertain, the line patterns are
limited to those with ratios greater than the minimum specified by the
\fIminratio\fR parameter.  Note that if the direction of the dispersion is
unknown then one computes the ratios in the reference coordinates in both
directions.

The basic idea is that similar patterns in the pixel list and the
dispersion list will have matching spacing ratios to within a tolerance
derived by the uncertainties in the line positions (\fIsigma\fR) from the
target spectrum.  The reference dispersion coordinates are assumed to have
no uncertainty.  All matches in the ratio space are found between patterns
in the two lists.  When matches are made then the candidate identifications
(pixel, reference dispersion coordinate) between the elements of the
patterns are recorded.  After finding all the matches in ratio space a
count is made of how often each possible candidate identification is
found.  When there are a sufficient number of true pairs between the lists
(of order 25% of the shorter list) then true identifications will appear in
common in many different patterns.  Thus the highest counts of candidate
identifications are the most likely to be true identifications.

Because the relationship between the pixel positions of the lines in the
target spectrum and the line positions in the reference coordinate space
is generally non-linear the line spacing ratios are distorted and may
reduce the pattern matching.  The line patterns are normally restricted
to be somewhat near each other by the \fInneighbors\fR so some degree of
distortion can be tolerated.  But in order to provide the ability to remove
some of this distortion when it is known the parameter \fIcrquad\fR is
provided.  This parameter applies a quadratic transformation to the measured
pixel positions to another set of "linearized" positions  which are used
in the line ratio pattern matching.  The form of the transformation is

.nf
    x' = x + crquad * (x - crpix)**2
.fi

where x is the measured position, x' is the transformed position,
crquad is the value of the distortion parameter, and crpix is the value
of the coordinate reference position.

If approximate dispersion parameters and search ranges are defined then
candidate identifications which fall outside the range of dispersion
function possibilities are rejected.  From the remaining candidate
identifications the highest vote getters are selected.  The number selected
is three times the number of target lines.

All linear dispersions functions, where dispersion and pixel coordinates
are related by a zero point and slope, are found that pass within two
pixels of two or more of the candidate identifications.  The dispersion
functions are ranked primarily by the number of candidate identifications
fitting the dispersion and secondarily by the total votes in the
identifications.  Only the highest ranking candidate linear dispersion
are kept.  The number of candidate dispersions kept is set by the
parameter \fIndmax\fR.

The candidate dispersions are evaluated in order of their ranking.  Each
line in the coordinate file (\fIcoordlist\fR) is converted to a pixel
coordinate based on the dispersion function.  The centering algorithm
attempts to find a line profile near that position as defined by the
\fImatch\fR parameter.  This may be specified in pixel or dispersion
coordinates.  All the lines found are used to fit a polynomial dispersion
function with \fIaidord\fR coefficients.  The order should be linear or
quadratic because otherwise the increased degrees of freedom allow
unrealistic dispersion functions to appear to give a good result.  A
quadratic function (\fIaidord\fR = 3) is allowed since this is the
approximate form of many dispersion functions.

However, to avoid unrealistic dispersion functions a test is made that
the maximum amplitude deviation from a linear function is less than
an amount specified by the \fImaxnl\fR parameter.  The definition of
the test is

.nf
    maxnl > (w(0.5) - w(0)) / (w(1) - w(0)) - 0.5
.fi

where w(x) is the dispersion function value (e.g. wavelength) of the fit
and x is a normalized pixel positions where the endpoints of the spectrum
are [0,1].  What this relation means is that the wavelength interval
between one end and the center relative to the entire wavelength interval
is within maxnl of one-half.  If the test fails then a linear function
is fit.  The process of adding lines based on the last dispersion function
and then refitting the dispersion function is iterated twice.  At the end
of this step if fewer than the number of lines specified by the parameter
\fInfound\fR have been identified the candidate dispersion is eliminated.

The quality of the line identifications and dispersion solution is
evaluated based on three criteria.  The first one is the root-mean-square
of the residuals between the pixel coordinates derived from lines found
from the dispersion coordinate file based on the dispersion function and
the observed pixel coordinates.  This pixel RMS is normalized by the target
RMS set with the \fIrms\fR parameter.  Note that the \fIrms\fR parameter
is specified in units of the \fIfwidth\fR parameter.  This is because if
the lines are broader, requiring a larger fwidth to obtain a centroid,
then the expected uncertainty would be larger.  A good solution will have
a normalized rms value less than one.  A pixel RMS criterion, as opposed
to a dispersion coordinate RMS, is used since this is independent of the
actual dispersion of the spectrum.

The other two criteria are the fraction of strong lines from the target
spectrum list which were not identified with lines in the coordinate file
and the fraction of all the lines in the coordinate file (within the
dispersion range covered by the candidate dispersion) which were not
identified.  These are normalized to a target value given by \fIfmatch\fR.
The default matching goal is 0.3 which means that less than 30% of
the lines should be unidentified or greater than 70% should be identified.
As with the RMS, a value of one or less corresponds to a good solution.

The reason the fraction identified criteria are used is that the pixel RMS
can be minimized by finding solutions with large dispersion increment per
pixel.  This puts all the lines in the coordinate file into a small range
of pixels and so (incorrect) lines with very small residuals can be found.
The strong line identification criterion is clearly a requirement that
humans use in evaluating a solution.  The fraction of all lines identified,
as opposed to the number of lines identified, in the coordinate file is
included to reduce the case of a large dispersion increment per pixel
mapping a large number of lines (such as the entire list) into the range of
pixels in the target spectrum.  This can give the appearance of finding a
large number of lines from the coordinate file.  However, an incorrect
dispersion will also find a large number which are not matched.  Hence the
fraction not matched will be high.

The three criteria, all of which are normalized so that values less
than one are good, are combined to a single figure of merit by a weighted
average.  Equal weights have been found to work well; i.e. each criterion
is one-third of the figure of merit.  In testing it has been found that all
correct solutions over a wide range of resolutions and dispersion coverage
have figures of merit less than one and typically of order 0.2.  All
incorrect candidate dispersion have values of order two to three.

The search for the correct dispersion function terminates immediately,
but after checking the first five most likely candidates, when
a figure of merit less than one is found.  The order in which the candidate
dispersions are tested, that is by rank, was chosen to try the most promising
first so that often the correct solution is found on the first attempt.

When the approximate dispersion is not known or is imprecise it is
often the case that the pixel and coordinate lists will not overlap
enough to have a sufficient number true coordinate pairs.  Thus, at a
higher level the above steps are iterated by partitioning the dispersion
space searched into bins of various sizes.  The largest size is the
maximum dispersion range including allowance for the search radii.
The smallest size bin is obtained by dividing the dispersion range by
the number specified by the \fInbins\fR parameter.  The actual number
of bins searched at each bin size is actually twice the number of
bins minus one because the bins are overlapped by 50%.

The search is done starting with bins in the middle of the size range and
in the middle of the dispersion range and working outward towards larger
and smaller bins and larger and smaller dispersion ranges.  This is done to
improved the chances of finding the correction dispersion function in the
smallest number of steps.

Another iteration performed if no solution is found after trying all the
candidate dispersion and bins is to reduce the number of lines in the
pattern.  So the parameter \fInpattern\fR is an initial maximum pattern.
A larger pattern gives fewer and higher quality candidate identifications
and so converges faster.  However, if no solution is found the algorithm
tries more possible matches produced by a lower number of lines in
the pattern.  The pattern groups are reduced to a minimum of three lines.

When a set of line identifications and dispersion solution satisfying the
figure of merit criterion is found a final step is performed.
Up to this point only linear dispersion functions are used since higher order
function can be stretch in unrealistic ways to give good RMS values
and fit all the lines.  The final step is to use the line identifications
to fit a dispersion function using all the parameters specified by the
user (such as function type, order, and rejection parameters).  This
is iterated to add new lines from the coordinate list based on the
more general dispersion function and then obtain a final dispersion
function.  The line identifications and dispersion function are then
returned to the task using this automatic line identification algorithm.

If a satisfactory  solution is not found after searching all the
possibilities the algorithm will inform the task using it and the task will
report this appropriately.

There were many changes made in the paramters and algorithm.  New parameters
are "crquad" and "maxnl".  Changed definitions are for "rms".  Default
value changes are for "cddir", "ntarget", "ndmax", and "fmatch".  The most
significant changes in the algorithm are to allow for more non-linear
