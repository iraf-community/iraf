NAME
autoidentify -- Automatically identify lines and fit dispersion
.ih
SUMMARY
Spectral lines are automatically identified from a list of coordinates
by pattern matching.  The identified lines are then used to fit a
dispersion function which is written to a database for later use
in dispersion calibration.  After a solution is found the identified
lines and dispersion function may be examined interactively.

PARAMETERS
.ls images
List of images containing one dimensional spectra in which to identify
spectral lines and fit dispersion functions.  For two and three dimensional
spectral and spatial data one may use an image section to select a one
dimensional spectral vector or use the \fIsection\fR parameter.
.le
.ls crval, cdelt
These parameters specify an approximate coordinate value and coordinate
interval per pixel.  They may be specified as numerical values, INDEF, or
image header keyword names whose values are to be used.  The coordinate
reference value is for the pixel specified by the parameter
\fIaidpars.crpix\fR.  The default reference pixel is INDEF which means the
middle of the spectrum.  By default only the magnitude of the coordinate
interval is used and the search will include both increasing and decreasing
coordinate values with increasing pixel values.  If one or both of these
parameters are specified as INDEF the search for a solution will be slower
and more likely to fail.
.le
.ls coordlist = ""
Coordinate list consisting of an list of spectral line coordinates.
A comment line of the form "# units <units>", where <units> is one of the
understood units names, defines the units of the coordinate list.  If no units
are specified then Angstroms are assumed.
The line list is used for both the final identifications and for the set of
lines to use in the automatic search.  A restricted search list may be
specified with the parameter \fIaidpars.reflist\fR.  The line list may
contain a comment line of the form "# Spectrum <name>", where <name> is a
filename containing a reference spectrum.  The reference spectrum will be
used in selecting the strong lines for the automatic search.  A reference
spectrum may also be specified with the parameter \fIaidpars.refspec\fR.

Some standard line lists are available in the directory "linelists$".
See the help topic \fIlinelists\fR for the available line lists.
.le
.ls units = ""
The units to use if no database entry exists.  The units are specified as
described in

.nf
    cl> help onedspec.package section=units
.fi

If no units are specified and a coordinate list is used then the units of
the coordinate list are selected.  If a database entry exists then the
units defined there override both this parameter and the coordinate list.
.le
.ls interactive = yes (no|yes|NO|YES)
After automatically identifying the spectral lines and dispersion function
review and modify the solution interactively?  If "yes" a query is given
for each spectrum providing the choice of interactive review.  The
query may be turned off during execution.  If "YES" the interactive review
is entered automatically without a query.  The interactive, graphical
review is the same as the task \fBidentify\fR with a few restriction.
.le
.ls aidpars = "" (parameter set)
Parameter set for the automatic line identification algorithm.  The
parameters are described in the help topic \fBaidpars\fR.
.le

For two and three dimensional spectral images the following parameters are
used to select a one dimensional spectrum.
.ls section = "middle line"
If an image is not one dimensional or specified as a one dimensional image
section then the image section given by this parameter is used.  The
section defines a one dimensional spectrum.  The dispersion direction is
derived from the vector direction.

The section parameter may be specified directly as an image section or
in one of the following forms

.nf
line|column|x|y|z first|middle|last|# [first|middle|last|#]]
first|middle|last|# [first|middle|last|#] line|column|x|y|z
.fi

where each field can be one of the strings separated by | except for #
which is an integer number.  The field in [] is a second designator which
is used with three dimensional data.  Abbreviations are allowed though
beware that 'l' is not a sufficient abbreviation.
.le
.ls nsum = "1"
Number of lines, columns, or bands across the designated dispersion axis to
be summed when the image is a two or three dimensional image.
It does not apply to multispec format spectra.  If the image is three
dimensional an optional second number can be specified for the higher
dimensional axis  (the first number applies to the lower axis number and
the second to the higher axis number).  If a second number is not specified
the first number is used for both axes.
.le

The following parameters are used in finding spectral lines.
.ls ftype = "emission"
Type of spectral lines to be identified.  The possibly abbreviated choices are
"emission" and "absorption".
.le
.ls fwidth = 4.
Full-width at the base (in pixels) of the spectral lines to be identified.
.le
.ls cradius = 5.
The maximum distance, in pixels, allowed between a line position
and the initial estimate when defining a new line.
.le
.ls threshold = 0.
In order for a line center to be determined the range of pixel intensities
around the line must exceed this threshold.
.le
.ls minsep = 2.
The minimum separation, in pixels, allowed between line positions
when defining a new line.
.le
.ls match = -3.
The maximum difference for a match between the line coordinate derived from
the dispersion function and a coordinate in the coordinate list.  Positive
values are in user coordinate units and negative values are in units of
pixels.
.le

The following parameters are used to fit a dispersion function to the user
coordinates.  The \fBicfit\fR routines are used and further descriptions
about these parameters may be found under that topic.
.ls function = "spline3"
The function to be fit to user coordinates as a function of the pixel
coordinates.  The choices are "chebyshev", "legendre", "spline1", or "spline3".
.le
.ls order = 1
Order of the fitting function.  The order is the number of polynomial
terms (coefficients) or the number of spline pieces.
.le
.ls sample = "*"
Sample regions for fitting specified in pixel coordinates.
.le
.ls niterate = 10
Number of rejection iterations.
.le
.ls low_reject = 3.0, high_reject = 3.0
Lower and upper residual rejection in terms of the RMS of the fit.
.le
.ls grow = 0
Distance from a rejected point in which additional points are automatically
rejected regardless of their residuals.
.le

The following parameters control the input and output.
.ls dbwrite = "yes"  (no|yes|NO|YES)
Automatically write or update the database with the line identifications
and dispersion function?  If "no" or "NO" then there is no database
output.  If "YES" the results are automatically written to the database.
If "yes" a query is made allowing the user to reply with "no", "yes", "NO"
or "YES".  The negative responses do not write to the database and the
affirmative ones do write to the database.  The upper-case responses
suppress any further queries for any remaining spectra.
.le
.ls overwrite = yes
Overwrite previous solutions in the database?  If there is a previous
solution for the spectrum being identified this parameter selects whether
to skip the spectrum ("no") or find a new solution ("yes").  In the later
case saving the solution to the database will overwrite the previous
solution.
.le
.ls database = "database"
Database for reading and writing the line identifications and
dispersion functions.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print results of the identification on the standard output?
.le
.ls logfile = "logfile"
Filename for recording log information about the identifications.
The null string, "", may be specified to skip recording the log information.
.le
.ls plotfile = ""
Filename for recording log plot information as IRAF metacode.  A
null string, "", may be specified to skip recording the plot information.

DESCRIPTION
\fBAutoidentify\fR automatically identifies spectral lines from a list of
spectral line coordinates (\fIcoordlist\fR) and determines a dispersion
function.  The identified lines and the dispersion function may be reviewed
interactively (\fIinteractive\fR) and the final results are recorded in a
\fIdatabase\fR.

Each image in the input list (\fIimages\fR) is considered in turn.  If the
image is not one dimensional or a one dimensional section of an image then
the parameter \fIsection\fR is used to select a one dimensional
spectrum.  It defines the dispersion direction and central spatial
coordinate(s).  If the image is not one dimensional or a set of one
dimensional spectra n multispec format then the \fInsum\fR parameter
selects the number of neighboring lines, columns, and bands to sum.

This task is not intended to be used on all spectra in an image since in
most cases the dispersion functions will be similar though possibly with a
zero point shift.  Once one spectrum is identified the others may be
reidentified with \fBreidentify\fR.

The coordinate list of spectral lines often covers a much larger dispersion
range than the spectra being identified.  This is true of the standard line
lists available in the "linelists$" directory.  While the algorithm for
identifying the lines will often succeed with a large line list it is not
guaranteed nor will it find the solution quickly without additional
information.  Thus it is highly desirable to provide the algorithm with
approximate information about the spectra.  Generally this information is
known by the observer or recorded in the image header.

As implied in the previous paragraph, one may use a
limited coordinate line list that matches the dispersion coverage of the
spectra reasonably well (say within 100% of the dispersion range).
This may be done with the \fIcoordlist\fR parameter or a second
coordinate list used only for the automatic search may be specified
with the parameter \fIaidpars.reflist\fR.  This allows using a smaller
culled list of lines for finding the matching patterns and a large list
with weaker lines for the final dispersion function fit.

The alternative to a limited list is to use the parameters \fIcrval\fR and
\fIcdelt\fR to specify the approximate coordinate range and dispersion
interval per pixel.  These parameters may be given explicitly or by
specifying image header keywords.  The pixel to which \fIcrval\fR refers is
specified by the parameter \fIaidpars.crpix\fR.  By default this is INDEF
which means use the center of the spectrum.  The direction in which the
dispersion coordinates increase relative to the pixel coordinates may be
specified by the \fIaidpars.cddir\fR parameter.  The default is "unknown"
to search in either direction.

The algorithm used to automatically identify the spectral lines and
find a dispersion function is described under the help topic
\fBaidpars\fR.  This topic also describes the various algorithm
parameters.  The default parameters are adequate for most data.

The characteristics of the spectral lines to be found and identified are
set by several parameters.  The type of spectral lines, whether "emission"
or "absorption", is set by the parameter \fIftype\fR.  For arc-line
calibration spectra this parameter is set to "emission".  The full-width
(in pixels) at the base of the spectral lines is set by the parameter
\fIfwidth\fR.  This is used by the centering algorithm to define the extent
of the line profile to be centered.  The \fIthreshold\fR parameter defines
a minimum contrast (difference) between a line peak and the neighboring
continuum.  This allows noise peaks to be ignored.  Finding the center of a
possible line begins with an initial position estimate.  This may be an
interactive cursor position or the expected position from the coordinate
line list.  The centering algorithm then searches for a line of the
specified type, width, and threshold within a given distance, specified by
the \fIcradius\fR parameter.  These parameters and the centering algorithm
are described by the help topic \fBcenter1d\fR.

To avoid finding the same line multiple times, say when there are two lines
in the line list which are blended into a single in the observation, the
\fIminsep\fR parameter rejects any new line position found within that
distance of a previously defined line.

The automatic identification of lines includes matching a line position in
the spectrum against the list of coordinates in the coordinate line list.
The \fImatch\fR parameter defines how close the measured line position must
be to a coordinate in the line list to be considered a possible
identification.  This parameter may be specified either in user coordinate
units (those used in the line list) by using a positive value or in pixels
by using a negative value.  In the former case the line position is
converted to user coordinates based on a dispersion function and in the
latter the line list coordinate is converted to pixels using the inverse of
the dispersion function.

The dispersion function is determined by fitting a set of pixel positions
and user coordinate identifications by least squares to a specified
function type.  The fitting requires a function type, \fIfunction\fR, and
the order (number of coefficients or spline pieces), \fIorder\fR.
In addition the fitting can be limited to specified regions, \fIsample\fR,
and provide for the rejection of points with large residuals.  These
parameters are set in advance and used during the automatic dispersion
function determination.  Later the fitting may be modified interactively.
For additional discussion of these parameters see \fBicfit\fR.

The output of this program consists of log information, plot information,
and the line identifications and dispersion function.  The log information
may be appended to the file specified by the \fIlogfile\fR parameter
and printed to the standard output (normally the terminal) by
setting the \fIverbose\fR parameter to yes.  This information consists
of a banner line, a line of column labels, and results for each spectrum.
For each spectrum the spectrum name, the number of spectral lines found,
the dispersion coordinate at the middle of the spectrum, the dispersion
increment per pixel, and the root-mean-square (RMS) of the residuals for
the lines used in the dispersion function fit is recorded.  The units of
the RMS are those of the user (line list) coordinates.  If a solution is
not found the spectrum name and a message is printed.

The line identifications and dispersion function are written to the
specified \fIdatabase\fR.  The current format of the database is described
in the help for \fIidentify\fR.  If a database entry is already present for
a spectrum and the parameter \fIoverwrite\fR is "no" then the spectrum is
skipped and a message is printed to the standard output.   After a solution
is found and after any interactive review (see below) the results may be
written to the database.  The \fIdbwrite\fR parameter may be specified as
"no" or "NO" to disable writing to the database (and no queries will be
made), as "yes" to query whether to or not to write to the database, or as
"YES" to automatically write the results to the database with no queries.
When a query is given the responses may be "no" or "yes" for an individual
spectrum or "NO" or "YES" for all remaining spectra without further
queries.

After a solution is found one may review and modify the line
identifications and dispersion function using the graphical functions of
the \fBidentify\fR task (with the exception that a new spectrum may not be
selected).  The review mode is selected with the \fIinteractive\fR
parameter.  If the parameter is "no" or "NO" then no interactive review
will be provided and there will be no queries either.  If the parameter is
"YES" then the graphical review mode will be entered after each solution is
found without any query.  If the parameter is "yes" then a query will be
made after a solution is found and after any log information is written to
the terminal.  One may respond to the query with "no" or "yes" for an
individual spectrum or "NO" or "YES" for all remaining spectra without
further queries.  For "yes" or "YES" the \fIidentify\fR review  mode is
entered.  To exit type 'q'.
