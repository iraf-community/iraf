NAME
slist -- List spectral header information
.ih
USAGE
slist images
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
List of images to be listed.
.le
.ls apertures = ""
List of apertures to be selected from the images for listing.  A null
list selects all apertures.  See \fBranges\fR for the syntax of
this list.
.le
.ls long_header = no
If set to yes, then a multiline listing of the header elements is given.
If set to no, then a single line per spectrum is given.  The contents
of the listing depend on the format.

DESCRIPTION
This task lists header information from apertures in a list of input
images.  There is a short one line per spectrum listing and a more
extended listing selected by the \fIlong_header\fR parameter.

In both short and long outputs the aperture information consists of
lines with the following whitespace separated fields: the image line,
the aperture number, the beam number, the dispersion type, the
wavelength of the first pixel, the wavelength interval per pixel,
the number of valid pixels, and the aperture title.  The dispersion
type is an integer with a value of -1 if not dispersion corrected,
0 if dispersion corrected to a linear wavelength sampling, 1 if
dispersion corrected to a log wavelength sampling, and 2 if dispersion
corrected to a nonlinear sampling.  The wavelength per pixel is
an approximation based on the wavelength endpoints divided by the
number of pixels in the case of a nonlinear dispersion function.
Also the wavelengths refer to the actual pixels taking any image sections
into account and so may differ from the coordinate system information in
the header which is defined for the original physical coordinates.
The aperture titles may be identical with the image title if individual
aperture titles are not defined.

In the short output format the image title is given first followed
by the above described information.  This format is compact and
suitable for easy use in other programs (see the example below).
The long output format is blocked by image and gives the image name
and title on the first line, the exposure time, universal time,
and siderial time on the second line, the right ascention, declination,
hour angle, and airmass on the third line, and then the individual
aperture information on the remaining lines.  If some of the header
information is missing a value of INDEF is printed.  The keywords used
are EXPTIME/ITIME/EXPOSURE (in that order) for the exposure time,
and UT, ST, RA, DEC, HA, and AIRMASS for the remaining values.

    demoobj.ms: Hydra artificial image
	EXPTIME = 2133.33 UT = 9:10:09.0    ST = 20:09:34.0
	RA = 1:34:02.00   DEC = 30:37:03.0  HA = INDEF    AIRMASS = 2.3

EXAMPLES
1.  List short header for an object and arc from a Hydra multifiber reduction
for fibers 36 to 39.

.nf
    cl> slist demoobj.ms,demoarc1.ms ap=36-39
    demoobj.ms 1 37 0 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 Sky fiber
    demoobj.ms 2 38 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS313
    demoobj.ms 3 39 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS444
    demoarc1.ms 1 36 2 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 Arc fiber
    demoarc1.ms 2 37 0 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 Sky fiber
    demoarc1.ms 3 38 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS313
    demoarc1.ms 4 39 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS444
.fi

Note that fiber 37 is the first image line in demoobj.ms and teh second image
line in demoarc.ms.  The dispersion is the same in all fibers by design.

2.  List long headers for the two images of example 1 but restricted to
apertures 38 and 39.

.nf
    cl> slist demoobj.ms,demoarc1.ms ap=38,39 l+
    demoobj.ms: Hydra artificial image
	EXPTIME = 2133.33 UT = 9:10:09.0    ST = 20:09:34.0
	RA = 1:34:02.00   DEC = 30:37:03.0  HA = INDEF    AIRMASS = 2.3
        2 38 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS313
	3 39 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS444
    demoarc1.ms: Hydra artificial image
	EXPTIME = 2133.33 UT = 9:10:09.0    ST = 20:09:34.0
	RA = 1:34:02.00   DEC = 30:37:03.0  HA = INDEF    AIRMASS = 2.3
        3 38 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS313
	4 39 1 0 5785.85 6.140271 256 SS444
.fi

The other header parameters are the same because this is artificial
data using the same template header.

3.  Dump the set of image headers on a printer in long format.

.nf
    cl> slist *.ms.imh l+ | lprint
.fi

4.  The short form of SLIST may be used to get some of the aperture
information for use in a script.  The following simply prints the
image line corresponding to a specified aperture.  In a real application
something more complex would be done.

.nf
	procedure example (images, aperture)

	string	images		{prompt="List of images"}
	int	aperture	{prompt="Aperture"}

	begin
		string temp, image
		int	line

		# Use SLIST to print to a temporary file.
		temp = mktemp ("example")
		slist (images, aperture=aperture, long=no, > temp)

		# Scan each line and print the line number.
		list = temp
		while (fscan (list, image, line) != EOF)
		    print (image, ": ", line)
		list = ""
		delete (temp, verify=no)
	end
.fi

REVISIONS
.ls SLIST V2.10
This task was revised to be relevant for the current spectral image
formats.  The old version is still available in the IRS/IIDS package.
