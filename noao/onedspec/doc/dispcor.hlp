NAME
dispcor -- Dispersion correct and resample spectra
.ih
USAGE
dispcor input output [records]
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input spectra or root names to be dispersion corrected.  These may
be echelle or non-echelle spectra, the task will determine which from the
database dispersion functions.  When using the record number extension
format, record number extensions will be appended to each root name in the
list.
.le
.ls output
List of dispersion corrected output spectra or root names.  When using the
record number extension format, record number extensions will be appended
to each root name in the list.  The output extension will be the same as
the input extension.  If "no" output list is specified then the output
spectrum will replace the input spectrum after dispersion correction.
.le
.ls records (imred.irs and imred.iids only)
List of records or ranges of records to be appended to the input and output
root names when using record number extension format.  The syntax of this
list is comma separated record numbers or ranges of record numbers.  A
range consists of two numbers separated by a hyphen.  A null list may be
used if no record number extensions are desired.  This is a positional
query parameter only if the record format is specified.
.le
.ls linearize = yes
Interpolate the spectra to a linear dispersion sampling?  If yes, the
spectra will be interpolated to a linear or log linear sampling using
the linear dispersion parameters specified by other parameters.  If
no, the nonlinear dispersion function(s) from the dispersion function
database are assigned to the input image world coordinate system
and the spectral data are not interpolated.
.le
.ls database = "database"
Database containing dispersion solutions created by \fBidentify\fR or
\fBecidentify\fR.  If the spectra have been previous dispersion corrected
this parameter is ignored unless a new reference spectra are defined.
.le
.ls table = ""
Wavelength coordinate table or reference image.  Elements in this optional
table or reference image override the wavelength coordinates given below
for specified apertures.  See the DISCUSSION for additional information.
.le
.ls w1 = INDEF, w2 = INDEF, dw = INDEF, nw = INDEF
The starting wavelength, ending wavelength, wavelength interval per pixel,
and the number of pixels in the output spectra.  Any combination of these
parameters may be used to restrict the wavelength coordinates of the output
spectra.  If two or more have the value INDEF then suitable defaults based
on the number of input pixels and the wavelength range of the reference
dispersion solutions are used.  These defaults may either come from all
spectra, all spectra of the same aperture, or individually for each
spectrum depending on the values of the \fIglobal\fR and \fIsamedisp\fR
parameters.  Note that these parameters are specified in linear units even
if a logarithmic wavelength scale is selected.  The conversion between
linear and logarithmic intervals between pixels is given below.  These
values may be overridden for specified apertures by a wavelength table or
reference image.  Otherwise these values apply to all apertures.
.le
.ls log = no
Transform to linear logarithmic wavelength coordinates?  Linear logarithmic
wavelength coordinates have wavelength intervals which are constant
in the logarithm (base 10) of the wavelength.  Note that if conserving flux
this will change the flux units to flux per log lambda interval.
Note that if the input spectra are in log sampling then \fIlog\fR=no will
resample back to linear sampling and \fIlog\fR=yes will resample keeping
the output spectra in log sampling.
.le
.ls flux = yes
Conserve the total flux during interpolation rather than the flux density?
If "no", the output spectrum is average of the input spectrum across each
output wavelength coordinate.  This conserves flux density.  If "yes" the
input spectrum is integrated over the extent of each output pixel.  This
conserves the total flux.  Note that in this case units of the flux will
change; for example rebinning to logarithmic wavelengths will produce flux
per log lambda.  For flux calibrated data you most likely would not want to
conserve flux.
.le
.ls blank = 0.
Output value corresponding to points outside the range of the input
data.  In other words, the out of bounds value.  This only has an
effect when linearizing and the output spectral coordinates extend
beyond the input spectral range.
.le
.ls samedisp = no
Use the same dispersion parameters for all apertures?  If yes then all
apertures in a single image will have the same dispersion parameters.
If the \fIglobal\fR parameter is all selected then all spectra in all
images will have the same dispersion paramters.  This parameter
would not normally be used with echelle spectra where each order
has a different wavelength coverage.
.le
.ls global = no
Apply global wavelength defaults?  Defaults for the INDEF wavelength
coordinate parameters are determined if two or less of the wavelength
parameters are specified.  The defaults are based on the number of
pixels and the wavelengths of the first and last pixel as given by the
dispersion solution.  If this parameter is "no" this is done
independently for each input spectrum.  If this parameter is "yes"
then the maximum number of pixels and the minimum and maximum
wavelengths of all the input spectra or those of the same aperture are
used to provide defaults for the spectra.  The parameter
\fIsamedisp\fR determines whether the global coordinates are over all
spectra or only those with the same aperture number.  The global option
is used to have all the dispersion corrected spectra have the same
wavelength coordinates without actually specifying the wavelength
parameters.
.le
.ls ignoreaps = no
If a reference dispersion solution is not found for an aperture
use the first reference dispersion solution and ignore the aperture
number?  If not ignoring the apertures all spectra must have a matching
aperture for the dispersion solution and the task aborts if this is
not the case.  Ignoring the apertures avoids this abort and instead
the first dispersion solution is used.  Note this parameter does not
mean ignore matches between reference and spectrum aperture numbers
but only ignore the aperture number if no matching reference is
found.

Also if a reference table or image is given and \fIignoreaps\fR=yes
then the default dispersion parameters for any aperture not defined
by the table or image will be that of the first defined aperture.
This can still be overridden by giving explicit values for
\fIw1, w2, dw\fR and \fInw\fR.
.le
.ls confirm = no
Confirm the wavelength parameters for each spectrum?  If \fIyes\fR
the wavelength parameters will be printed and the user will be asked
whether to accept them.  If the parameters are not acceptable the
user will be queried for new values.  The confirmation and parameter
changes are repeated until an acceptable set of parameters is obtained.
When the \fIglobal\fR parameter is \fIyes\fR changes to the wavelength
parameters will remain in effect until changed again.
.le
.ls listonly = no
List the dispersion coordinates only?  If set then the dispersion coordinates
are listed but the spectra are not dispersion corrected.  This may be used
to determine what the default wavelengths would be based on the dispersion
solutions.
.le
.ls verbose = yes
Print the dispersion function and coordinate assignments?
.le
.ls logfile = ""
Log file for recording the dispersion correction operations.  If no file
name is given then no log information is recorded.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The dispersion coordinate systems of the input spectra are set or changed
in the output spectra.  The output spectra may be the same as the input
spectra if no output spectra are specified or the output name is the
same as the input name.  The input and output spectra are specified
by image templates or lists.  In the \fBirs/iids\fR packages the
input and output spectra are specified as root names and the record
numbers are specified by the \fIrecord\fR parameter.  The records are
given as a set of comma separate single numbers or ranges of hyphen
separated numbers.  If no records are specified then the input and output
images are assumed to be full names.

The dispersion coordinate system is defined either in the image header or
by dispersion functions in the specified database.  To use reference
spectra dispersion functions they must first be assigned to the image with
\fBidentify (reidentify)\fR, \fBecidentify (ecreidentify)\fR,
\fBrefspectra\fR, or \fBhedit\fR.  These tasks define the image header
keywords REFSPEC1, REFSPEC2, REFSHFT1, and REFSHFT2.  The test which
determines whether to use the current dispersion coordinate system or
reference spectra dispersion solutions is the presence of the REFSPEC1
keyword.  Since it is an error to apply a dispersion function to data which
have already been dispersion corrected the any dispersion function keywords
are deleted after use and a record of them entered in sequential image
header keywords beginning with DCLOG.

Dispersion functions are specified by one or both of the reference spectrum
image header keywords REFSPEC1 and REFSPEC2 containing the name of
calibration spectra with dispersion function solutions (either echelle
dispersion functions from \fBecidentify\fR or non-echelle dispersion
functions from \fBidentify\fR) in the database.  There must be a dispersion
function for each aperture in the input spectrum unless the \fIignoreaps\fR
flag is set.  If the flag is not set the task will abort if a matching
aperture is not found while if it is set spectra without a matching
aperture in the reference dispersion solutions will use the first
dispersion solution.  Note that aperture number matching is done in both
cases and the \fIignoreaps\fR parameter only applies to non-matching
spectra.  The common situation for using the \fIignoreaps\fR option is when
there is a single reference dispersion solution which is to be applied to a
number of spectra with different aperture numbers; hence effectively
ignoring the reference spectrum aperture number.

If two reference spectra are specified the names may be followed by a
weighting factor (assumed to be 1 if missing).  The wavelength of a pixel
is then the weighted averge of the wavelengths of the two dispersion
functions.  The task \fBrefspectra\fR provides a number of ways to assign
reference spectra.  Note, however, that these assignments may be made
directly using the task \fBhedit\fR or with some other task or script if
none of the methods are suitable.  Also note that \fBidentify\fR and
\fBreidentify\fR add the REFSPEC1 keyword refering to the image itself
when a database entry is written.

In addition to the one or two reference dispersion functions for each input
aperture there may also be image header keywords REFSHFT1 and REFSHFT2
specifying reference spectra whose dispersion function zero point shifts
(the "shift" parameter in the database files) are to be applied to the
reference dispersion functions.  The shifts from REFSHFT1 will be applied
to the dispersion functions from REFSPEC1 and similarly for the second
dispersion functions.  The reference shifts need not be present for every
aperture in a multispectrum image.  By default the mean shift from all the
reference apertures having a zero point shift is applied to all the
reference dispersion functions.  If the REFSHFT keyword has the modifier
word "nearest" following the spectrum name then the shift from the nearest
aperture in spatial position (from the aperture extraction limits in the
original 2D spectrum as recorded in the 6th and 7th fields of the APNUM
keywords) is used for a particular input aperture.  If the modifier word is
"interp" then the nearest two apertures are used to interpolate a zero
point shift spatially.

The purpose of the reference shift keywords is to apply a wavelength zero
point correction to the reference dispersion functions determined from
separate arc calibration observations using a few apertures taken at the
same time as object observations.  For example, consider multifiber
observations in which one or more fibers are assigned to arc lamps at the
same time the other fibers are used to observe various objects.  The basic
dispersion reference, the REFSPEC keywords, will come from arc observations
taken through all the fibers.  The arc fibers used during an object
observation are then calibrated against their corresponding fibers in the
arc calibration observations to determine a zero point shift.  The REFSHFT
keywords will contain the name of the object spectrum itself and the shifts
from the simultaneous arc fibers will be interpolated spatially to the
nonarc object fibers and applied to the dispersion functions from the arc
calibrations for those fibers.

The reference shift keywords are currently added with \fBhedit\fR and zero
point shifts computed with \fBidentify/reidentify\fR.  The complexities of
this have been hidden in the multifiber \fBimred\fR instrument reduction
packages.  The reference shift correction feature was added primarily for
use in those reduction packages.

If the \fIlinearize\fR parameter is no the dispersion functions, weights,
and shifts are transferred from the database to the world coordinate system
keywords in the image header.  Except for printing processing information
that is all that is done to the spectra.

If the \fIlinearize\fR parameter is yes the spectra are interpolated to a
linear wavelength scale and the dispersion coordinate system in the header
is set apprpriately.  A linear wavelength coordinate system is defined by a
starting wavelength, an ending wavelength, a wavelength interval per pixel,
and the number of pixels.  These four parameters actually overspecify the
coordinate system and only three of these values are needed to define it.
The output coordinate system is specified by giving a set or subset of
these parameters using the parameters \fIw1\fR, \fIw2\fR, \fIdw\fR, and
\fInw\fR.

When the \fIlog\fR option is used these parameters are still specified and
computed in non-log units but the effective interval per pixel is

.nf
	dw_log = (log10(w2) - log10(w1)) / (nw - 1)
	dw_log = (log10(w1+dw*(nw-1)) - log10(w1)) / (nw - 1)
.fi

In other words, the logarithmic interval divides the starting and ending
wavelength into the required number of pixels in log step.  To avoid
confusion in this case it is best to specify the starting and ending
wavelengths (in non-log units) and the number of pixels.

Note that if \fIlog\fR=yes the input spectra in either linear
or log sampling will be resampled to produces an output spectrum in
log sampling.  Similarly, if \fIlog\fR=no the input spectra will
be resampled to linear sampling.  This means that log sampled input
spectra will be resampled to linear sampling.

Default values for any parameters which are not specified, by using the
value INDEF, are supplied based on the wavelengths of the first and last
pixel as given by the dispersion function and the number of pixels in the
input image.  The defaults may either be determined separately for each
spectrum (\fIglobal\fR = \fIno\fR), from all spectra with the same aperture
(\fIglobal\fR = \fIyes\fR and \fIsamedisp\fR = \fIno\fR), or from all the
spectra (\fIglobal\fR = \fIyes\fR and \fIsamedisp\fR = \fIyes\fR).  As
indicated, the parameter \fIsamedisp\fR determines whether defaults are
determined independently for each aperture or set the same for all
apertures.

Another way to specify the wavelengths when there are many apertures is to
use a wavelength table or reference image.  If an spectrum image name is
specified with the \fItable\fR parameter then the dispersion parameters for
each apertures are set to be the same as the reference spectrum.
Alternatively, a text file table consisting of lines containing an aperture
number, the starting wavelength, the ending wavelength, the wavelength
interval per pixel, and the number of output pixels may be specified.  Any
of these values may be specified as INDEF (though usually the aperture
number is not).  One way to view the wavelength table/reference spectrum is
that an entry in the wavelength table/reference spectrum overrides the
values of the parameters \fIw1\fR, \fIw2\fR, \fIdw\fR, and \fInw\fR, which
normally apply to all apertures, for the specified aperture.  The
wavelength table is used to specify explicit independent values for
apertures.  The global mechanism can supply independent values for the
INDEF parameters when the \fIsamedisp\fR parameter is no.

If one wishes to verify and possibly change the defaults assigned,
either globally or individually, the \fIconfirm\fR flag may be set.  The
user is asked whether to accept these values.  By responding with no the
user is given the chance to change each parameter value.  Then the new
parameters are printed and the user is again asked to confirm the
parameters.  This is repeated until the desired parameters are set.  When
the defaults are not global the changed parameters will not be used for the
next spectrum.  When the global option is used any changes made are
retained (either for all apertures or independently for each aperture)
until changed again.

When adjusting the wavelengths the user should specify which parameter is
free to change by entering INDEF.  If none of the parameters are specified
as INDEF then those values which were not changed, i.e. by accepting the
current value, are the first to be changed.

Once the wavelength scale has been defined the input spectrum is
interpolated for each output pixel.  Output wavelengths outside the range
of the input spectrum are set to the value given by the \fIblank\fR parameter
value.  The default interpolation function
is a 5th order polynomial.  The choice of interpolation type is made
with the package parameter "interp".  It may be set to "nearest",
"linear", "spline3", "poly5", or "sinc".  Remember that this
applies to all tasks which might need to interpolate spectra in the
\fBonedspec\fR and associated packages.  For a discussion of interpolation
types see \fBonedspec\fR.

When it is desired to conserve total flux, particularly when the dispersion is
significantly reduced, the parameter \fIflux\fR is set to yes and the
output pixel value is obtained by integrating the interpolation function
across the wavelength limits of the output pixel.  If it is set to no
then the flux density is conserved by averaging across the output pixel
limits.

The input spectrum name, reference spectra, and the wavelength parameters
will be printed on the standard output if the \fIverbose\fR parameter is
set and printed to a log file if one is specified with the \fIlogfile\fR
parameter.  If one wishes to only check what wavelengths will be determined
for the defaults without actually dispersion correcting the spectra the
\fIlistonly\fR flag may be set.

Other tasks which may be used to change the dispersion coordinate system
are \fBscopy\fR, \fBspecshift\fR, and \fBsapertures\fR.

EXAMPLES
In the examples when the task is used in the IRS and IIDS packages,
shown with the "ir>" prompt the spectra have a record number extension
image name format and the records parameter must be specified.  In
the other case shown with the "on>" prompt the records parameter is
not used.

REVISIONS
.ls DISPCOR V2.12.3
Added the blank parameter value.
.le
.ls DISPCOR V2.11.3
Long slit and data cubes can be used with this task to either resample
using the existing WCS or to use a single dispersion function from
IDENTIFY.  It uses the first one found.
.le
.ls DISPCOR V2.10.3
Provision was added for IDENTIFY dispersion solutions consisting of
only a shift (as produced by the 'g' key in IDENTIFY or the refit=no
flag in REIDENTIFY) to be applied to previously LINEARIZED spectra.
Thus it is possible to use IDENIFY/REIDENTIFY to automatically
compute a zero point shift based on 1 or more lines and then shift
all the spectra to that zero point.

DISPCOR will now allow multiple uses of IDENTIFY dispersion solutions
in a simple way with but with continuing protection against accidental
multiple uses of the same dispersion solutions.  When a spectrum is
first dispersion corrected using one or more reference spectra keywords
the dispersion flag is set and the reference spectra keywords are moved to
DCLOGn keywords.  If DISPCOR is called again without setting new
reference spectra keywords then the spectra are resampled (rebinned)
using the current coordinate system.  If new reference spectra are set
then DISPCOR will apply these new dispersion functions.  Thus the user
now explicitly enables multiple dispersion functions by adding
reference spectra keywords and DISPCOR eliminates accidental multiple
uses of the same dispersion function by renaming the reference
spectra.  The renamed keywords also provide a history.

The flux conservation option now computes an average across the
output pixel rather than interpolating to the middle of the output
pixel when \fIflux\fR is no.  This preserves the flux density and
includes all the data; i.e. a coarse resampling will not eliminate
features which don't fall at the output pixel coordinates.

Some additional log and verbose output was added to better inform the
user about what is done.

Better error information is now printed if a database dispersion function
is not found.
.le
.ls DISPCOR V2.10
This is a new version with many differences.  It replaces the previous
three tasks \fBdispcor, ecdispcor\fR and \fBmsdispcor\fR.  It applies both
one dimensional and echelle dispersion functions.  The new parameter
\fIlinearize\fR selects whether to interpolate the spectra to a uniform
linear dispersion (the only option available previously) or to assign a
nonlinear dispersion function to the image without any interpolation.  The
interpolation function parameter has been eliminated and the package
parameter \fIinterp\fR is used to select the interpolation function.  The
new interpolation type "sinc" may be used but care should be exercised.
The new task supports applying a secondary zero point shift spectrum to a
master dispersion function and a spatial interpolation of the shifts when
calibration spectra are taken at the same time on a different region of the
same 2D image.  The optional wavelength table may now also be an image to
match dispersion parameters.  The \fIapertures\fR and \fIrebin\fR
parameters have been eliminated.  If an input spectrum has been previously
dispersion corrected it will be resampled as desired.  Verbose and log file
parameters have been added to log the dispersion operations as desired.
The record format syntax is available in the \fBirs/iids\fR packages.
