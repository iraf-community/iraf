NAME
standard -- Add standard stars to sensitivity file
.ih
USAGE
standard input [records] output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input standard star spectra or root names if using the record number
extension format.  All spectra of the same aperture must be of the same
standard star.  In beam switch mode or when the same star parameter is set
all spectra must be of the same standard star regardless of aperture number.
Normally the spectra will not be extinction corrected but if they are
then the extinction file should also be given and the same extinction
file should be used with \fBsensfunc\fR.
.le
.ls records (imred.irs and imred.iids only)
List of records or ranges of records to be appended to the input spectra
names when using record number extension format.  The
syntax of this list is comma separated record numbers or ranges of record
numbers.  A range consists of two numbers separated by a hyphen.
A null list may be used if no record number extensions are
desired.  This is a positional query parameter only if the record
format is specified.
.le
.ls output
The name of a text file which will contain the output from \fBstandard\fR.
Each execution of \fBstandard\fR appends to this file information about the
standard stars, the calibration bandpasses, and observed counts (see the
DESCRIPTION section for more details).  The output must be explicitly
deleted by the user if the filename is to be reused.
.le
.ls samestar = yes
Is the same star in all apertures?  If set to no then each aperture may
contain a different standard star the the standard star name is queried
each time a new aperture is encountered.  Note that this occurs only
once per aperture and multiple spectra with the same aperture number
must be of the same star.  If set to yes the standard star name is only
queried once.  When in beam switch mode this parameter is ignored since
all apertures must contain the same star.
.le
.ls beam_switch = no
Beam switch the spectra?  If yes then a beam switch mode is used for the spectra
in which successive pairs of object and sky observations from the same aperture
are sky subtracted.  This requires that the object type flag OFLAG be present
and that the spectra are appropriately ordered.  All object observations must be
of the same standard star and the \fIsamestar\fR parameter is ignored.
.le
.ls apertures = ""
List of apertures to be selected from the input list of spectra.  If no list
is specified then all apertures are selected.  The syntax is the same as the
record number extensions.
.le
.ls bandwidth = INDEF, bandsep = INDEF
Bandpass widths and separations in wavelength units.  If INDEF then the
default bandpasses are those given in the standard star calibration
file.  If values for these parameters are specified then a default set
of bandpasses of equal width and separation are defined over the range
of the input spectrum.  In both cases the default bandpasses can be
changed interactively if desired.
.le
.ls fnuzero = 3.68e-20
The absolute flux per unit frequency at a magnitude of zero.  This is used
to convert the calibration  magnitudes to absolute flux by the formula

	Flux = fnuzero * 10. ** (-0.4 * magnitude)

The flux units are also determined by this parameter.  However, the
frequency to wavelength interval conversion assumes frequency in hertz.
The default value is based on a calibration of Vega at 5556 Angstroms of
3.52e-20 ergs/cm2/s/hz for a magnitude of 0.048.  This default value
is that used in earlier versions of this task which did not allow the
user to change this calibration.
.le
.ls extinction = <no default>
Extinction file used to make second order extinction corrections across
the bandpasses.  The default value is  redirected to the package
parameter of the same name.  See \fBlcalib\fR for a list of standard
extinction files.  Normally the input spectra will not be extinction
corrected.  But if they are this file will be used to remove the
extinction and then the same file should be specified in \fBsensfunc\fR.
Note that one can choose to use a null extinction file in both.
.le
.ls caldir = ")_.caldir"
Calibration directory containing standard star data.  The default is
redirected to the package parameter of the same name.  A list of
standard calibration directories may be obtained by listing the file
"onedstds$README"; for example:

	cl> page onedstds$README

The user may copy or create their own calibration files and specify
the directory.  The directory "" refers to the current working directory.
.le
.ls observatory = ")_.observatory"
Observatory at which the spectra were obtained if not specified in the
image header by the keyword OBSERVAT.  The default is a redirection to look
in the parameters for the parent package for a value.  The observatory may
be one of the observatories in the observatory database, "observatory" to
select the observatory defined by the environment variable "observatory" or
the parameter \fBobservatory.observatory\fR, or "obspars" to select the
current parameters set in the \fBobservatory\fR task.  See help for
\fBobservatory\fR for additional information.
.le
.ls interact = no
If set to no, then the default wavelength set (either that from the star
calibration file or the set given by the \fIbandwidth\fR and \fIbandsep\fR
parameters) is used to select wavelength points along the spectrum where the
sensitivity is measured. If set to yes, the spectra may be plotted
and the bandpasses adjusted.
.le
.ls graphics = "stdgraph"
Graphics output device for use with the interactive mode.  Normally this is
the user's graphics terminal.
.le
.ls cursor = ""
Graphics cursor input for use with the interactive mode.  When null the
standard graphics cursor is used otherwise the specified file is used.
.le
.ls star_name
The name of the star observed in the current series of spectra.  Calibration
data for the star must be in the specified calibration directory "caldir".
This is normally a interactive query parameter and should not be specified on
the command line unless all spectra are of the same standard star.
.le
.ls airmass, exptime
If the airmass and exposure time are not in the header nor can they be
determined from other keywords in the header then these query parameters
are used to request the airmass and exposure time.  The values are updated
in the image.
.le
.ls answer
Interactive query parameter.

DESCRIPTION
Observations of standard stars are integrated over calibration
bandpasses and written to an output file along with the associated
calibration fluxes from tabulated calibration data.  The output data
is used by the task \fBsensfunc\fR to determine the detector
sensitivity function and possibly the extinction.  The spectra are
required to be dispersion corrected.  The input spectra may be in
either "onedspec" or "echelle" format and may have many different
observation apertures.  The spectra may also be beam switched and use
the a record number extension format.

The input spectra are specified by a list of names or root names if using
the record number extension format.  In the latter case each name in the
list has each of the specified record numbers appended.  A subset of the
input spectra may be selected by their aperture numbers using the parameter
\fIapertures\fR.  The spectrum name, aperture number, and title are printed
to the standard output.  The airmass is required but if absent from the image
header it may be computed from the observation header parameters and the
latitude task parameter (normally obtained from the \fBobservatory\fR task).
If the airmass cannot be computed, due to missing keywords, then a
query is made for the airmass.  The airmass is then updated in the header.

The name of the standard star is obtained by querying the user.  If the
parameter \fIsamestar\fR is yes or beam switch mode is selected then
all spectra are assumed to be of the same standard star and the query
is made once.  If the parameter is no then a query is made for each
aperture.  This allows each aperture to contain a different standard
star.  Note however that multiple observations with the same aperture
number must be of the same standard star.

If the standard star name is not recognized a menu of the available
standard stars in the calibration directory, the file "standards.men",
is printed and then the query is repeated.  Thus, to get a list you can type
? or help.

The standard star names must map to a file containing tabulated
calibration data.  The calibration filename is formed from the star
name with blanks, "+",and "-" removed and converted to lower case and
the extension ".dat" added.  This name is appended to a calibration
directory, so the directory name must have an appropriate directory
delimiter such as "$" or "/".  Generally one of the system calibration
directories is used but one may copy and modify or create new
calibration files in a personal directory.  For the current working
directory the calibration directory is either null or "./".

The calibration files consist of lines with wavelengths in Angstroms,
calibration magnitudes, and bandpass widths in Angstroms.  The
magnitudes are converted to absolute flux per unit frequency using the
parameter \fIfnuzero\fR defined by

	Fnu = fnuzero * 10. ** (-0.4 * magnitude)

Thus, \fIfnuzero\fR is the flux at magnitude zero.  The flux units are
determined by this number.  The default value was chosen such that Vega
at 5556 Angstroms has a magnitude of 0.048 and a flux of 3.52e-20
ergs/cm2/s/hz.  This is the same value that was used by all previous
versions of this task.

The beam switch mode is selected with the \fIbeam_switch\fR parameter.
This mode requires that all apertures are of the same star, the header
keyword OFLAG be present to identify object and sky spectra, and that
the sequence of spectra specified are paired such that if an object
spectrum is encountered first the next spectrum for that aperture
(spectra from other apertures may appear in between) is a sky spectrum
or the reverse.  These restrictions are not fundamental but are made so
that this mode behaves the same as with the previous version of this
task.  The sky spectrum is subtracted from the object spectrum and the
result is then used in generating the observed intensities in the calibration
bandpasses.

If the spectra have been extinction corrected (EX-FLAG = 0) the
extinction correction is removed.  The specified extinction file is
used for this operation and so must be the same as that used when the
extinction correction was made.  The airmass is also required in this step
and, if needed to compute the airmass, the observatory specified in the
image or observatory parameter is used.  The
treatment of extinction in this task is subtle.  The aim of this task
is to produce observed integrated instrumental intensities without
extinction correction.  Thus, the extinction correction is removed from
extinctionn corrected spectra.  However, a correction is made for an
extinction gradient across the bandpasses.  This is done by applying an
extinction correction, integrating across the bandpass, and then
correcting the integrated intensity for the extinction at the center of
the bandpass.  An alternative way to look at this is that the integral
is weighted by the ratio of the extinction correction at each pixel to
the extinction correction at the center of the bandpass.  This
correction or weighting is why the extinction file and latitude are
parameters in this task even though for nonextinction corrected spectra
they appear not to be needed.

The observed instrumental intensities are integrated within a set of
bandpasses by summing the pixels using partial pixels at the bandpass
edges.  Initial bandpasses are defined in one of two ways.  A set of
evenly spaced bandpasses of constant width covering the range of the
input spectrum may be specified using the parameters \fIbandwidth\fR
and \fIbandsep\fR in the same units as the spectrum dispersion.  If
these parameters have the value INDEF then the bandpasses from the
calibration file which are entirely within the spectrum are selected.
Generally these bandpasses are the actual measured bandpasses though
one is free to make calibration files using estimated points.  The
calibration bandpasses are preferable because they have been directly
measured and they have been placed to avoid troubles with spectral
lines.  However, when the coverage or resolution is such that these
bandpasses do not allow a good determination of the instrumental
response the evenly spaced bandpasses may be needed.  The calibration
fluxes are linearly interpolated (or extrapolated) from the calibration
data points to the defined bandpasses.

Each spectrum adds a line to the output file containing the spectrum image
name, the sky spectrum image name if beam switching, the aperture or beam
number, the number of points in the spectrum, the exposure time, airmass,
wavelength range, and title.  If the airmass is not found in the image
header it is computed using the latitude parameter and observation
information from the header.  If the airmass cannot be computed, due to
missing keywords, then a query is made for the airmass.

Following the spectrum information, calibration data is added for each
bandpass.  The bandpass wavelength, absolute flux (per Angstrom),
bandpass width, and observed instrumental intensity in the bandpass are
added to the output file.  As discussed above, the observed intensity
does not include an extinction term but does apply a small correction
or weighting for the variation of the extinction across the bandpass.

The setting and editing of the bandpasses may be performed
interactively if the \fIinteract\fR flag is set.  In this case the user
is queried for each spectrum.  The answers to this query may be "no" or
"yes" to skip editing or edit the bandpasses for this spectrum, "NO" or
"YES" to skip or not skip editing all spectra of the same aperture with
no further queries for this aperture, and "NO!" or "YES!" to skip
editing or edit all spectra with no further queries.

When editing the bandpasses a graph of the spectrum is made with the
bandpasses plotted at the computed intensity per pixel.  The cursor and
colon commands available are summarized in the section CURSOR KEYS.
Basically bandpasses may be added or deleted and the current bandpass
data may be examined.  Additional keys allow the usual windowing and
cursor mode operations.  When satisfied with the bandpasses exit with
'q'.  The edited bandpasses for that aperture remain in effect until
changed again by the user.  Thus if there are many spectra from the
same aperture one may reply with "NO" to queries for the next spectra
to accept the current bandpasses for all other spectra of the same
aperture.

EXAMPLES
1.  To compile observations of three standard stars using a beam switched
instrument like the IIDS:

.nf
	cl> standard.recformat=yes
	cl> standard nite1 1001-1008 std beam_switch+ interact-
	[nite1.1001][0]: HZ 44 - Night 1
	[nite1.1004][0]: HZ 44 - Night 1
	[nite1.1005][0]: HZ 44 - Night 1
	[nite1.1008][0]: HZ 44 - Night 1
	Star name in calibration list: hz 44
	cl> standard nite1 1009-1016 std beam_switch+ interact-
		...
	cl> standard nite1 1017-1024 std beam_switch+ interact-
		...
.fi

This will create a file "std" which will contain sensitivity measurements
from the beam-switched observations of the three standard stars given.
Note that \fBstandard\fR is run separately for each standard star.

The spectra will be from the images: nite1.1001, nite.1002 ... nite1.1024,
and the default calibration file, "onedstds$irscal.dat" will be used.

2.  For echelle spectra all apertures, the orders, are of the same star and
so the samestar parameter is set.  Usually the resolution is much higher than
the calibration data so in order to get sufficient coverage bandpasses must
be interpolated from the calibration data.  Therefore the evenly spaced
bandpasses are used.

.nf
	cl> standard.recformat=no
	cl> standard.samestar=yes
	cl> standard ech001.ec std bandwidth=10 bandsep=15
	[ech001.ec][0]: Feige 110
	Star name in calibration list: feige 110
	[ech001.ec][0]: Edit bandpasses? (no|yes|NO|YES|NO!|YES!): yes
	[ech001.ec][1]: Edit bandpasses? (no|yes|NO|YES|NO!|YES!): yes
	[ech001.ec][2]: Edit bandpasses? (no|yes|NO|YES|NO!|YES!): NO!
