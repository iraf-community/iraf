NAME
sflip -- Flip data and/or dispersion coordinates in spectra
.ih
USAGE
sflip input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images containing spectra to be flipped.
.le
.ls output
Matching list of output image names for flipped spectra.
If no list is specified then the flipped spectra will replace the input
spectra.  If the output image name matching an input image name is the
same then the flipped spectrum will replace the original spectrum.
.le
.ls coord_flip = no
Flip the dispersion coordinates?  If yes then the relationship between the
logical pixel coordinates and the dispersion coordinates will be reversed so
that the dispersion coordinate of the first pixel of the output image will
correspond to the coordinate of the last pixel in the input image and
vice-versa for the other endpoint pixel.  The physical coordinates
will also be flipped.  Only the coordinate system along the dispersion
axis is flipped.
.le
.ls data_flip = yes
Flip the order of the data pixels as they are stored in the image along
the dispersion axis?  If yes then the first pixel in the input spectrum
becomes the last pixel in the output spectrum along the dispersion
axis of the image.

DESCRIPTION
The dispersion coordinate system and/or the data in the spectra specified
by the input list of images are flipped and stored in the matching output
image given in the output list of images.  If the output image list is left
blank or an output image name is the same as an input image name then the
operation is done so that the flipped spectra in the image replace the
original spectra.  All of the supported spectrum types are allowed; one
dimensional images, collections of spectra in multispec format, and two and
three dimensional spatial spectra in which one axis is dispersion.  In all
cases the flipping affects only the dispersion axis of the image as
specified by the DISPAXIS header keyword or the "dispaxis" parameter.  The
parameters \fIcoord_flip\fR and \fIdata_flip\fR select whether the
coordinate system and data are flipped.  If neither operation is selected
then the output spectra will simply be copies of the input spectra.

Flipping of the coordinate system means that the relation between
"logical" pixel coordinates (the index system of the image array)
and the dispersion and physical coordinate systems is reversed.
The dispersion coordinate of the first pixel in the flipped spectrum
will be the same as the dispersion coordinate of the last pixel
in the original spectrum and vice-versa for the other endpoint.

Flipping of the data means that the order in which the pixels are stored
in the image file is reversed along the image axis corresponding to
the dispersion.

While flipping spectra seems simple there are some subtleties.  If
both the coordinate system and the data are flipped then plots of
the spectra in which the dispersion coordinates are shown will appear
the same as in the original spectra.  In particular the coordinate
of a feature in the spectrum will remain unchanged.  In contrast
flipping either the coordinate system or the data will cause features
in the spectrum to move to opposite ends of the spectrum relative
to the dispersion coordinates.

Since plotting programs often plot the dispersion axis in some standard way
such as increasing from left to right, flipping both the dispersion
coordinates and the data will produce plots that look identical even though
the order of the points plotted will be reversed.  Only if the spectra are
plotted against logical pixel coordinates will a change be evident.  Note
also that the plotting programs themselves have options to reverse the
displayed graph.  So if all one wants is to reverse the direction of
increasing dispersion in a plot then physically flipping of the spectra is
not generally necessary.

Flipping of both the coordinate system and the data is also equivalent
to using an image section with a reversed axis.  For example
a one dimensional spectrum can be flipped in both dispersion coordinates
and data pixel order by

.nf
    cl> imcopy spec1[-*] spec2
.fi

Higher dimensional spectra need appropriate dimensions in the image
sections.  One advantage of \fBsflip\fR is that it will determine the
appropriate dispersion axis itself.

EXAMPLES
In the following the spectra can be one dimensional, multispec,
long slit, or spectral data cubes.

.nf
    cl> sflip spec1 spec1f		# Flip data to new image
    cl> sflip spec1 spec1		# Flip data to same image
    cl> sflip spec1 spec1f coord+ data-	# Flip coordinates and not data
    cl> sflip spec1 spec1f coord+ 	# Flip both coordinates and data
    cl> sflip spec* f//spec*		# Flip a list of images
.fi

REVISIONS
.ls SFLIP V2.10.4
New in this release.  Note that the V2.9 SFLIP was different in that
it was script which simply flipped the data.  Coordinate systems were
not handled in the same way.
