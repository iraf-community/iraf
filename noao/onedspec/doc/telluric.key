		TELLURIC COMMAND SUMMARY

a - automatic RMS minimization within sample regions
c - toggle calibration spectrum display
d - toggle data spectrum display
e - expand (double) the step for the current selection
q - quit
r - redraw the graphs
s - add or reset sample regions
w - window commands (see :/help for additional information)
x - graph and select from corrected shifted candidates
y - graph and select from corrected scaled candidates

:help           - print help
:shift  [value] - print or reset the current shift
:scale  [value] - print or reset the current scale
:dshift [value] - print or reset the current shift step
:dscale [value] - print or reset the current scale step
:offset [value] - print or reset the current offset between spectra
:sample [value] - print or reset the sample regions
:smooth [value] - print or reset the smoothing box size


The stacked display shows three corrected candidate spectra.  The center
one is for the current shift and scale and the other two are one step
higher or lower in the shift or scale.  The current values and the
step is shown in the title.  Toggle between the shift and scale candidates
with 'x' or 'y'.  Select the best spectrum with the cursor and typing
'x' or 'y'.  Selecting the middle spectrum with 'x' in the shift display
divides the shift step in half.  Selecting one of the other spectra
changes the current shift.  Selecting the middle spectrum with 'y'
in the scale display divides the scale step in half.  Selecting one of
the other spectra changes the current scale.  When 'q' is typed the
final shift and scale will be that of the middle spectrum.
