PARAMETERS
.ls observatory = "observatory"
Observatory at which the spectra were obtained if not specified in the
image header by the keyword OBSERVAT.  This parameter is used by several
tasks in the package through parameter redirection so this parameter may be
used to affect all these tasks at the same time.  The observatory may be
one of the observatories in the observatory database, "observatory" to
select the observatory defined by the environment variable "observatory" or
the parameter \fBobservatory.observatory\fR, or "obspars" to select the
current parameters set in the \fBobservatory\fR task.  See help for
\fBobservatory\fR for additional information.
.le
.ls caldir = ""
Calibration directory containing standard star data.  This parameter
is used by several tasks in the package through redirection.  A list of
standard calibration directories may be obtained by listing the file
"onedstds$README"; for example:

	cl> page onedstds$README

The user may copy or create their own calibration files and specify
the directory.  The directory "" refers to the current working directory.
.le
.ls interp = "poly5" (nearest|linear|poly3|poly5|spline3|sinc)
Spectrum interpolation type used when spectra are resampled.  The choices are:

.nf
	nearest - nearest neighbor
	 linear - linear
	  poly3 - 3rd order polynomial
	  poly5 - 5th order polynomial
	spline3 - cubic spline
	   sinc - sinc function
.fi
.le

The following parameters apply to two and three dimensional images
such as long slit or Fabry-Perot spectra.  They allow selection of
a line or column as the spectrum "aperture" and summing of neighboring
elements to form a one dimensional spectrum as the tasks in the
ONEDSPEC package expect.

.ls dispaxis = 1
The image axis corresponding to the dispersion.  If there is an image
header keyword DISPAXIS then the value of the keyword will be used
otherwise this package parameter is used.  The dispersion coordinates
are a function of column, line, or band when this parameter is 1, 2
or 3.
.le
.ls nsum = "1"
The number of neighboring elements to sum.  This is a string parameter
that can have one or two numbers.  For two dimensional images only
one number is needed and specifies the number of lines or columns
to sum depending on the dispersion axis.  For three dimensional
images two numbers may be given (if only one is given it defaults
to the same value for both spatial axes) to specify the summing of
the two spatial axes.  The order is the lower dimensional spatial
axis first.

For an even value the elements summed are the central specified
"aperture", nsum / 2 - 1 below, and nsum /2 above; i.e the
central value is closer to the lower element than the upper.
For example, for nsum=4 and an aperture of 10 for a dispersion
axis of 1 in a two dimensional image the spectrum used will be
the sum of lines 9 to 12.
.le

.ls records = ""
This is a dummy parameter.  It is applicable only in the \fBimred.irs\fR
and \fBimred.iids\fR packages.
.le
.ls version = "ONEDSPEC V3: November 1991"
Package version identification.

There are other packages which provide additional functions or specialized
tasks for spectra.  Radial velocity measurements are available in the
\fBnoao.rv\fR package.  The \fBnoao.imred\fR package contains a number
of packages for specific types of data or instruments.  These packages
are listed in Table 2.

INTERPOLATION
Changing the dispersion sampling of spectra, such as when converting to a
constant sampling interval per pixel or a common sampling for combining or
doing arithmetic on spectra, requires interpolation.  The tasks which
reinterpolate spectra, if needed, are \fBdispcor, sarith, scombine,\fR and
\fBsplot\fR.

The interpolation type is set by the package parameter \fIinterp\fR.
The available interpolation types are:

.nf
	nearest - nearest neighbor
	 linear - linear
	  poly3 - 3rd order polynomial
	  poly5 - 5th order polynomial
	spline3 - cubic spline
	   sinc - sinc function
.fi

The default interpolation type is a 5th order polynomial.

The choice of interpolation type depends on the type of data, smooth
verses strong, sharp, undersampled features, and the requirements of
the user.  The "nearest" and "linear" interpolation are somewhat
crude and simple but they avoid "ringing" near sharp features.  The
polynomial interpolations are smoother but have noticible ringing
near sharp features.  They are, unlike the sinc function described
below, localized.

In V2.10 a "sinc" interpolation option is available.  This function
has advantages and disadvantages.  It is important to realize that
there are disadvantages!  Sinc interpolation approximates applying a phase
shift to the fourier transform of the spectrum.  Thus, repeated
interpolations do not accumulate errors (or nearly so) and, in particular,
a forward and reverse interpolation will recover the original spectrum
much more closely than other interpolation types.  However, for
undersampled, strong features, such as cosmic rays or narrow emission or
absorption lines, the ringing can be more severe than the polynomial
interpolations.  The ringing is especially a concern because it extends
a long way from the feature causing the ringing; 30 pixels with the
truncated algorithm used.  Note that it is not the truncation of the
interpolation function which is at fault!

Because of the problems seen with sinc interpolation it should be used with
care.  Specifically, if there are no undersampled, narrow features it is a
good choice but when there are such features the contamination of the
spectrum by ringing is much more severe than with other interpolation
types.

UNITS
In versions of the NOAO spectroscopy packages prior to V2.10 the dispersion
units used were restricted to Angstroms.  In V2.10 the first,
experimental, step of generalizing to other units was taken by
allowing the two principle spectral plotting tasks, \fBsplot\fR and
\fBspecplot\fR, to plot in various units.  Dispersion functions are still
assumed to be in Angstroms but in the future the generalization will be
completed to all the NOAO spectroscopy tasks.

The dispersion units capability of the plotting tasks allows specifying
the units with the "units" task parameter and interactively changing the
units with the ":units" command.  In addition the 'v' key allows plotting
in velocity units with the zero point velocity defined by the cursor
position.

The units are specified by strings having a unit type from the list below
along with the possible preceding modifiers, "inverse", to select the
inverse of the unit and "log" to select logarithmic units. For example "log
angstroms" to plot the logarithm of wavelength in Angstroms and "inv
microns" to plot inverse microns.  The various identifiers may be
abbreviated as words but the syntax is not sophisticated enough to
recognized standard scientific abbreviations except as noted below.

.nf

The velocity and redshift units require a trailing value and unit defining the
velocity zero point.  For example to plot velocity relative to
a wavelength of 1 micron the unit string would be:

.nf
	km/s 1 micron
.fi

Some additional examples of units strings are:

.nf
	milliang
	megahertz
	inv mic
	log hertz
	m/s 3 inv mic
	z 5015 ang
