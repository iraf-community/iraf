scombine:
    1.  Combine with weights:
	    By signal level
	    By sigma spectrum

doc:
    Install SENSFUNC memo in the doc directory. (8/14)

calibrate:
    Have calibrate apply neutral density filter function.  This may also
    have to be included in STANDARD and SENSFUNC. (2/25/87)

splot:
    Add a deblend option for PCYGNI profiles. (Tyson, 3/19/87)

Tim Heckman (U. Maryland) came by with questions and requests
concerning deblending in SPLOT.  Tim's comments are indicated in
quotations.

2. "The deblending should allow additional constraints if known.
Specifically fixing the ratios of lines based on atomic physics."

3.  "The deblending should provide some uncertainty estimates."  I added
that there has also been a request to use known statistics in the
pixel data themselves to generate uncertainty estimates.

4.  "It would be useful to provide other choices for the profile rather
than just gaussians."
