NAME
scopy -- Select and copy spectra
.ih
USAGE
scopy input output
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input images containing spectra to be copied.
.le
.ls output
List of output image names or root names.  Image
sections are ignored and if the output format is "onedspec" then any record
extensions are stripped to form the root name.  If no output list is
specified then the input list is used and the input images are replaced by
the copied output spectra.  If a single output name is specified then all
copied spectra are written to the same output image or image root
name.  This allows packing or merging multiple spectra and requires
properly setting the \fIclobber\fR, \fImerge\fR, \fIrenumber\fR and
\fIoffset\fR parameters to achieve the desired output.  If more than one
output image is specified then it must match the input image list in
number.
.le
.ls w1 = INDEF, w2 = INDEF
Starting and ending wavelengths to be copied.  If \fIw1\fR is not specified
then the wavelength of the starting edge of the first pixel is used
(wavelength at pixel coordinate 0.5) and if \fIw2\fR is not specified then
the wavelength of the ending edge of the last pixel is used (wavelength of
the last pixel plus 0.5).  If both are not specified, that is set to INDEF,
then the whole spectrum is copied and the \fIrebin\fR parameter is
ignored.  Note that by specifying both endpoints the copied region can be
set to have increasing or decreasing wavelength per pixel.  If the spectrum
only partially covers the specified range only that portion of the spectrum
within the range is copied.  It is an error if the range is entirely
outside that of a spectrum.
.le
.ls apertures = "", beams = ""
List of apertures and beams to be selected from the input spectra.  The
logical intersection of the two lists is selected.  The null list
selects all apertures or beams.  A list consists of comma separated
numbers and ranges of numbers.  A range is specified by a hyphen.  An
optional step size may be given by 'x' followed by a number.
See \fBxtools.ranges\fR for more information.  If the first character
is "!" then the apertures/beams not in the list are selected.  Note
that a "!" in either of the lists complements the intersection of the
two lists.  For longslit input spectra the aperture numbers
selects the lines or columns to be extracted.  For 3D Fabry-Perot
spectra the aperture numbers select the first spatial axis.
.le
.ls bands = ""
List of bands in 3D multispec.
For 3D spatial spectra the band parameter applies to the second
spatial axis.
The null list selects all bands.  The syntax is as described above.
.le
.ls apmodulus = 0
Modulus to be applied to the input aperture numbers before matching against
the aperture list.  If zero then no modulus is used.  This is allows
selecting apertures which are related by the same modulus, typically a
factor of 10; for example, 10, 1010 and 2010 with a modulus of 1000 are
related.
.le
.ls format = "multispec" (multispec|onedspec)
Output image format and name syntax.  The "multispec" format consists of
one or more spectra in the same image file.  The "onedspec" format consists
of a single spectrum per image with names having a root name and a four
digit aperture number extension.  Note that converting to "onedspec" format
from three dimensional images where the third dimension contains associated
spectra will not include data from the extra dimension.  Image sections may
be used in that case.
.le
.ls renumber = no
Renumber the output aperture numbers?  If set the output aperture
numbers, including any preexisting spectra when merging, are renumbered
beginning with 1.  The \fIoffset\fR parameter may be used to
change the starting number.
.le
.ls offset = 0
Offset to be added to the input or renumbered aperture number to form
the final output aperture number.
.le
.ls clobber = no
Modify an existing output image either by overwriting or merging?
.le
.ls merge = no
Merge apertures into existing spectra?  This
requires that the \fIclobber\fR parameter be set.  If not merging
then the selected spectra entirely replace those in existing output images.
If merging then the input spectra replace those in the output image
with the same aperture number and new apertures are added if not present.
.le
.ls rebin = yes
Rebin the spectrum to the exact wavelength range specified by the \fIw1\fR
and \fIw2\fR parameters?  If the range is given as INDEF for both endpoints
this parameter does not apply.  If a range is given and this parameter is
not set then the pixels in the specified range (using the nearest pixels to
the endpoint wavelengths) are copied without rebinning.  In this case the
wavelength of the first pixel may not be exactly that specified by \fIw1\fR
and the dispersion, including non-linear dispersions, is unchanged.  If
this parameter is set the spectra are interpolated to have the first and
last pixels at exactly the specified endpoint wavelengths while preserving
the same number of pixels in the interval.  Linear and log-linear
dispersion types are maintained while non-linear dispersions are
linearized.
.le
.ls verbose = no
Print a record of each aperture copied?
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
\fBScopy\fR selects regions of spectra from an input list of spectral
images and copies them to output images.  This task can be used to extract
aperture spectra from long slit and Fabry-Perot images and to select,
reorganize, merge, renumber, pack, and unpack spectra in many ways.  Below
is a list of some of the uses and many examples are given in the EXAMPLES
section.

.nf
   o Pack many spectra into individual images into a single image
   o Unpack images with multiple spectra into separate images
   o Extract a set of lines or columns from long slit spectra
   o Extract a set of spatial positions from Fabry-Perot spectra
   o Extract specific wavelength regions
   o Select a subset of spectra to create a new image
   o Merge a subset of spectra into an existing image
   o Combine spectra from different images into one image
   o Renumber apertures
.fi

Input spectra are specified by an image list which may include explicit
image names, wildcard templates and @files containing image names.
The image names may also include image sections such as to select portions of
the wavelength coverage.  The input images may be either one or two
dimensional spectra.  One dimensional spectra may be stored in
individual one dimensional images or as lines in two (or three)
dimensional images.  The one dimensional spectra are identified by
an aperture number, which must be unique within an image, and a beam number.
Two dimensional long slit and three dimensional Fabry-Perot spectra are
treated, for the purpose of this
task, as a collection of spectra with dispersion either along any axis
specified by the DISPAXIS image header parameter
or the \fIdispaxis\fR package parameter.  The aperture and band
parameters specify a spatial position.  A number of adjacent
lines, columns, and bands, specified by the \fInsum\fR package parameter,
will be summed to form an aperture spectrum.  If number is odd then the
aperture/band number refers to the middle and if it is even it refers to the
lower of the two middle lines or columns.

In the case of many spectra each stored in separate one dimensional
images, the image names may be such that they have a common root name
and a four digit aperture number extension.  This name syntax is
called "onedspec" format.  Including such spectra in an
input list may be accomplished either with wildcard templates such as

.nf
	name*
	name.????.imh
.fi

where the image type extension ".imh" must be given to complete the
template but the actual extension could also be that for an STF type
image, or using an @file prepared with the task \fBnames\fR.
To generate this syntax for output images the \fIformat\fR parameter
is set to "onedspec" (this will be discussed further later).

From the input images one may select a range of wavelengths with the
\fIw1\fR and \fIw2\fR parameters and a subset of spectra based on aperture and
beam numbers using the \fIaperture\fR and \fIbeam\fR parameters.
If the wavelength range is specified as INDEF the full spectra are
copied without any resampling.  If the aperture and beam lists are not
specified, an empty list, then all apertures and beams are selected.  The
lists may be those spectra desired or the complement obtained by prefixing
the list with '!'.  Only the selected wavelength range and spectra will
be operated upon and passed on to the output images.

Specifying a wavelength range is fairly obvious except for the question
of pixel sampling.  Either the pixels in the specified range are copied
without resampling or the pixels are resampled to correspond eactly
to the requested range.  The choice is made with the \fIrebin\fR parameter.
In the first case the nearest pixels to the specified wavelength
endpoints are determined and those pixels and all those in between
are copied.  The dispersion relation is unchanged.  In the second case
the spectra are reinterpolated to have the specified starting and
ending wavelengths with the same number of pixels between those points
as in the original spectrum.  The reinterpolation is done in either
linear or log-linear dispersion.  The non-linear dispersion functions
are interpolated to a linear dispersion.

Using \fBscopy\fR with long slit or Fabry-Perot images provides a quick and
simple type of extraction as opposed to using the \fBapextract\fR package.
When summing it is often desired to start each aperture after the number of
lines summed.  To do this specify a step size in the aperture/band list.  For
example to extract columns 3 to 23 summing every 5 columns you would use an
aperture list of "3-23x5" and an \fInsum\fR of 5.  If you do not use the
step in the aperture list you would extract the sum of columns 1 to 5, then
columns 2 to 6, and so on.

In the special case of subapertures extracted by \fBapextract\fR, related
apertures are numbered using a modulus; for example apertures
5, 1005, 2005.  To allow selecting all related apertures using a single
aperture number the \fIapmodulus\fR parameter is used to specify the
modulus factor; 1000 in the above example.  This is a very specialized
feature which should be ignored by most users.

The output list of images may consist of an empty list, a single image,
or a list of images matching the input list in number.  Note that it
is the number of image names that matters and not the number of spectra
since there may be any number of spectra in an image.  The empty list
converts to the same list as the input and is shorthand for replacing
the input image with the output image upon completion; therefore it
is equivalent to the case of a matching list.  If the input
consists of just one image then the distinction between a single
output and a matching list is moot.  The interesting distinction is
when there is an input list of two or more images.  The two cases
are then a mapping of many-to-many or many-to-one.  Note that it is
possible to have more complex mappings by repeating the same output
name in a matching list provided clobbering, merging, and possibly
renumbering is enabled.

In the case of a matching list, spectra from different input images
will go to different output images.  In the case of a single output
image all spectra will go to the same output image.  Note that in
this discussion an output image when "onedspec" format is specified
is actually a root name for possibly many images.  However,
it should be thought of as a single image from the point of view
of image lists.

When mapping many spectra to a single output image, which may have existing
spectra if merging, there may be a conflict with repeated aperture
numbers.  One option is to consecutively renumber the aperture numbers,
including any previous spectra in the output image when merging and then
continuing with the input spectra in the order in which they are selected.
This is specified with the \fIrenumber\fR parameter which renumbers
beginning with 1.

Another options which may be used independently of renumbering or in
conjunction with it is to add an offset as specified by the \fIoffset\fR
parameter.  This is last step in determining the output aperture
numbers so that if used with the renumber option the final aperture
numbers begin with one plus the offset.

It has been mentioned that it is possible to write and add to
existing images.  If an output image exists an error will be
printed unless the \fIclobber\fR parameter is set.  If clobbering
is allowed then the existing output image will be replaced by the
new output.  Rather than replacing an output image sometimes one
wants to replace certain spectra or add new spectra.  This is
done by selecting the \fImerge\fR option.  In this case if the output
has a spectrum with the same aperture number as the input spectrum
it is replaced by the input spectrum.  If the input spectrum aperture
number is not in the output then the spectrum is added to the output
image.  To add spectra with the same aperture number and not
replace the one in the output use the \fIrenumber\fR or
\fIoffset\fR options.

To print a record as each input spectrum is copied the \fIverbose\fR
parameter may be set.  The syntax is the input image name followed
by the aperture number in [].  An arrow then points to the output
image name with the final aperture number also in [], except for
"onedspec" format where the image name extension gives the aperture
number.  It is important to remember that it is the aperture numbers
which are shown and not the image lines; there is not necessarily any
relation between image lines and aperture numbers though often they
are the same.

EXAMPLES
Because there are so many possiblities there are many examples.  To
help find examples close to those of interest they are divided into
three sections; examples involving standard multispec images only, examples
with onedspec format images, and examples with long slit and Fabry-Perot
images.  In the examples the verbose flag is set to yes and the output is
shown.

I.   MULTISPEC IMAGES

The examples in this section deal with the default spectral format of
one or more spectra in an image.  Note that the difference between
a "onedspec" image and a "multispec" image with one spectrum is purely
the image naming syntax.

1.  Select a single spectrum (aperture 3):

.nf
	cl> scopy example1 ap3 aperture=3
	example1[3]  -->  ap3[3]
.fi

2.  Select a wavelength region from a single spectrum:

.nf
	cl> scopy example1 ap3 aperture=3 w1=5500 w2=6500
	example1[3]  -->  ap3[3]
.fi

3.  Select a subset of spectra (apertures 1, 2, 4, 6, and 9): 

.nf
	cl> scopy example1 subset apertures="1-2,4,6-9x3"
	example1[1]  -->  subset[1]
	example1[2]  -->  subset[2]
	example1[4]  -->  subset[4]
	example1[6]  -->  subset[6]
	example1[9]  -->  subset[9]
.fi

This example shows various features of the aperture list syntax.

4.  Select the same apertures (1 and 3) from multiple spectra and in the
same wavelength region:

.nf
	cl> scopy example* %example%subset%* apertures=1,3 w1=5500 w2=6500
	example1[1]  -->  subset1[1]
	example1[3]  -->  subset1[3]
	example2[1]  -->  subset2[1]
	example2[3]  -->  subset2[3]
	...
.fi

The output list uses the pattern substitution feature of image templates.

5.  Select the same aperture from multiple spectra and pack them in a
a single image:

.nf
	cl> scopy example* ap2 aperture=2 renumber+
	example1[2]  -->  ap2[1]
	example2[2]  -->  ap2[2]
	example3[2]  -->  ap2[3]
	...
.fi

6.  To renumber the apertures sequentially starting with 11:

.nf
	cl> scopy example1 renum renumber+
	example1[1]  -->  renum[11]
	example1[5]  -->  renum[12]
	example1[9]  -->  renum[13]
	...
.fi

7.  To replace apertures (2) in one image with that from another:

.nf
	cl> scopy example1 example2 aperture=2 clobber+ merge+
	example1[2]  --> example2[2]
.fi

8.  To merge two sets of spectra with different aperture numbers into
    one image:

.nf
	cl> scopy example![12]* merge
	example1[1]  ->  merge[1]
	example1[3]  ->  merge[3]
	...
	example2[2]  ->  merge[2]
	example2[4]  ->  merge[4]
	...
.fi

The input list uses the ![] character substitution syntax of image templates.

9.  To merge a set of spectra with the same aperture numbers into another
existing image:

.nf
	cl> scopy example2 example1 clobber+ merge+ renumber+
	example1[5]  -->  example1[2]
	example1[9]  -->  example1[3]
	example2[1]  -->  example1[4]
	example2[5]  -->  example1[5]
	example2[9]  -->  example1[6]
.fi

Both images contained apertures 1, 5, and 9.  The listing does not show
the renumbering of the aperture 1 from example1 since the aperture number
was not changed.

10.  Select parts of a 3D image where the first band is the
variance weighted extraction, band 2 is nonweighted extraction,
band 3 is the sky, and band 4 is the sigma:

.nf
	cl> scopy example3d.ms[*,*,1] var1.ms
	example3d.ms[*,*,1][1]  -->  var1.ms[1]
	example3d.ms[*,*,1][2]  -->  var1.ms[2]
	...
	cl> scopy example3d.ms[10:400,3,3] skyap3
	example3d.ms[10:400,3,3][3]  -->  skyap3[3]
	cl> scopy example3d.ms[*,*,1] "" clobber+
	example3d.ms[*,*,1][1]  -->  example3d.ms[1]
	example3d.ms[*,*,1][2]  -->  example3d.ms[2]
	...
.fi

Note that this could also be done with \fBimcopy\fR.  The last example
is done in place; i.e. replacing the input image by the output image
with the other bands eliminatated; i.e. the output image is two dimensional.

II.  ONEDSPEC IMAGES

1.  Expand a multi-spectrum image to individual single spectrum images:

.nf
	cl> scopy example1 record format=onedspec
	example1[1]  -->  record.0001
	example1[5]  -->  record.0005
	example1[9]  -->  record.0009
	...
.fi

2.  Pack a set of individual 1D spectra into a single image:

.nf
	cl> scopy record.????.imh record.ms
	record.0001[1]  -->  record.ms[1]
	record.0005[5]  -->  record.ms[5]
	record.0009[9]  -->  record.ms[9]
	...
.fi

3.  Copy a set of record syntax spectra to a different rootname and renumber:

.nf
	cl> scopy record.????.imh newroot format=onedspec
	record.0001[1]  -->  newroot.0001
	record.0005[5]  -->  newroot.0002
	record.0009[9]  -->  newroot.0003
	...
.fi

III. LONG SLIT IMAGES

To define the dispersion axis either the image header parameter DISPAXIS
must be set (using HEDIT for example) or a the package \fIdispaxis\fR
parameter must be set.  In these examples the output is the default
multispec format.

1.  To extract column 250 into a spectrum:

.nf
	cl> scopy longslit1 c250 aperture=250
	longslit1[250]  -->  c250[250]
.fi

2.  To sum and extract every set of 10 columns:

.nf
	cl> nsum = 10  (or epar the package parameters)
	cl> scopy longslit1 sum10 apertures=5-500x10
	longslit1[5]  -->  sum10[5]
	longslit1[15]  -->  sum10[15]
	longslit1[25]  -->  sum10[25]
	...
.fi

3.  To extract the sum of 10 columns centered on column 250 from a set
of 2D images:

.nf
	cl> nsum = 10  (or epar the package parameters)
	cl> scopy longslit* %longslit%c250.%* aperture=250
	longslit1[250]  -->  c250.1[250]
	longslit2[250]  -->  c250.2[250]
	longslit3[250]  -->  c250.3[250]
	...
.fi

4.  To extract the sum of 10 columns centered on column 250 from a set of
2D images and merge them into a single, renumbered output image:

.nf
	cl> nsum = 10  (or epar the package parameters)
	cl> scopy longslit* c250 aperture=250 renum+
	longslit1[250]  -->  c250[1]
	longslit2[250]  -->  c250[2]
	longslit3[250]  -->  c250[3]
	...
.fi

IV. FABRY-PEROT IMAGES

To define the dispersion axis either the image header parameter DISPAXIS
must be set (using HEDIT for example) or a the package \fIdispaxis\fR
parameter must be set.  In these examples the output is the default
multispec format.

1.  To extract a spectrum from the spatial position (250,250) where
dispaxis=3:

.nf
	cl> scopy fp1 a250 aperture=250 band=250
	longslit1[250]  -->  a250[250]
.fi

2.  To sum and extract every set of 10 lines and bands (dispaxis=1):

.nf
	cl> nsum = "10"
	cl> scopy fp1 sum10 apertures=5-500x10 bands=5-500x10
	longslit1[5]  -->  sum10[5]
	longslit1[15]  -->  sum10[15]
	longslit1[25]  -->  sum10[25]
	...
.fi

3.  To extract the sum of 10 columns and 20 lines centered on column 250 and
line 100 from a set of 3D images with dispaxis=3:

.nf
	cl> nsum = "10 20"
	cl> scopy longslit* %longslit%c250.%* aperture=250 band=100
	longslit1[250]  -->  c250.1[250]
	longslit2[250]  -->  c250.2[250]
	longslit3[250]  -->  c250.3[250]
	...
.fi

.ih
REVISIONS
.ls SCOPY V2.11
Previously both w1 and w2 had to be specified to select a range to
copy.  Now if only one is specified the second endpoint defaults
to the first or last pixel.
.le
.ls SCOPY V2.10.3
Additional support for 3D multispec/equispec or spatial spectra has been
added.  The "bands" parameter allows selecting specific bands and
the onedspec output format creates separate images for each selected
aperture and band.
.le
.ls SCOPY V2.10
This task is new.
