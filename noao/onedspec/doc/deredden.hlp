NAME
deredden -- Apply interstellar reddening correction
.ih
USAGE
deredden input output [records] value
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
List of input spectra to be dereddened.  When using record
format extensions the root names are specified, otherwise full
image names are used.
.le
.ls output
List of derreddened spectra.  If no output list is specified then
the input spectra are modified.  Also the output name may be
the same as the input name to replace the input spectra by the
calibrated spectra.  When using record format extensions the
output names consist of root names to which the appropriate
record number extension is added.  The record number extension
will be the same as the input record number extension.
.le
.ls records (imred.irs and imred.iids only)
The set of record number extensions to be applied to each input
and output root name when using record number extension 
format.  The syntax consists of comma separated numbers or
ranges of numbers.  A range consists of two numbers separated
by a hyphen.  This parameter is not queried when record number
formats are not used.
.le
.ls value
Extinction parameter value as selected by the type parameter.
This value may be a visual extinction, A(V), the color excess between
B and V, E(B-V), or the logarithmic H beta extinction.
These quantities are discussed further below.
.le
.ls R = 3.1
The ratio of extinction at V, A(V), to color excess between B and V, E(B-V).
.le
.ls type = "E(B-V)"
The type of extinction parameter used.  The values may be:
.ls A(V)
The absolute extinction at the V band at 5550 Angstroms.
.le       
.ls E(B-V)
The color excess between the B and V bands.
.le
.ls c     
The logarithmic H beta extinction.
.le
.le
.ls apertures = ""
List of apertures to be selected from input one dimensional spectra
to be calibrated.  If no list is specified then all apertures are
corrected.  The syntax is the same as the record number
extensions.  This parameter is ignored for N-dimensional spatial
spectra such as calibrated long slit and Fabry-Perot data.
.le
.ls override = no, uncorrect = yes
If a spectrum has been previously corrected it will contain the header
parameter DEREDDEN.  If this parameter is present and the override
parameter is no then a warning will be issued and no further correction
will be applied.  The override parameter permits overriding this check.  If
overriding a previous correction the \fIuncorrect\fR parameter determines
whether the spectra are first uncorrected to the original values before
applying the new correction.  If \fIuncorrect\fR is yes then the image
header DEREDDEN parameter will refer to a correction from the original data
while if it is no then the new correction is differential and the keyword
will only reflect the last correction.  When correcting individual spectra
separately in a multispectra image with different extinction parameters the
uncorrect parameter should be no.

DESCRIPTION
The input spectra are corrected for interstellar extinction, or
reddening, using the empirical selective extinction function of
Cardelli, Clayton, and Mathis, \fBApJ 345:245\fR, 1989, (CCM).
The function is defined over the range 0.3-10 inverse microns
or 100-3333 nanometers.  If the input data extend outside this
range an error message will be produced.

The extinction function requires two parameters, the absolute extinction at
5550A, A(V), and the ratio, R(V), of this extinction to the color excess
between 4350A and 5550A, E(B-V).

One of the input task parameters is R(V).  If it is not known one
may use the default value of 3.1 typical of the average 
interstellar extinction.  The second input parameter is chosen by
the parameter \fItype\fR which may take the values "A(V)", "E(B-V)", or
"c".  The value of the parameter is specified by the parameter
\fIvalue\fR.

If A(V) is used then the CCM function can be directly evaluated.  If
E(B-V) is used then A(V) is derived by:

.nf
(1)     A(V) = R(V) * E(B-V)
.fi

For planetary nebula studies the logarithmic extinction at H beta,
denoted as c, is often determined instead of E(B-V).  If this type
of input is chosen then A(V) is derived by:

.nf
(2)     A(V) = R(V) * c * (0.61 + 0.024 * c).
.fi

This relation is based on the relation betwen E(B-V) and c computed
by Kaler and Lutz, \fBPASP 97:700\fR, 1985 to include corrections between
the monochromatic parameter c and the broadband parameter E(B-V).
In particular the function is a least squares fit to the values of
c and E(B-V) in Table III of the form:

.nf
(3)     E(B-V) = c * (A + B * c)
.fi

The input spectra are specified by a list of root names (when using record
extension format) or full image names.  They are required to be dispersion
corrected (DC-FLAG >= 0) and not previously corrected (DEREDDEN absent).
Spectra not satisfying these requirements are skipped with a warning.  The
DEREDDEN flag may be overridden with the \fIoverride\fR parameter.  This
may be done if different extinction parameters are required for different
spectra in the same multiple spectrum image or if a new correction is
to be applied.  The \fIuncorrect\fR parameter determines whether the
previous correction is removed so that the final correction is relative
to the original data or if the new correction is differential on the
previous correction.  Note that if applying separate corrections to
different spectra in a single multispectral image then override should
be yes and uncorrect should be no.

A subset of apertures to be corrected may be selected from one dimensional
spectra with the \fIapertures\fR parameter.  Long slit or other higher
dimensional spatially sampled spectra are treated as a unit.  The output
calibrated spectra may replace the input spectra if no output spectra list
is specified or if the output name is the same as the input name.  When
using record number extensions the output spectra will have the same
extensions applied to the root names as those used for the input spectra.

Note that by specifying a negative extinction parameter this task may
be used to add interstellar extinction.

EXAMPLES
1.  To deredden a spectrum with an extinction of 1.2 magnitudes at V:
    
.nf
	cl> deredden obj1.ms drobj1.ms 1.2 type=A
.fi

2.  To deredden a spectrum in place with a color excess of 0.65 and
and R(V) value of 4.5:

.nf
	cl> deredden obj2.ms obj2.ms R=4.5
	E(B-V): .65
.fi

3.  To deredden a series of IRS planetary nebula spectra using the
H beta extinction in the irs package:

.nf
	cl> deredden pn12 drpn12 1-5,12-14 type=c
	c: 1.05
.fi

4.  To redden a spectrum:

.nf
	cl> deredden artspec artspec -1.2 type=A
.fi

5. To deredden a long slit or Fabry-Perot spectrum either DISPAXIS
must be in the image header or be specified in the package parameters.
The summing parameters are ignored.
    
.nf
	cl> deredden obj1 drobj1 1.2 type=A
.fi

REVISIONS
.ls DEREDDEN V2.10.3
Extended to operate on two and three dimensional spatial spectra such as
calibrated long slit and Fabry-Perot data.

An option was added to allow a previous correction to be undone in order
to keep the DEREDDEN information accurate relative to the original
data.
.le
.ls DEREDDEN V2.10
This task is new.
.le
.ih
NOTES
Since there can be only one deredding flag in multispectral images
one needs to override the flag if different spectra require different
corrections and then only the last correction will be recorded.
