DESCRIPTION
Features in the input images are identified interactively and assigned
user coordinates.  A "coordinate function" mapping pixel coordinates to
user coordinates may be determined from the identified features.  A
user coordinate list is used to automatically identify additional
features.  This task is used to measure positions of features,
determine dispersion solutions for spectra, and to identify features in
two dimensional images to be used to map a two dimensional coordinate
transformation.

Each image in the input list is considered in turn.  If the image is
not one dimensional or a one dimensional section of an image then an
image section is appended to the image name.  The image section is set
by the parameter \fIsection\fR which may be specified in several ways
as described in the parameter section.  If the image is not one
dimensional then the number of lines or columns given by the parameter
\fInsum\fR are summed.  The one dimensional image vector is graphed on
the standard graphics device (stdgraph).  The initial feature list and
coordinate function are read from the database if an entry exist.  The
features are marked on the graph.  The image coordinates are in pixels
unless a coordinate function is defined, in which case they are in user
coordinate units.  The pixel coordinate, coordinate function value, and
user coordinate for the current feature are printed.

The graphics cursor is used to select features and perform various
functions.  A menu of the keystroke options and functions is printed
with the key '?'.  The cursor keys and their functions are defined in
the CURSOR KEYS section and described further below.  The standard
cursor mode keys are also available to window and redraw the graph and
to produce hardcopy "snaps".

There are two types of feature selection functions;  defining new
features and selecting previously defined features.  The key 'm' marks
a new feature nearest the cursor position.  The feature position is
determined by the feature centering algorithm (see help for
\fBcenter1d\fR).  If the new position is within a distance given by the
parameter \fIminsep\fR of a previous feature it is considered to be the
same feature and replaces the old feature.  Normally the position of
the new feature will be exactly the same as the original feature.  The
coordinate list is searched for a match between the coordinate function
value (when defined) and a user coordinate in the list.  If a match is
found it becomes the default user coordinate which the user may
override.  The new feature is marked on the graph and it becomes the
current feature.  The redefinition of a feature which is within the
minimum separation may be used to set the user coordinate from the
coordinate list.  The key 't' allows setting the position of a feature
to other than that found by the centering algorithm.

The 'y' key applies a peak finding algorithm to the one dimensional image
vector.  Up to the maximum number of features (\fImaxfeatures\fR) are
found.  If there are more peaks only the strongest are kept.  The peaks
are then matched against the coordinate list to find user coordinate values.

To select a different feature as the current feature the keys '.', 'n', '+',
and '-' are used.  The '.' selects the feature nearest the cursor, the
'n' and '+' select the next feature, and the '-' selects the previous
feature relative to the current feature in the feature list as ordered
by pixel coordinate.  These keys are useful when redefining the user
coordinate with the 'u' key and when examining features in zoom mode.

If two or more features are identified spanning the range of the
data or if a coordinate function is defined then the 'l' key may be
used to identify additional features from a coordinate list.  If a
coordinate function is not defined the default function is fit to the
user coordinates of the currently defined features.  Then for each
coordinate value in the coordinate list the pixel coordinate is determined
and a search for a feature at that point is made.  If a feature is found
(based on the parameters \fIftype, fwidth\fR, \fIcradius\fR, and 
\fBthreshold\fR) its
user coordinate value based on the coordinate function is determined.
If the coordinate function value matches the user coordinate from the
coordinate list within the error limit set by the parameter \fImatch\fR
then the new feature is entered in the feature list.  Up to a maximum
number of features, set by the parameter \fImaxfeatures\fR, may be defined
in this way.  A new user coordinate function is fit to all the located
features.  Finally, the graph is redrawn in user coordinates with
the additional features found from the coordinate list marked.

A minimum of two features must be defined for this algorithm to work.
However, three or more features are preferable to determine changes
in the dispersion as a function of position.

The key 'f' fits a function of the pixel coordinates to the user
coordinates.  The type of function, order and other fitting parameters
are initially set with the parameters \fIfunction, order, sample,
niterate, low_reject, high_reject\fR and \fIgrow\fR..  The value of the
function for a particular pixel coordinate is called the function
coordinate and each feature in the feature list has a function
coordinate value.  The fitted function also is used to convert pixel
coordinates to user coordinates in the graph.  The fitting is done
within the interactive curve fitting package which has its own set of
interactive commands.  For further information on this package see the
help material under \fBicfit\fR.

If a zero point shift is desired without changing the coordinate function
the user may specify the coordinate of a point in the spectrum with
the 's' key from which a shift is determined.  The 'g' key also
determines a shift by minimizing the difference between the user
coordinates and the fitted coordinates.  This is used when a previously
determined coordinate function is applied to a new spectrum having
fewer or poorer lines and only a zero point shift can reasonably be
determined.  Note that the zero point shift is in user coordinates.
This is only an approximate correction for shifts in the raw spectra
since these shifts are in pixels and the coordinate function should
also be appropriately shifted.

Features may be delete with the key 'd'.  All features are deleted
when the 'a' key immediately precedes the delete key.  Deleting the
features does not delete the coordinate function.  Features deleted in the
curve fitting package also are removed from the feature list upon
exitting the curve fitting package.

It is common to transfer the feature identifications and coordinate function
from one image to another.  When a new image without a database entry
is examined, such as when going to the next image in the input list or selecting
a new image with the ":image" command, the current feature list and coordinate
function are kept.  Alternatively, a database record from a different
image may be read with the ":read" command.  When transfering feature
identifications between images the feature coordinates will not agree exactly
with the new image feature positions and several options are available to
reregister the feature positions.  The key 'c' centers the feature nearest
the cursor using the current position as the starting point.  When preceded
with the 'a' key all the features are recentered (the user must refit
the coordinate function if desired).  As an aside, the recentering
function is also useful when the parameters governing the feature
centering algorithm are changed.

The (c)entering function is applicable when the shift between the
current and true feature positions is small.  Larger shifts may be
determined automatically with the 'x' function which correlates
features in the image with the feature list.  The features are then
recentered.  A zero point shift may also be given interactively with
the 's' key by using the cursor to indicate the coordinate of a point
in the spectrum.  If there are no features then the shift is exactly as
marked by the cursor but if there are features the approximate shift is
applied and then the features are recentered.  The shift is then the
mean shift of the features after recentering.  The shift is used as a
zero point offset added to the dispersion function.  The shift is
in user coordinates.

In addition to the single keystroke commands there are commands initiated
by the key ':' (colon commands).  As with the keystroke commands there are
a number of standard graphics features available begining with ":."
(type ":.help" for these commands).  The identify colon commands
allow the task parameter values to be listed and to be reset
within the task.  A parameter is listed by typing its name.  The colon command
":show" lists all the parameters.  A parameter value is reset by
typing the parameter name followed by the new value; for example
":match 10".  Other colon commands display the feature list (:features),
control reading and writing records to the database (:read and :write),
and set the graph display format.

The feature identification process for an image is completed by typing
'q' to quit.  Attempting to quit an image without explicitly
recording changes in the feature database produces a warning message and an
opportunity to record the information in the database.  Also
the reference spectrum keyword REFSPEC is added to the image header at
this time.  This is used by \fBrefspectra\fR and \fBdispcor\fR.
As an immediate exit the 'I' interrupt key may be used.  This does not save
the feature information.

DATABASE RECORDS
The database specified by the parameter \fIdatabase\fR is a directory of
simple text files.  The text files have names beginning with 'id' followed
by the entry name, usually the name of the image.  The database text files
consist of a number of records.  A record begins with a line starting with the
keyword "begin".  The rest of the line is the record identifier.  Records
read and written by \fBecidentify\fR have "identify" as the first word of the
identifier.  Following this is a name which may be specified following the
":read" or ":write" commands.  If no name is specified then the image name
is used.  The lines following the record identifier contain
the feature information and dispersion function coefficients.

EXAMPLES
Because this task is interactive and has many possible applications
it is difficult to provide actual examples.  Instead some uses of the task
are described.

1.  For defining distortions in the slit dimension as a function of
wavelength the positions of objects are marked at some wavelength.
The task \fBreidentify\fR is then used to trace the features to other
wavelengths.

2.  For determining dispersion solutions in a one dimensional
spectrum an arc calibration is used.  Three emission features are marked
and the (l)ocate key is used to find additional features from a
coordinate list of arc lines.  The dispersion solution is fit interactively
and badly determined or misidentified lines are deleted.  The
solution may be written to the database or transfered to the object
spectrum by reading the object image and deleting all the features.
Deleting the features does not delete the coordinate function.

3.  For determining a two dimensional coordinate transformation the
a dispersion solution is determined at one slit position in an arc spectrum
as in the previous example.  The features are then traced to other
slit positions with the task \fBreidentify\fR.

NOTES
