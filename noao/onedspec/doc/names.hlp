NAME
names -- Generate image names from a root and a range descriptor
.ih
USAGE
names input records
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The root file name for the input records to be calibrated.
.le
.ls records
The range of spectra to be included in the calibration operation.
Each range item will be appended to the root name to form an
image file name.
.le
.ls append = ""
If not a null string, this character string will be appended to
all the generated image names. This allows for a specification of
image sections.
.le
.ls check = no
If set to yes, a check is made that each name implied by the range
specification has at least an image header. The pixel file is not
checked. If set to no, then all possible image names are generated
even if no image exists.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
A sequence of image names is generated from the input root file name
and the range description by appending the possible range values to
the root in the form "root.nnnn". At least four digits will follow the
root.

If an append string is specified, this is added to the image name as well.

The generated image names are written to STDOUT, but may be redirected
to a file for further use.
.ih
EXAMPLES
The following will generate names of the form nite1.0001, nite1.0002 ...
nite1.0010 and place the list in the file nite1.lst.

.nf
	cl> names nite1 1-10 >nite1.lst
.fi

The next example uses the append option to specify that only the
first 512 pixels of each image (spectrum) are to used in the image name.

.nf
	cl> names nite1 1-10 append="[1:512]" >nite1.lst
.fi
.ih
REVISIONS
.ls NAMES V2.10
This task is unchanged.

BUGS
The append option is only useful for adding image sections since it is
added after the ONEDSPEC name is generated.  Appending other strings
produces names such as root.0012str which are not recognized by
the package.
