SCOMBINE -- Combine spectra

This routine is based in large part on IMCOMBINE.  The routines in the
generic directory are identical to those in that task except that they
only contain routines for real data.  The ic routines in this directory
are similar though modified from IMCOMBINE.

The iscombine files are for an interactive combine task based on work
by CTIO.  Because it is limited currently to linear spectra and is not
organized to take advantage of the IMCOMBINE options it is not installed.
A version of this may someday be added based on the current software.


=======

This version was renamed to OSCOMBINE.  It is obsolete and may be removed
at some future time.  (4/14/04, Valdes)
