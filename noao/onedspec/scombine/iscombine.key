		SCOMBINE CURSOR KEYS

a - Mark scaling ranges in overlap region for 'v' key
b - Cancel scaling ranges
c - Print cursor position
d - Replace range of pixels by straight cursor line
e - Replace range of pixels by linear interpolation from the endpoint pixels
f - Start over from the first spectrum
j - Fudge a point to vertical cursor value
n - Go on to next spectrum
o - Reset data for current spectrum to initial values
p - Don't include current spectrum in combined image and go on to next spectrum
q - Quit and combine remaining spectra noninteractively (no|yes|YES)
s - Mark accumulation ranges in current spectrum
t - Cancel accumulation ranges
v - Shift overlap average of spectrum vertically to accumulated spectrum
w - Window the graph using gtools commands
x - Shift spectrum horizontally to cursor position
y - Shift spectrum vertically to cursor position
z - Shift spectrum vertically to accumulated spectrum
+ - Set additive scaling for 'v' key
* - Set multiplicative scaling
