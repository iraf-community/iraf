COLON COMMANDS AND ARGUMENTS:

:flux [min] [max]  Limits for flux calibrated graphs (INDEF for autoscale)
:function [type]   Function to be fit to sensitivity data.  The types are:
			chebyshev - Chebyshev polynomial
			legendre  - Legendre polynomial
			spline1   - Linear spline
			spline3   - Cubic spline
:graphs [types]    Graphs to be displayed (up to four).  The types are:
			a - Residual sensitivity vs airmass
			c - Composite residuals and error bars vs wavelength
			e - Extinction (and revised extinction) vs wavelength
			i - Flux calibrated image vs wavelength
			l - Log of flux calibrated image vs wavelength
			r - Residual sensitivity vs wavelength
			s - Sensitivity vs wavelength
:images [images]   Images to flux calibrate and plot (up to four images)
:colors [colors]   Line and mark colors to use for line and included, deleted,
			and added points.  The colors are specified as four
			whitespace separated integers between 1 and 9.
:marks [marks]     Mark types to use for included, deleted, and added points:
			point, box, plus, cross, diamond, hline, vline,
			hebar, vebar, circle
:order [order]     Order of function (polynomial terms or spline pieces)
:skys [images]     Sky images for flux calibration (optional, up to four images)
:stats [file]      Statistics about standard stars and sensitivity fit
:vstats [file]     Verbose statistics about standard stars and sensitivity fit


EXAMPLES:

:func spline3		Select cubic spline function
:g srae			Graph sensitivity, residuals, airmass, and extinction
:g sii			Graph sensitivity and two images
:i n1.0004 n1.0008	Set first two images to graph (the defaults are
			    taken from the standard star list)
:skys n1.0005		Subtract this sky image from first image for calibration
:colors 2		Change only the line color to 2
:colors	2 5 4 3		Change the line and mark colors
:m plus			Change the mark type for included points and don't
			    change the deleted or added point mark type
:stats			Print statistics to terminal
:vstats stdstats	Print verbose statistics to file
