3. IDENTIFY CURSOR KEYS

?  Clear the screen and print menu of options
a  Apply next (c)enter or (d)elete operation to (a)ll features
c  (C)enter the feature nearest the cursor
d  (D)elete the  feature nearest the cursor
f  (F)it a function of pixel coordinate to the user coordinates
g  Fit a zero point shift to the user coordinates
i  (I)nitialize (delete features and coordinate fit)
j  Go to the preceding image line or column in a 2D or multispec image
k  Go to the next image line or column in a 2D or multispec image
l  Match coordinates in the coordinate (l)ist to features in the data
m  (M)ark a new feature near the cursor and enter coordinate and label
n  Move the cursor or zoom to the (n)ext feature (same as +)
o  Go to the specified image line or column in a 2D or multispec image
p  (P)an to user defined window after (z)ooming on a feature
q  (Q)uit and continue with next image (also carriage return)
r  (R)edraw the graph
s  (S)hift the current feature to the position of the cursor
t  Reset the position of a feature without centering
u  Enter a new (u)ser coordinate and label for the current feature
v  Modify weight of line in fitting
w  (W)indow the graph.  Use '?' to window prompt for more help.
x  Crosscorrelate features with the data peaks and reregister
y  Automatically find "maxfeatures" strongest peaks and identify them
z  (Z)oom on the feature nearest the cursor
.  Move the cursor or zoom to the feature nearest the cursor
+  Move the cursor or zoom to the next feature
-  Move the cursor or zoom to the previous feature
I  Interrupt task and exit immediately.  Database information is not saved.


4. IDENTIFY COLON COMMANDS

The parameters are listed or set with the following commands which may be
abbreviated.  To list the value of a parameter type the command alone.

:show file		Show the values of all the parameters
:features file		Write feature list to file (default is STDOUT)

:coordlist file		Coordinate list file
:cradius value		Centering radius in pixels
:threshold value	Detection threshold for feature centering
:database name		Database for recording feature records
:ftype value		Feature type (emission or absorption)
:fwidth value		Feature width in pixels
:image imagename 	Set a new image or show the current image
:labels value		Feature label type (none|index|pixel|coord|user|both)
:match value		Coordinate list matching distance
:maxfeatures value	Maximum number of features automatically found
:minsep value		Minimum separation allowed between features
:read name ap		Read a record from the database
			(name and ap default to the current spectrum)
:write name ap		Write a record to the database
			(name and ap default to the current spectrum)
:add name ap		Add features from the database
			(name and ap default to the current spectrum)
:zwidth value		Zoom width in user units

Labels:
      none - No labels
     index - Sequential numbers in order of increasing pixel position
     pixel - Pixel coordinates
     coord - User coordinates such as wavelength
      user - User labels
      both - Combination of coord and user
