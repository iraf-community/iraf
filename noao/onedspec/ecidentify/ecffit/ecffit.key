The dispersion function fitted is given by a two dimensional function
(either chebyshev or legendre) of the pixel position along the
dispersion of an order (called x) and the order number (called y).  The
order number is determined from the aperture number by an offset and
direction of increasing order number.  The basic order dependence is
separated from the surface function as given below.

	y = offset +/- aperture
	wavelength = f (x, y) / y
