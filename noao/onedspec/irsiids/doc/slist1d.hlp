NAME
slist1d -- List spectral header information
.ih
USAGE
slist1d input records
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The image root name for the spectra to be listed.
.le
.ls records
The record string for the spectra to be listed. The records will be appended
to the root name to form image names of the type "root.xxxx".
.le
.ls long_header = no
If set to yes, then a complete listing of the header elements
is given. If set to no, then a single line per spectrum is given which lists
in the following order: the image name, object or sky spectrum, exposure
time, spectrum length, and image title.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Each spectrum in the list implied by the root name and the record string
is opened and the header is read. The pixel file is not accessed in order
to save time. The header listing is directed to STDOUT and may be
redirected for printing.

A warning message is issued if
a requested image is not found, but otherwise proceeds.
.ih
EXAMPLES
The following example lists 8 spectral headers in long form on the printer:

.nf
	cl> slist1d nite1 1001-1008 | lprint
.fi

The next example lists the same spectral headers but in short form
on the terminal

.nf
	cl> slist1d nite1 1001-1008 long-
.fi
.ih
REVISIONS
.ls SLIST1D V2.10
This task is the same as V2.9 \fBslist\fR and applies only to the older
IRS/IIDS record extension spectra.  In V2.10 \fBslist\fR
has been revised for multiaperture spectra.

BUGS
SLIST1D does not inform the user if the pixel file can or cannot be read.
