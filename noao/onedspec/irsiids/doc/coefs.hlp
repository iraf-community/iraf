NAME
coefs -- Extract dispersion coefs from mtn HeNeAr headers
.ih
USAGE
coefs input records database
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The input image root name for the spectral images containing the
dispersion coefficients.
.le
.ls records
The range of records for which the root name applies.
.le
.ls database
The database file name which will contain the coefficients.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
The spectra specified by the combination of the root name
and the records are scanned for the presence of dispersion
coefficients. If present, the coefficients and necessary
information are written to the file indicated by the database
parameter. This file an then be used by the linearization
program DISPCOR to correct any spectra for which the
database is appropriate.

Each invocation of COEFS appends to the database file, or
creates a new file if necessary.

The following assumptions are made concerning the coefficients,
which are always correct for IIDS and IRS mountain reduced
data at Kitt Peak.
.ls  5 (1)
The coefficients represent Legendre polynomials.
.le
.ls (2)
The coefficients apply to pixels 1 through 1024 in the original data.
.le
.ih
EXAMPLES
The following example reads the coefficients from the headers
for nite1 arc spectra taken near the beginning and end of the
night and creates a database file called nite1.db:

.nf
	cl> coefs nite1 3-4,201-202 nite1.db
.fi

.ih
TIME REQUIREMENTS
Approximately 1 second per spectrum is required. This is primarily
overhead due to file access.
