NAME
addsets - Add subsets of a string of spectra
.ih
USAGE
addsets input records
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The root file name for the input spectra in the string.
.le
.ls records
The range of spectra indicating the elements of the string.
The names of the spectra will be formed by appending the range
elements to the input root name.
.le
.ls output
This is the root file name for the names of the spectra which will
be created by the addset operation.
.le
.ls start_rec = 1
The starting record number to be appended to the root name of the
created spectra.
.le
.ls subset = 2
The length of the substring of spectra which will be added together.
For IIDS/IRS data which has been processed through BSWITCH, this
parameter should be 2. This implies that spectra will be taken 
2 at a time, added, and the sum written as a new spectrum.
.le
.ls weighting = yes
If set to yes, an average of the substring of spectra is generated
(if flux calibrated) weighted by the integration times of the
individual spectra. If set to no, a simple average is generated.
If not flux calibrated, this parameter has no effect - a simple
sum is generated.
.le
.ih
DESCRIPTION
Every "subset" group of spectra will be accumulated and the sum will be
written as a new spectrum. For example, if the input string contains
100 spectra, and subset=2, then 50 new spectra will be created. Each
new spectrum will be the sum of the consecutive pairs in the original string.

If there are insufficient spectra to complete a subset accumulation,
the sum is written out anyway and a warning printed. For example,
if the input string contains 23 spectra, and subset=4, there will be
6 new spectra created, but the last one will be based on only 3 spectra.

Subset may be set to 1 to allow a copy operation although this is not
a very efficient way to do so.

EXAMPLES
The following three examples are those described above.

.nf
	cl> addsets nite1 2001-2100
	cl> addsets nite1 2001-2023 subset=4
	cl> addsets nite1 2001-2010 subset=1 output=nite2 \
	>>> start_rec=2001
