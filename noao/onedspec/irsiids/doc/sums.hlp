NAME
sums -- Generate sums of the sky and object spectra for each aperture
.ih
USAGE
sums input records
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The root file name for the input spectra in the string.
.le
.ls records
The range of spectra indicating the elements of the string.
The names of the spectra will be formed by appending the range
elements to the input root name.
.le
.ls output
This is the root file name for the names of the spectra which will
be created by the summation operation.
.le
.ls start_rec
The starting record number to be appended to the root name of the
created spectra.
.le

DESCRIPTION
All the object spectra for each aperture are summed, and the
sky spectra are also summed to produce two new spectra for
each observing aperture. Exposure times are accumulated.
No tests are made to check whether the object is consistent
among the specified spectra. This could be accomplished by
checking the titles or telescope positions, but it isn't.

The header parameters OFLAG and BEAM-NUM must be properly
set in the headers.

EXAMPLES
The following example forms 4 new spectra from nite1.2001-nite1.2002,
nite1.2003-nite1.2004, ... assuming this string is derived from
IIDS spectra.
