The number of instrument apertures for this data set.

DESCRIPTION
The input spectra are corrected for atmospheric extinction. 
EXTINCT redirects the spectra through the task BSWITCH so all
procedures are identical to those described for that task.

Because BSWITCH attempts to perform a beam-switch operation
unless the subset parameter is equal to the number of
instrument apertures (in which case beam-switching degenerates
to a copy operation), the hidden parameter nr_aps should be set
appropriately to the instrument. For IIDS and IRS data, this
is 2.

BUGS
The input string of spectra must be ordered so that only
one spectrum from each aperture is present among substrings
of length nr_aps.
