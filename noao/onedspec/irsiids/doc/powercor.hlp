NAME
powercor -- Apply power law correction to mountain reduced spectra
.ih
USAGE
powercor input records
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
The root file name of the input spectra.
.le
.ls records
The range of spectra.
The names of the spectra will be formed by appending the range
elements to the input root name.
.le
.ls output
This is the root file name for the corrected spectra.
.le
.ls start_rec = 1
The starting record number to be appended to the root name of the
created spectra.
.le
.ls power = )iids.power
The power law coefficient.
.le

DESCRIPTION
A power law correction to the IIDS count rates is applied to the input
spectra.  The mountain reduction software applies a coincidence correction
to the observed IIDS count rates but does not correct for a nonlinear effect
in the image tube chain.  This second correction takes the form of a
power law

	C(out) = C(in) ** power

where C(in) is the input, coincidence corrected, count rate and C(out)
is the corrected count rate.  The power is a parameter of the task
which defaults to the \fBiids\fR package parameter set to the appropriate
value for the IIDS.  The exposure time, in seconds, is a required
image header parameter (keyword = EXPOSURE) used to convert the
total counts to count rates.

Note that if the original raw spectra are being reduced then the either
\fBcoincor\fR or \fBpowercor\fR may be used to apply both the coincidence
correction and the power law correction at the same time.  In other words,
the tasks apply the coincidence correction if the coincidence flag (CO-FLAG) is
-1 (uncorrected) and the power law correction alone if the flag is zero
(coincidence corrected only).  The flag is 1 when both the coincidence and
nonlinear correction have been applied.

This task is a script calling \fBcoincor\fR with \fIccmode\fR = "iids".
