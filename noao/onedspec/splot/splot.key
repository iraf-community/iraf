(*) For 'h' key: Measure equivalent widths
    a - Left side for width at 1/2 flux   l - Left side for continuum = 1
    b - Right side for width at 1/2 flux  r - Right side for continuum = 1
    c - Both sides for width at 1/2 flux  k - Both sides for continuum = 1

(*) For 'k' key: Second key may be used to select profile type
    g - Gaussian, l - Lorentzian, v - Voigt, all others - Gaussiank

(*) For 't' key: Fit the continuum with ICFIT and apply to spectrum
    / = normalize by the continuum fit
    - = subtract the continuum fit (residuals)
    f = replace spectrum by the continuum fit
    c = clean spectrum of rejected points
    n = do the fitting but leave the spectrum unchanged
    q = quit without fitting or modifying spectrum

(*) For 'u' key: Adjust the coordinate scale by marking features
    d = apply doppler correction to bring marked feature to specified coord.
    l = set linear (in wavelength) coordinates based on two marked features
    z = apply zero point shift to bring marked feature to
	specified coordinate

The colon commands do not allow abbreviations.

    The label must be quoted if it contains blanks.  A label beginning
    with % (i.e. %.2f) is treated as a format for the x cursor position.
    The optional format is a gtext string (see help on "cursors").
    The labels are not remembered between redraws.

				UNITS

The units are specified by strings having a unit type from the list below
along with the possible preceding modifiers, "inverse", to select the
inverse of the unit and "log" to select logarithmic units. For example "log
angstroms" to plot the logarithm of wavelength in Angstroms and "inv
microns" to plot inverse microns.  The various identifiers may be
abbreviated as words but the syntax is not sophisticated enough to
recognized standard scientific abbreviations except as noted below.

	   angstroms - Wavelength in Angstroms
	  nanometers - Wavelength in nanometers
	millimicrons - Wavelength in millimicrons
	     microns - Wavelength in microns
	 millimeters - Wavelength in millimeters
	  centimeter - Wavelength in centimeters
	      meters - Wavelength in meters
	       hertz - Frequency in hertz (cycles per second)
	   kilohertz - Frequency in kilohertz
	   megahertz - Frequency in megahertz
	    gigahertz - Frequency in gigahertz
	         m/s - Velocity in meters per second
	        km/s - Velocity in kilometers per second
	          ev - Energy in electron volts
	         kev - Energy in kilo electron volts
	         mev - Energy in mega electron volts
		   z - Redshift

	          nm - Wavelength in nanometers
	          mm - Wavelength in millimeters
	          cm - Wavelength in centimeters
	           m - Wavelength in meters
	          Hz - Frequency in hertz (cycles per second)
	         KHz - Frequency in kilohertz
	         MHz - Frequency in megahertz
	         GHz - Frequency in gigahertz
		  wn - Wave number (inverse centimeters)

The velocity and redshift units require a trailing value and unit defining the
velocity zero point.  For example to plot velocity relative to
a wavelength of 1 micron the unit string would be:

	km/s 1 micron
