For 't' key: Fit the continuum with ICFIT and apply to spectrum
    / = normalize by the continuum fit
    - = subtract the continuum fit (residuals)
    f = replace spectrum by the continuum fit
    c = clean spectrum of rejected points
    n = do the fitting but leave the spectrum unchanged
    q = quit without fitting or modifying spectrum

For 'u' key: Adjust the coordinate scale by marking features
    d = apply doppler correction to bring marked feature to
	specified coordinate
    l = set linear (in wavelength) coordinates based on two marked features
    z = apply zero point shift to bring marked feature to
	specified coordinate

				UNITS

The units are specified by strings having a unit type from the list below
along with the possible preceding modifiers, "inverse", to select the
inverse of the unit and "log" to select logarithmic units. For example "log
angstroms" to plot the logarithm of wavelength in Angstroms and "inv
microns" to plot inverse microns.  The various identifiers may be
abbreviated as words but the syntax is not sophisticated enough to
recognized standard scientific abbreviations such as mm for millimeter.

	   angstroms - Wavelength in Angstroms
	  nanometers - Wavelength in nanometers
	millimicrons - Wavelength in millimicrons
	     microns - Wavelength in microns
	 millimeters - Wavelength in millimeters
	  centimeter - Wavelength in centimeters
	      meters - Wavelength in meters
	       hertz - Frequency in hertz (cycles per second)
	   kilohertz - Frequency in kilohertz
	   megahertz - Frequency in megahertz
	    gigahertz - Frequency in gigahertz
	         m/s - Velocity in meters per second
	        km/s - Velocity in kilometers per second
	          ev - Energy in electron volts
	         kev - Energy in kilo electron volts
	         mev - Energy in mega electron volts
		   z - Redshift

The velocity and redshift units require a trailing value and unit defining the
velocity zero point.  For example to plot velocity relative to
a wavelength of 1 micron the unit string would be:

	km/s 1 micron
