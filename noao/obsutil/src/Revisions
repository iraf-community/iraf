sptime/t_sptime.x
    Made the graphs all auto-scale.  (11/14/08, Valdes)

    Added a "generic" disperser type to force using the desired wavelength
    and dispersion without defining a grating whose mapping between
    position on the detector and wavelength might be wrong.  Also fixed
    a couple of typos.  (11/13/08, Valdes)

doc/ccdtime.hlp
ccdtime/t_ccdtime.x
    In order to get more than five filters while not changing the parameters
    the f1-f5 input parameters may not be a comma delimited list of
    desired filters.  Note that whitespace is not stripped and the
    filter must match the string in the database so "U, V" will match
    "U" but not "V".  Instead use "U,V".  (9/21/06, Valdes)

V2.12.3
=======

t_sptime.x
    1. For fibers or circular aperture the area of the aperture applied to
    the sky flux was wrong because the size was treated as a radius instead
    of a diameter.
    2. In computing the sky flux reported the way seeing throughput was
    applied was wrong.  (1/5/05, Valdes)

V2.12.2a
========

grating.x
t_sptime.x
    Added some checks against unphysical parameters.
    (7/7/04, Valdes)

mkpkg
    Did not follow the standard convention of building xx_obsutil.e.

V2.12.2

sptime/t_sptime.x
sptime/sptime.par
sptime/sptime.h
    1.  Improved algorithm for handling saturation.
    2.  Added a minimum exposure parameter.
    (5/15/03, Valdes)

starfocus/stfprofile.x
    Limits on centroided image raster at the boundary have been removed.
    Instead boundary reflection allows a somewhat unbiased centroid estimation
    for sources near the edge.  (5/6/03, Valdes)

starfocus/t_starfocus.x
starfocus/starfocus.h
starfocus/mkpkg
    1.  Added 100 pixels of boundary reflection to allow some attempt at
	measuring PSFs near the image edges.
    2.  Now starting coordinates closer that a radius distance from the
	image edge are allowed.  (5/6/03, Valdes)

starfocus/stfprofile.x
    The selection of a point to get a first estimation of the FWHM in
    stf_fit did not check for the case of a zero value.  This could cause
    a floating divide by zero.  (5/5/03, Valdes)

starfocus/stfprofile.x
    The subpixel evaluation involves fitting an image interpolator to a
    subraster.  To avoid attempting to evaluate a point outside the center
    of the edge pixels, which is a requirement of the image interpolators,
    the interpolator is fit to the full data raster and the evaluations
    exclude the boundary pixels.  (5/5/03, Valdes)

ccdtime.par
t_ccdtime.x
    1.	The minimum seeing is now 0.001.
    2.  The formating of the seeing was changed in case the seeing is set
	less than 0.1.
    (4/24/03, Valdes)

t_sptime.x
    The thermal background calculation was wrong.  (3/17/03, Valdes)

../doc/cgiparse.hlp        +
../../obsutil.hd
    Added CGIPARSE task help.  (3/3/03, Valdes)

    Added CGIPARSE task.  (3/3/03, Valdes)
