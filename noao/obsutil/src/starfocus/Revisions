t_starfocus.x
starfocus.par
psfmeasure.par
starfocus.hlp
psfmeasure.hlp
    Added a "wcs" parameter to allow specifying the coordinate system type
    for cursor input.  (10/7/98, Valdes)

stfprofile.x
    The logic in STF_FIT for determining the points to fit and the point
    to use for the initial width estimate was faulty allowing some bad
    cases to get through.  (7/31/98, Valdes)

t_starfocus.x
    There was an error in the changes to allow focus sequences to go
    up or down such that simple PSF measurement failed.
    (6/11/97, Valdes)

stfmeasure.x
stfprofile.x
    Changes were need to better deal with error conditions.
    (6/11/97, Valdes)

stfmeasure.x
    Changes to deal with error conditions.
    (6/11/97, Valdes)

t_starfocus.x
    Fixed a typo error in an earlier change which left out the pointer
    variable in a macro.  (5/8/97, Valdes)

t_starfocus.x
    1.  Added a minimum radius of 3 to the input and to interative setting.
    2.  The estimate for the next focus position is not based on the previous
	center plus the step.
    3.  Added commented out code to allow setting the selected star to always
	be the top or bottom, etc.
    (2/7/97, Valdes)

stfprofile.x
    1.  Added a minimum radius of 3 to stf_find.
    2.  Added a error return if sum2 <= 0 in stf_find
    3.  Added errchks in stf_widths for called procedures.
    4.  Added error returns in stf_fit for bad profile or parameters.
    (2/6/97, Valdes)

t_starfocus.x
    The parabola fitting routine would fail if the independent variable
    (the focus values) became too large because a) use of real and b)
    unscaled variables.  The routine was revised for both these problems.
    (10/24/96, Valdes)

stfprofile.x
stfmeasure.x
    Fixed bug in evaluation of enclosed flux profile in which the scaled
    radius was used for the gaussian subtraction stage instead of pixels.
    This does not currently affect IMEXAM because the scale is fixed
    at 1.  (8/29/96, Valdes)

stfmeasure.x
stfprofile.x
    Fixed incorrect datatype declaration "real np" -> "int np" in various
    related places.  (4/9/96, Valdes)

stfmeasure.x -
    1. Restricted the peak pixel to be within the specified radius.
    2. Renamed file and procedures to avoid library conflict.
    (3/14/96, Valdes)

stfprofile.x
    Minor bug fix that does not affect anything.  (3/14/96, Valdes)

kpnofocus.cl
starfocus.par
psfmeasure.par
    Changed the defaults for radius=5, sbuffer=5, swidth=5 to try and make
    IMEXAMINE and the PSF tasks measure the same thing by default.
    (3/13/96, Valdes)

stfprofile.x
    Changed the centering routine to only use the data in the specified
    radius rather than the extended region including the sky.  (11/7/95, Valdes)

stfmeasure.x
mkpkg
    Added a routine which can be called separately to compute the
    enclosed flux width or radius and the direct FWHM.  (11/6/95, Valdes)

stfprofile.x
starfocus.h
    Added a computation of the direct FWHM.   (11/6/95, Valdes)

t_starfocus.x
    Make a change to avoid reloading the image display when the specified
    image name and the image name in the display are same apart from
    the image extension.  (6/26/95, Valdes)

stfprofile.h
t_starfocus.x
stfprofile.x
starfocus.par
psfmeasure.par
kpnofocus.cl
starfocus.par
psfmeasure.par
kpnofocus.cl
    Added saturation and ignore_sat parameters to allow flagging measurements
    with saturated pixels and either ignoring them or including them but
    showing them in the output log.  (10/28/94, Valdes)

t_starfocus.x
    Fixed bug in interpreting the focus parameter.  (9/15/94, Valdes)

starfocus.h
t_starfocus.x
stfprofile.x
stfgraph.x
psfmeasure.par
starfocus.par
kpnofocus.cl
psfmeasure.hlp
starfocus.hlp
kpnofocus.hlp
    Added an "iteration" parameter that, if greater than 1, uses the
    previous FWHM estimate to adjust the "radius" parameter.  (8/5/94, Valdes)

psfmeasure.hlp
starfocus.hlp
    Clarified the description of the imagecur parameter.  (2/1/94, Valdes)

starfocus.h
starfocus.par
psfmeasure.par
kpnofocus.cl	+
starfocus.hlp
psfmeasure.hlp
kpnofocus.hlp
    1.  A new parameter, fstep, was added to STARFOCUS to allow specifying
	the focus sequence as a starting value, by the focus parameters,
	and a step.
    2.  STARFOCUS was modified to allow specification of header keywords
	for the focus (this was true previously), the focus step,
	the number of exposures, and the multiple exposure shift.
	This allows multiple exposure images to be completely header
	drivien if the appropriate keywords are present.
    3.  A new task KPNOFOCUS was added.  This is a script calling
	STARFOCUS with parameters set specifically for Kitt Peak
	headers containing the focus parameters in the header.
	Many of the parameters are fixed in the script and the task
	parameters are then simpler.
    4.  STARFOCUS/PSFMEASURE were modified to search all display frames
	for the requested image rather than just frame 1.
    5.  A new parameters, frame, was added to STARFOCUS/PSFMEASURE
	to specify the display frame to load if necessary.  Previously
	it was always frame 1.
    7.  In STARFOCUS the default number of steps was changed to 7 and
	the default step size to 30.
