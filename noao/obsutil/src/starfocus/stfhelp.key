				CURSOR COMMANDS

All plots may not be available depending on the number of focus values and
the number of stars.

?	Page this help information
a	Spatial plot at a single focus
b	Spatial plot of best focus values
d	Delete star nearest to cursor
e	Enclosed flux for all stars at one focus and all focus for one star
f	Size and ellipticity vs focus for all data
i	Information about point nearest the cursor
m	Size and ellipticity vs relative magnitude at one focus
n	Normalize enclosed flux at x cursor position
o	Offset enclosed flux to x,y cursor position by adjusting background
p	Radial profiles for all stars at one focus and all focus for one star
          The profiles are determined from the derivatives of the enclosed flux
q	Quit
r	Redraw
s	Toggle magnitude symbols in spatial plots
t	Size and ellipticity vs radius from field center at one focus
u	Undelete all deleted points
x	Delete nearest point, star, or focus (selected by query)
z	Zoom to a single measurement showing enclosed flux and radial profile
<space> Step through different focus or stars in current plot type


			COLON COMMANDS

A command without a value generally shows the current value of the
parameter while with a value it sets the value of the parameter.

:level <val>	Level at which the size parameter is evaluated
:overplot <y|n> Overplot the profiles from the narrowest profile?
:radius <val>   Change profile radius(*)
:show <file>	Page all information for the current set of objects
:size <type>	Size type (Radius|FWHM|GFWHM|MFWHM) (**)
:scale <val>	Pixel scale for size values
:xcenter <val>	X field center for radius from field center plots
:ycenter <val>	Y field center for radius from field center plots

(*) The profile radius may not exceed the initial value set by the task
    parameter.

(**)
Radius = radius enclosing the fraction of the flux specified by "level"
FWHM   = Full-width at half-maximum based on the radially smoothed profile
GFWHM  = Full-width at half-maximum of Gaussian function fit to enclosed flux
MFWHM  = Full-width at half-maximum of Moffat function fit to enclosed flux
