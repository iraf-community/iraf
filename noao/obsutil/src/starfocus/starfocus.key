			COMMAND OPTIONS

?	Page this help information.
g	Measure object and graph the results.
m	Measure object.
q	Quit object marking and go to next image.
	At the end of all images go to analysis of all measurements.

:show	Show the current results.

When an object is measured the center and enclosed flux profile is determined.
When using the "mark1" option typing 'q' will measure all remaining images
at the same cursor positions while the "markall" option goes to the
next image until the image list is finished.  If measuring only one
object with the 'g' key then a 'q' will exit the program.
