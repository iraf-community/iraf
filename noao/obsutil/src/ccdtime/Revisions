V2.12.2

ccdtime.par
t_ccdtime.x
    1.	The minimum seeing is now 0.001.
    2.  The formating of the seeing was changed in case the seeing is set
	less than 0.1.

t_ccdtime.x
../doc/ccdtime.hlp
    It is now an error if time<0, time>10-000, abs(mag)>40, snr<0 or
    snr>100000.  (8/24/00, Valdes)

../doc/ccdtime.hlp
    In the formula for r(sky) was pixel area term was in the wrong place.
    (3/9/99, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x
    For the case where SNR is very large and a time is specified the
    iteration on the magnitude might not complete.  The iteration is now
    capped at 100 and the test for convergence is now normalized.
    (11/6/98, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x
../doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.  The calculation of exposure time given a SNR was changed from an
	interative solution to an analytic solution.
    2.  The times are printed to 0.01s.
    3.  The photometry aperture is now the rounded-up integer with a minimum
	of 9 pixels.
    (9/8/98, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x
ccddb.x
../doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.	The database keywords can now be index by reference to the telescope,
	filter, and/or telescope.
    2.  A new filter keyword, "extinction", was added to specify the
	extinction.
    3.	The extinction is now used to fixe the previous incorrect behavior
	that used 1 mag/airmass extinction.  The old results are preserved
	by making the default extinction be 1 if missing.  However the
	database files should be updated to have correct extinctions.
    (8/19/98, Valdes)

ccddb.x
../doc/ccdtime.hlp
    1.	The code would not work with database entries containing whitespace.
    2.	The help was not correct in describing how the number of pixels used
	in the photometry is calculated from the seeing FWHM.
    (4/5/94, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x
    Modified CCDTIME to use a plate scale instead of the f/ratio and to
    include an airmass term.  (10/23/93, Valdes)

t_ccdtime.x	+
ccddb.x		+
ccdtime.x	-
ccdtime.par
doc/ccdtime.hlp
    Revised CCDTIME to use a telescope/filter/detector database and to
    compute and print additional information.  (8/16/93, Valdes)
