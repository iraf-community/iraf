mktemplates.x
doc/mkobjects.hlp
    Added Sersic model profiles.  This was done using only the model
    name to avoid any additional parameters.  (2/24/11, Valdes)

=======
V2.15.2
=======

=======
V2.12.2
=======

mkheader.x
    The routine was not putting an EOS for lines longer than IDB_RECLEN
    resulting in cards longer than the FITS standard.
    (1/29/04, Valdes)

mktemplates.x
    Pointer procedure mkt_object() could return w/out value (12/29/03, MJF)

mkheader.x
    Added checks and warning messages for overflowing the user header
    area.  (11/10/03, Valdes)

t_mk1dspec.x
t_mkechelle.x
lists/t_starlist.x
lists/t_gallist.x
    The behavior of the random number seed used when specified as INDEF
    was changed to avoid the 1 second grandularity.  See buglog 528.
    (8/7/03, Valdes)

t_mknoise.x
    The string for the header file name was increased in length from
    LEN_COMMENT to SZ_FNAME.  (6/27/03, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

t_mkobjects.x
doc/mkobjects.hlp
    The star templates are now created only once when there is a list
    of input images.  There was also a bug in matching the objects
    list to the input list which didn't work and also did not agree with
    the help.  Now there must be a matching list.  (12/14/01, Valdes)

stdheader.dat
    The DATE-OBS had a syntax error, a ':' instead of 'T' separating the
    date and time.  (2/11/00, Valdes)

=========
V2.11.3p1
=========

stdheader.dat
mkexamples/archdr.dat
mkexamples/objhdr.dat
    Changed DATE-OBS to new FITS format.  (5/19/99, Valdes)
    

doc/mkobjects.hlp
doc/mkpattern.hlp
doc/mkechelle.hlp
    Fixed minor formating problems.  (4/22/99, Valdes)

doc/mkechelle.hlp
    Modified to indicate the input list is not exactly the same as MK1DSPEC
    since that task was modified to support different profile types.

    If the random number seed is specified as INDEF then the task will
    use the clock time (seconds since 1980) as the seed.  This allows
    users to get different random numbers for each execution.
    (9/23/97, Valdes)

t_mk1dspec.x
    If the dispersion was negative the task would fail to make the lines.
    (6/2/97, Valdes)

doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    Fixed minor typo.  (6/2/97, Valdes)

doc/mkpattern.hlp
    Updated for changes.  (4/22/97, Valdes)

artdata.par
doc/mknoise.hlp
doc/mkobjects.hlp
    Changed the default for "ranbuf" to zero.  (1/29/97, Valdes)

lists/stdbio.x
    The parameter information in the output now begins with #.
    (12/30/96, Valdes)

t_mknoise.x
t_mk1dspec.x
t_mk2dspec.x
t_mkechelle.x
t_mkobjects.x
t_mkpattern.x
    Changed logic to work around the fact that IMACCESS does not always
    work.  This became a problem with the FITS kernel.  (11/11/96, Valdes)

t_mkpattern.x
mkpattern.par
doc/mkpattern.hlp
    Added "ushort" and "complex" data types.  (11/8/96, Valdes)

numrecipes.x
    Modified the Poisson deviate routine to return zero for input
    values less than or equal to zero.  (10/1/96, Valdes)

lists/stdbio.x
    Modified the list formatting code to print the x and y centers of
    the objects to 3 decimal places of precision. (8/27/96, Davis)

mkpattern.par
    An ndim of zero is now allowed.  (8/15/96, Valdes)

mkobjects.par
doc/mkobjects.hlp
    Modified the prompt for "background" and the help page to indicate
    that the value is in data numbers.  (6/27/96, Valdes)

t_mkechelle.x
    The DC-FLAG was not being set correctly for raw extracted spectra.
    (4/26/96, Valdes)

doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    Minor clarification of how the peak parameter is used if a line
    list is given but there is not peak value.  (10/12/95, Valdes)

gallist.par
    Changed the "ar" parameter to a default value of 0.3 corresponding
    to the range E0 to E7.  (10/10/95, Valdes)

doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    1.	MK1DSPEC now includes gaussian, lorentzian, and voigt line profiles.
	There were parameter changes and changes to the input/output
	line lists.
    2.  The example scripts calling MK1DSPEC were modified for the changes
	to task though they still use only gaussian lines.  The spectra
	will not be exactly the same because the order of the random
	numbers has changed.
    (7/28/95, Valdes)

=======
V2.10.4
=======

artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
    Fixed two type mismatches in min/max calls.  (12/31/94, Valdes)

artdata$lists/stmix.x
    The calculation of absorption in spiral models was not working and
    so no absorption effect was being added as described in the help.
    This has been fixed.  (10/29/94, Valdes)

xtools$numrecipes.x
    The POIDEV routine can still have a problem in that the tan function
    can return a very large number triggering either an overflow in
    the evaluation of em or in the int truncation of em as addressed
    below.  A test is now made on the value of the tan function.
    (9/14/94, Valdes)

artdata$mknoise.par
artdata$doc/mknoise.hlp
    The help was inconsistent with the task in that any background specified
    is added to both new and existing images.  The discussion of subtracting
    the background in existing images was wrong.  The "background" parameter
    was moved in the par file from the NEW IMAGE section.
    (7/1/94, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    The structure parameter MKT_SCALE was incorrectly defined as an
    integer resulting in the output scales of the "expdisk" and "devauc"
    objects to be incorrect (see bug log 226).  (9/17/93, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkpattern.x
    Fixed bug in indexing.  This bug was most noticible with the checkerboard
    and a larger size which showed the first square was too small by 1.
    (9/2/93, Valdes)

artdata$mkexamples/longslit.cl
artdata$mkexamples/lsgal.cl +
artdata$twodspec.men
     Added an example,lsgal, of an extended longslit galaxy spectrum.
     (8/21/93, Valdes)

artdata$numrecipes.x
    The POIDEV routine from Numerical Recipes can try to coerce a large
    floating point number to an integer which can cause an exception.
    If the value is 100 or greater a Gaussian deviate is now returned.
    (8/11/93, Valdes)

=============
V2.10.3. beta
=============

artdata$t_mkobjects.x
artdata$t_mknoise.x
    The min/max data values are computed and set in the output image.
    (4/16/93, Valdes)

artdata$mkexamples
    1.  The MKEXAMPLES task now provides multiple menus.
    2.  The spectrum examples have been organized by type.
    3.  New spectrum examples have been added.
    4.  The echelle and onedspec examples use the oseed to set the number
	of orders/apertures.
    (3/17/93, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkechelle.x
artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
artdata$mk1dspec.par

mkpkg
    1.  Modified to use SMW WCS routines.
    2.  The mk1dspec.format parameter was eliminated.
    (3/17/93, Valdes)

artdata$mkheader.x
    Added a double type to mkh_comment1.  (3/17/93, Valdes)

artdata$mkobjects.x
artdata$doc/mkobjects.hlp
    Changed the behavior of xoffset and yoffset to be the offset after
    distance scaling to allow having a fixed origin.  (3/16/93, Valdes)

artdata$lists/stplot.x
    When there is only one object or when all objects have the same value
    then the symbol size scaling with amapr gave a floating operand error.
    A check has been added for this.  (3/16/93, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkechelle.x
    The method of generating random lines was incorrect.  This showed up
    when trying to make the same set of random lines with a different
    velocity.  (3/1/93, Valdes)

ardata$t_mkobjects.x
ardata$t_mknoise.x
ardata$t_mkechelle.x
ardata$t_mk2dspec.x
ardata$t_mk1dspec.x
ardata$mkheader.x
    Replaced use of '\t' in the comment with spaces. (11/12/92, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    In mkt_binprof there was no check that the central subpixels were
    within the profile.  For very small objects this could lead to
    out of bounds references in the prof array.  A check on this was
    added.  (10/30/92, Valdes)

artdata$t_mk2dspec.x
artdata$t_mkechelle.x
    Add a limit check to prevent integration of a pixel outside the profile
    interpolation function.   (8/14/92, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkechelle.x
    Changed a "** 1.5" to a combination of square root and an integer
    third power.  (8/10/92, Valdes)

artdata$mkexamples/*
artdata$doc/mkexamples.hlp
    Added parameter to control whether comments are generated in the
    examples.  (1/31/92, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplate.x
    Made substantial changes to how the user and analytic profiles are
    handled.  Primarily, the prefered form for both user supplied and
    analytic profiles is as intensity profiles rather than cumulative
    flux profiles.  Cumulative profiles may still be input and they are
    identified by having a zero initial element.  (12/13/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    Very large gaussians showed an dip in the center due to problems with
    mkt_fixprof.  A better algorithm was instituted.  (12/11/91, Valdes)

artdata$lists/stmix.x
    1.  The random component of the size distribution for the Schecter function
    was incorrect.  It was giving a 100% random factor and was reducing
    the size by 40%.  The fix is 0.2 + 0.4 * urand() ==> 0.8 + 0.4 * urand().
    2.  The roundness distribution for ellipical galaxies was done incorrectly.
    (11/26/91, Valdes)

artdata$lists/stdbio.x
    Instead of putting out beta in the log for the schecter function changed
    to put out mstar.  (11/26/91, Valdes)

artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
artdata$t_mkechelle.x
    Fixed minor bugs found by SPPLINT.  (11/21/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates2.x
artdata$lists/stlumold.x
    Delete old versions.  (11/21/91, Valdes)

artdata$doc/t_mkpattern.x
    Fixed an error in mkpattern:
	max (1, (line-1))  -->  max (1, line)
    (10/15/91, Valdes)

artdata$doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    Need to indicate that the blackbody flux is per unit wavelength.
    (10/9/91, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkpattern.x
    For 1D images the pattern made corresponded to line 0 instead of line 1.
    (7/26/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    The PSF position angle was not being converted to radians from degrees
    with the result that the input was interpreted as radians.  The
    conversion with DEGTORAD was added.  (6/10/91, Valdes)

    1.  Separated out header stuff into separate file.
    2.  Changed format of header keyword file to be FITS-like including
	understanding the output of IMHEADER.  The default file
	stdheader.dat was changed appropriately.
    3.  Added capability to copy an image header when creating a new
	image.
    4.  MKHEADER can append or replace a header from an image or
	a header keyword file.  The clobber parameter was changed
	to append.  The verbose parameter now lists only the image
	and source of header changes rather than individual keywords.
    (1/16/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    Fixed bug preventing template memory stored in the symbol table
    from being freed.  (12/4/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkobjects.x
    1. Added object list file name to the header comments.
    2. Fixed bug which caused objects which went off the edge and were
       exactly at a half pixel boundry (i.e. 32.5) to end up off by one
       pixel.
    (10/23/90, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    Replaced use of i as the function value returned by immap and open
    with im and fd respectively.  For unknown reasons the HPUX compiler
    left the value of i at 0 after the function call.  (10/10/90, Valdes)

    1.  A new task, MKHEADER, has been added to add or modify image headers
	using a header keyword data file.
    2.  The tasks MKOBJECTS, MKNOISE, MK1DSPEC, and MK2DSPEC have a new
	parameter, header, which allows specifying a header keyword data
	file.  A standard header data file is used as the default.
    3.  The tasks MKOBJECTS, MKNOISE, MK1DSPEC, and MK2DSPEC add some
	some header parameters such as gain, rdnoise, and exptime as
	well as extensively comment task and data file parameters.
    4.  The package version number was incremented.

artdata$mktemplates.x
    1.  The logic for discriminating between an image template and profile
	file doesn't work because IMACCESS does not check if the file is
	an image.  Modified to use an error check on IMMAP.
    2.  The ACCESS call to test for access to a profile file had a missing
	third argument causing a segmentation error on at least Sun3.
    3.  For the star profile input an initialization of nxm was missing
	and a malloc used nxm instead of j resulting in an alloc of 0 length.
    Basically the profile file input was not working.  (8/9/90, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    The gaussian radius was being treated as a full width resulting in
    stars which are half that expected.  (7/19/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkobjects
    A rounding error for objects which go off the
    lower edges was causing the objects to appear one pixel offset to larger
    numbers.  Replaced rounding done by adding 0.5 by nint.  (7/2/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
artdata$mk1dspec.par
