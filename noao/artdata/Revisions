V2.10
=====

artdata$mkexamples/*
artdata$doc/mkexamples.hlp
    Added parameter to control whether comments are generated in the
    examples.  (1/31/92, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplate.x
    Made substantial changes to how the user and analytic profiles are
    handled.  Primarily, the prefered form for both user supplied and
    analytic profiles is as intensity profiles rather than cumulative
    flux profiles.  Cumulative profiles may still be input and they are
    identified by having a zero initial element.  (12/13/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    Very large gaussians showed an dip in the center due to problems with
    mkt_fixprof.  A better algorithm was instituted.  (12/11/91, Valdes)

artdata$lists/stmix.x
    1.  The random component of the size distribution for the Schecter function
    was incorrect.  It was giving a 100% random factor and was reducing
    the size by 40%.  The fix is 0.2 + 0.4 * urand() ==> 0.8 + 0.4 * urand().
    2.  The roundness distribution for ellipical galaxies was done incorrectly.
    (11/26/91, Valdes)

artdata$lists/stdbio.x
    Instead of putting out beta in the log for the schecter function changed
    to put out mstar.  (11/26/91, Valdes)

artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
artdata$t_mkechelle.x
    Fixed minor bugs found by SPPLINT.  (11/21/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates2.x
artdata$lists/stlumold.x
    Delete old versions.  (11/21/91, Valdes)

artdata$doc/t_mkpattern.x
    Fixed an error in mkpattern:
	max (1, (line-1))  -->  max (1, line)
    (10/15/91, Valdes)

artdata$doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    Need to indicate that the blackbody flux is per unit wavelength.
    (10/9/91, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkpattern.x
    For 1D images the pattern made corresponded to line 0 instead of line 1.
    (7/26/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    The PSF position angle was not being converted to radians from degrees
    with the result that the input was interpreted as radians.  The
    conversion with DEGTORAD was added.  (6/10/91, Valdes)

    1.  Added new artificial echelle task.
    2.  Added echelle examples.
    3.  Fixed minor bug in MK1DSPEC concerning header format of wend parameter.

  stdheader.dat
    1.  Separated out header stuff into separate file.
    2.  Changed format of header keyword file to be FITS-like including
	understanding the output of IMHEADER.  The default file
	stdheader.dat was changed appropriately.
    3.  Added capability to copy an image header when creating a new
	image.
    4.  MKHEADER can append or replace a header from an image or
	a header keyword file.  The clobber parameter was changed
	to append.  The verbose parameter now lists only the image
	and source of header changes rather than individual keywords.
    (1/16/91, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    Fixed bug preventing template memory stored in the symbol table
    from being freed.  (12/4/90, Valdes)

    1. MK1DSPEC now can create multispec/echelle format images.
    2. Added switch to turn off comments.
    (11/7/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkobjects.x
    1. Added object list file name to the header comments.
    2. Fixed bug which caused objects which went off the edge and were
       exactly at a half pixel boundry (i.e. 32.5) to end up off by one
       pixel.
    (10/23/90, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    Replaced use of i as the function value returned by immap and open
    with im and fd respectively.  For unknown reasons the HPUX compiler
    left the value of i at 0 after the function call.  (10/10/90, Valdes)

    1.  A new task, MKEXAMPLES, has been added to make some standard examples
	for demonstrations and task scripts in this and other packages.
    2.  The task is driven by simple script files located in the logical
	directory mkexamples$.

    1.  A new task, MKHEADER, has been added to add or modify image headers
	using a header keyword data file.
    2.  The tasks MKOBJECTS, MKNOISE, MK1DSPEC, and MK2DSPEC have a new
	parameter, header, which allows specifying a header keyword data
	file.  A standard header data file is used as the default.
    3.  The tasks MKOBJECTS, MKNOISE, MK1DSPEC, and MK2DSPEC add some
	some header parameters such as gain, rdnoise, and exptime as
	well as extensively comment task and data file parameters.
    4.  The package version number was incremented.

artdata$mktemplates.x
    1.  The logic for discriminating between an image template and profile
	file doesn't work because IMACCESS does not check if the file is
	an image.  Modified to use an error check on IMMAP.
    2.  The ACCESS call to test for access to a profile file had a missing
	third argument causing a segmentation error on at least Sun3.
    3.  For the star profile input an initialization of nxm was missing
	and a malloc used nxm instead of j resulting in an alloc of 0 length.
    Basically the profile file input was not working.  (8/9/90, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    The gaussian radius was being treated as a full width resulting in
    stars which are half that expected.  (7/19/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkobjects
    A rounding error for objects which go off the
    lower edges was causing the objects to appear one pixel offset to larger
    numbers.  Replaced rounding done by adding 0.5 by nint.  (7/2/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
artdata$mk1dspec.par
artdata$doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    Added redshifting capability.  (5/18/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkpattern.x
    The COORDINATES pattern was off by 1.  (3/12/90, Valdes)

artdata$
    Davis, Feb 19, 1990
    1. The STARLIST and GALLIST tasks for making artificial star and
    galaxies fields were added to the artdata package.

artdata$* +
    First version of the artificial data package installed.  (2/1/90, Valdes)
