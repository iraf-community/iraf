    1.  A new task, MKEXAMPLES, has been added to make some standard examples
	for demonstrations and task scripts in this and other packages.
    2.  The task is driven by simple script files located in the logical
	directory mkexamples$.

    1.  A new task, MKHEADER, has been added to add or modify image headers
	using a header keyword data file.
    2.  The tasks MKOBJECTS, MKNOISE, MK1DSPEC, and MK2DSPEC have a new
	parameter, header, which allows specifying a header keyword data
	file.  A standard header data file is used as the default.
    3.  The tasks MKOBJECTS, MKNOISE, MK1DSPEC, and MK2DSPEC add some
	some header parameters such as gain, rdnoise, and exptime as
	well as extensively comment task and data file parameters.
    4.  The package version number was incremented.

artdata$mktemplates.x
    1.  The logic for discriminating between an image template and profile
	file doesn't work because IMACCESS does not check if the file is
	an image.  Modified to use an error check on IMMAP.
    2.  The ACCESS call to test for access to a profile file had a missing
	third argument causing a segmentation error on at least Sun3.
    3.  For the star profile input an initialization of nxm was missing
	and a malloc used nxm instead of j resulting in an alloc of 0 length.
    Basically the profile file input was not working.  (8/9/90, Valdes)

artdata$mktemplates.x
    The gaussian radius was being treated as a full width resulting in
    stars which are half that expected.  (7/19/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkobjects
    A rounding error for objects which go off the
    lower edges was causing the objects to appear one pixel offset to larger
    numbers.  Replaced rounding done by adding 0.5 by nint.  (7/2/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mk1dspec.x
artdata$mk1dspec.par
artdata$doc/mk1dspec.hlp
    Added redshifting capability.  (5/18/90, Valdes)

artdata$t_mkpattern.x
    The COORDINATES pattern was off by 1.  (3/12/90, Valdes)

artdata$
    Davis, Feb 19, 1990
    1. The STARLIST and GALLIST tasks for making artificial star and
    galaxies fields were added to the artdata package.

artdata$* +
    First version of the artificial data package installed.  (2/1/90, Valdes)
