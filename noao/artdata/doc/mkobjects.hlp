.ih
USAGE
mkobjects input
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls input
Images to create or modify.
.le
.ls output = ""
Output images when modifying input images.  If no output images are
given then existing images in the input list are modified directly.
If an output image list is given then it must match in number the
input list.
.le

WHEN CREATING NEW IMAGES
.ls title = ""
Image title to be given to the images.  Maximum of 79 characters.
.le
.ls ncols = 512, nlines = 512
Number of columns and lines.
.le
.ls header = "artdata$stdheader.dat"
Image or header keyword data file.  If an image is given then the image header
is copied.  If a file is given then the FITS format cards are copied.
This only applies to new images.   The data file consists of lines
in FITS format with leading whitespace ignored.  A FITS card must begin
with an uppercase/numeric keyword.  Lines not beginning with a FITS
keyword such as comments or lower case are ignored.  The user keyword
output of \fBimheader\fR is an acceptable data file.  See \fBmkheader\fR
for further information.
.le
.ls background = 1000.
Default background and poisson noise background.  This is in data numbers
with the conversion to photons determined by the \fIgain\fR parameter.
.le

OBJECT PARAMETERS
.ls objects = ""
List of object files.  The number of object files must match the number of
input images.  The object files contain lines of object coordinates,
magnitudes, and shape parameters (see the DESCRIPTION section).
.le
.ls xoffset = 0.,  yoffset = 0.
X and Y coordinate offset to be added to the object list coordinates.
.le
.ls star = "moffat"
Type of star and point spread function.  The choices are:
.ls gaussian
An elliptical Gaussian profile with major axis half-intensity radius
given by the parameter \fIradius\fR, axial ratio given by the parameter
\fIar\fR, and position angle given by the parameter \fIpa\fR.
.le
.ls moffat
An elliptical Moffat profile with major axis half-intensity radius
given by the parameter \fIradius\fR, model parameter \fIbeta\fR,
axial ratio given by the parameter \fIar\fR, and position angle given
by the parameter \fIpa\fR.
.le
.ls <image>
If not one of the profiles above, an image of the specified name is
sought.  If found the center of the template image is assumed to be the
center of the star/psf and the image template is scaled so that the
radius of the template along the first axis is given by the \fIradius\fR
parameter.  The axial ratio and position angle define an
elliptical sampling of the template.
.le
.ls <profile file>
If not one of the above, a text file is sought giving either an intensity
per unit area profile or a cumulative flux profile from the center to the
edge.  The two are differentiated by whether the first profile point is 0
for a cumulative profile or nonzero for an intensity profile.  An intensity
profile is recommended.  If found the profile defines an elliptical star/psf
with the major axis radius to the last profile point given by the parameter
\fIradius\fR, axial ratio given by the parameter \fIar\fR, and position
angle given by the parameter \fIpa\fR.
.le
.le
.ls radius = 1.
Seeing radius/scale in pixels along the major axis.  For the "gaussian"
and "moffat" profiles this is the half-intensity radius of the major
axis, for image templates this is the template radius along the x dimension,
specifically one half the number of columns, and for arbitrary user profiles
this is the radius to the last profile point.
.le
.ls beta = 2.5
Moffat model parameter.  See the DESCRIPTION for a definition of the
Moffat profile.
.le
.ls ar = 1.
Minor to major axial ratio for the star/psf.
.le
.ls pa = 0.
Position angle in degrees measured counterclockwise from the X axis
for the star/psf.
.le
.ls distance = 1.
Relative distance to be applied to the object list coordinates,
magnitudes, and scale sizes.  This factor is divided into the
object coordinates, after adding the offset factors, to allow expanding
or contracting about any origin.  The magnitudes scale as the
square of the distance and the sizes of the galaxies scale
linearly.  This parameter allows changing image sizes and fluxes
at a given seeing and sampling with one value.
.le
.ls exptime = 1.
Relative exposure time.  The object magnitudes and background
level are scaled by this parameter.  This is comparable to changing the
magnitude zero point except that it includes changing the background.
.le
.ls magzero = 7.
Magnitude zero point defining the conversion from magnitudes in the
object list to instrumental/image fluxes.
.le

NOISE PARAMETERS
.ls gain = 1.
Gain in electrons per data number.  The gain is used for scaling the
read noise parameter, the background, and in computing poisson noise.
.le
.ls rdnoise = 0.
Gaussian read noise in electrons.  For new images this applies to the
entire image while for existing images this is added only to the objects.
.le
.ls poisson = no
Add poisson photon noise?  For new images this applies to the entire image
while for existing images this is only applied to the objects.  Note
that in the latter case the background parameter is added before
computing the new value and then subtracted again.
.le
.ls seed = 1
Random number seed.  If a value of "INDEF" is given then the clock
time (integer seconds since 1980) is used as the seed yielding
different random numbers for each execution.
.le

.ls comments = yes
Include comments recording task parameters in the image header?
.le

PACKAGE PARAMETERS

These parameters define certain computational shortcuts which greatly
affect the computational speed.  They should be adjusted with care.
.ls nxc = 5, nyc = 5
Number of star and psf centers per pixel in X and Y.  Rather than evaluate
stars and the psf convolution functions precisely at each subpixel
coordinate, a set of templates with a grid of subpixel centers is
computed and then the nearest template to the desired position is chosen.
The larger the number the more memory and startup time required.
.le
.ls nxsub = 10, nysub = 10
Number of pixel subsamples in X and Y used in computing the star and
psf.  This is the subsampling in the central
pixel and the number of subsamples decreases linearly from the center.
The larger the numbers the longer it takes to compute the star and psf
convolution templates.
.le
.ls nxgsub = 5, nygsub = 5
Number of pixel subsamples in X and Y used in computing galaxy images.
This is the subsampling in the central pixel and the number of
subsamples decreases linearly from the center.  Because galaxy images
are extended and each subsample is convolved by the psf convolution it
need not be as finely sampled as the stars.  This is a critical
parameter in the execution time if galaxies are being modeled.
The larger the numbers the longer the execution time.
.le
.ls dynrange = 100000., psfrange = 10.
The intensity profiles of the analytic functions extend to infinity so
a dynamic range, the ratio of the peak intensity to the cutoff
intensity, is imposed to cutoff the profiles.  The \fIdynrange\fR
parameter applies to the stellar templates and to the galaxy profiles.
The larger this parameter the further the profile extends.
When modeling galaxies this has a fairly
strong affect on the time (larger numbers means larger images and more
execution time).  Only for very high signal-to-noise
objects will the cutoff be noticeable.  A correction is made to
the object magnitudes to reflect light lost by this cutoff.

The psf convolution, used on galaxies, is generally not
evaluated over as large a dynamic range, given by the parameter
\fIpsfrange\fR, especially since it has a very strong affect on the
execution time.  The convolution is normalized to unit weight over the
specified dynamic range.
.le
.ls ranbuf = 0
Random number buffer size.  When generating readout and poisson noise,
evaluation of new random values has an affect on the execution time.
If truly (or computationally truly) random numbers are not needed
then this number of random values is stored and a simple
uniform random number is used to select from the stored values.
To force evaluation of new random values for every pixel set the
value of this parameter to zero.

DESCRIPTION
This task creates or modifies images by adding models of astronomical
objects, stars and galaxies, as specified in object lists.  New images are
created with the specified dimensions, background, title, and real datatype.
Existing images may be modified in place or new images output.  The
task includes the effects of image scale, pixel sampling, atmospheric
seeing, and noise.  The object models may be analytic one dimensional
profiles, user defined one dimensional profiles, and user defined image
templates.  The profiles and templates are given elliptical shapes by
specifying a scale radius for the major axis, a minor axis to major
axis axial ratio, and a position angle.

For new images a set of header keywords may be added by specifying an
image or data file with the \fIheader\fR parameter (see also \fBmkheader\fR).
If a data file is specified lines beginning with FITS keywords are
entered in the image header.  Leading whitespace is ignored and any
lines beginning with words having lowercase and nonvalid FITS keyword
characters are ignored.  In addition to this optional header,
keywords, parameters for the gain, read noise, and exposure time are
defined.  Finally, comments may be added to the image header recording the task
parameters and any information from the objects file which are not
object definitions; in particular, the \fBstarlist\fR and
\fBgallist\fR parameters are recorded.

A completely accurate simulation of the effects of pixel sampling,
atmospheric seeing, object appearance, luminosity functions, and noise
can require a large amount of computer time even on
supercomputers.  This task is intended to allow generation of large
numbers of objects and images over large image sizes representative of
current deep optical astronomical images.  All this is to be done
on typical workstations.  Thus, there are many approximations and
subtle algorithms used to make this possible to as high a degree of
accuracy as practical.  The discussion will try to describe these in
sufficient detail for the user to judge the accuracy of the artificial
data generated and understand the trade offs with many of the
parameters.

New images are created with the specified dimensions, title, and real
datatype.  The images have a constant background value given by the
\fIbackground\fR parameter (in data numbers) before adding objects and
noise.  Noise consists of gaussian and poisson components.  For existing
images, noise is only added to the objects and the background parameter is
used in the calculation of the poisson noise: specifically, a poisson
random value with mean given by the sum of the object and the background is
generated and then the background is subtracted.  For more on how the noise
is computed and approximations used see \fBmknoise\fR.

Objects are specified by a position, magnitude, model, scale, axial
ratio, and position angle.  Since the point spread function (PSF)
is assumed constant over the image the star model, size, axial ratio,
and position angle are specified by the task parameters \fIstar\fR,
\fIradius\fR, \fIar\fR, and \fIpa\fR.  For galaxies, where the
intrinsic shapes vary from object to object, these parameters are
specified as part of the object lists.  For both types of objects the
positions and magnitudes are specified in the object lists.

There is a great deal of flexibility in defining the object models.
The models are defined either in terms of a one dimensional radial
intensity or cumulative flux profile
or an image template.  The flux profiles may be
analytic functions or a user defined profile given as an equally spaced
set of values in a text file.  The first point is zero at the center
for a cumulative profile
and increases monotonically to the edge.  Note that intensity profiles
are to be preferred to avoid artifacts in the conversion from cumulative
flux.  In particular, cumulative flux profiles may give a spike at the
center.  In either case, the profile should be specified fairly finely,
many points, to avoid interpolation effects.

The functional form of the analytic profiles the user profiles, and
image template are given below.

.nf
      gaussian:  I = exp (-ln (2) * (R/radius)**2)
        moffat:  I = (1 + (2**(1/beta)-1) * (R/radius)**2) ** -beta
     sersic<n>:  I = exp (-b * (R/radius)**1/n)
       expdisk:  I = exp (-1.6783 * R/radius)
        devauc:  I = exp (-7.67 * (R/radius)**1/4)
  flux profile:  I = intensity (nprofile * R/radius)
  flux profile:  F = flux (nprofile * R/radius)
image template:  I = image (nc/2+nc/2*dX/radius, nl/2+nc/2*dY/radius)
.fi

where R, dX, and dY are defined below, \fIradius\fR is the scale parameter
and \fIbeta\fR is the Moffat parameter specified by the user,
nprofile is the number of profile points in the user profile, and nc and nl
are the image template column and line dimensions.  The Gaussian, "gaussian",
and Moffat, "moffat", profiles are used for stars and the point spread
function, while the Sersic (sersic),  exponential disk (expdisk), and
De Vaucouleurs (devauc) profiles are common models for spiral and elliptical
galaxies.  The image templates are intended to model images with
some complex structure.  The usual case is to have a very well sampled
and high signal-to-noise image be reduced in scale (a more distant
example), convolved with seeing (loss of detail), and noise (degraded
signal-to-noise).  This also allows for more complex point spread
functions.

The radial profiles are mapped into two dimensional objects by an elliptical
transformation.  The image templates are also mapped by an elliptical
transformation to rotate and stretch them.  If the output image
coordinates are given by (x, y), and the specified object center
coordinates are given by (xc, yc) then the transformation is defined
as shown below.

.nf
	dx = x - xc
	dy = y - yc
	dX = dx * cos(pa) + dy * sin(pa)
	dY = (-dx * sin(pa) + dy * cos(pa)) / ar
	R = sqrt (dX ** 2 + dY ** 2)
.fi

where dx and dy are the object coordinates relative to the object
center,  dX and dY are the object coordinates in the transformed
circular coordinates, and R is the circularly symmetric radius.
The transformation parameters are the axial ratio \fIar\fR
defined as the ratio of the minor axis to the major axis,
and the position angle \fIpa\fR defined counterclockwise from
the x axis.

The \fIradius\fR parameter defines the size, in pixels, of the model
object (before seeing for the galaxies) in the output image.  It
consistently refers to the major axis of the object but its meaning
does depend on the model.  For the gaussian and moffat profiles it is
defined as the half-intensity radius.  For the sersic, expdisk, and devauc
profiles it is defined as the half-flux radius.  For the user specified
profiles it is the radius of the last profile point.  And for the image
templates it is the radius of the image along the first or x axis given
by one-half of the image dimension; i.e. nc/2.

The profiles of the analytic functions extend to infinity so a dynamic
range, the ratio of the peak intensity to the cutoff intensity, is imposed
to cutoff the profiles.  The \fIdynrange\fR package parameter applies to
the stellar and galaxy analytic profiles.  The larger this parameter the
further the profile extends, particularly for the large index Sersic and De
Vaucouleurs models.  When modeling large galaxies this has a fairly strong
affect on the execution time because the overall extent of the images
becomes rapidly greater.  Only for very high signal-to-noise objects will
the cutoff be noticeable.  A correction is made to account for lost light
(light beyond the modeled dynamic range) so that an aperture magnitude
will give the correct value for an object of the specified total magnitude.
This can become quite significant for larger index Sersic profiles and
for the default dynamic range.

The object models are integrated over the size of the image pixels.  This
is done by subsampling, dividing up a pixel into smaller pieces called
subpixels.  For the image templates a bilinear surface interpolation
function is used and integrated analytically over the extent of the
subpixels.  The user cumulative one dimensional profiles are first
converted to intensity profiles.  The various intensity profiles are then
binned into pixel fluxes per subpixel on a grid much finer than the
subpixel spacing.  Then for any particular radius and object center the
appropriate subpixel flux can be determined quickly and accurately.

The number of subpixels per image pixel is determined by the package
parameters \fInxsub\fR, \fInysub\fR, \fInxgsub\fR, and \fInygsub\fR.  The
first two apply to the stars and the PSF and the latter two apply to the
galaxies.  Typically the subsampling will be the same in each dimension.
The galaxies are generally  subsampled less since they will have less
rapidly changing profiles and are convolved by the PSF.  Also, the stars
are computed only a few times and then scaled and moved, as described
below, while each galaxy needs to be computed separately.  Therefore, one
can afford greater precision in the stars than in the galaxies.

Given an image of several hundred pixels subsampled by a factor of 100
(10 x 10) this will be a very large number of computations.  A
shortcut to reduce this number of operations is allow the number
of subpixels to change as a function of distance from the
profile center.  Since the profile center is where the intensity
changes most rapidly with position, the greatest subsampling is needed for
the pixel nearest the center.  Further from the object center the intensity
changes more slowly and the number of subpixels may be reduced.
Thus, the number of subpixels in each dimension in each pixel is
decreased linearly with distance from the profile center.  For example,
a pixel which is 3.2 pixels from the profile center will have
\fInxsub\fR - 3 subpixels in the x dimension.  There is, of course, a
minimum of one subpixel per pixel or, in other words, no subsampling
for the outer parts of the objects.  By adjusting the subsampling
parameters one can set the degree of accuracy desired at the trade off of
greatly different execution times.

The star shapes are assumed constant over the images and only their
position and magnitude change.  Thus, rather than compute each desired
star from the model profile or image template, a normalized star
template is computed once, using the spatial transformation and
subsampling operations described above, and simply scaled each time to
achieve the desired magnitude and added at the requested position.
However, the apparent star shape does vary depending on where its
center lies within an image pixel.  To handle this a set of
normalized star templates is precomputed over a grid of centers
relative to the center of a pixel.  Then the template with center
nearest to that requested, relative to a pixel center, is used.  The
number of such templates is set by the package parameters \fInxc\fR and
\fInyc\fR where the two axis typically have the same values.  The
larger the number of centers the more memory and startup time required
but the better the representation of this sampling effect.  The choice
also depends on the scale of the stars since the larger the star
profile compared to a pixel the smaller the subcentering effect is.
This technique allows generating images with many stars, such as a
globular cluster or a low galactic latitude field, quite
efficiently.

Unlike the stars, the galaxies will each have different profiles,
ellipticities, and position angles and so templates cannot be used (except
for special test cases as mentioned later).  Another difference is that the
galaxy models need to be convolved by the PSF; i.e. the shapes are defined
prior to seeing.  The PSF convolution must also be subsampled and the
convolution operation requires as many operations as the number of pixels
in the PSF for each galaxy subpixel.  Thus, computing seeing convolved,
well subsampled, large galaxy images is the most demanding task of all,
requiring all the shortcuts described above (larger and variable
subsampling and the subpixel flux approximation) as well as further ones.

The PSF used for convolving galaxies is truncated at a lower dynamic
range than the stars according to the package parameter
\fIpsfrange\fR.  This reduces the number of elements in the convolution
dramatically at the expense of losing only a small amount of the flux
in the wings.  Like the stars, the PSF is precomputed on a grid of
pixel subcenters and the appropriate PSF template is used for each
galaxy subpixel convolution.  Unlike the stars, the truncated PSF is
normalized to unit flux in order to conserve the total flux in the
galaxies.  For the extended galaxies this approximation has only a very
small effect.  As with the other approximations one may increase the
dynamic range of the PSF at the expense of an increase in execution
time.

There is an exception to using the truncated PSF.  If the size of the
galaxy because very small, 0.01 pixel, then a stellar image is substituted.

OBJECT FILES

The object files contain lines defining stars and galaxies.  Stars
are defined by three numbers and galaxies by seven or eight as
represented symbolically below.

.nf
           stars:  xc yc magnitude
        galaxies:  xc yc magnitude model radius ar pa <save>
.fi

.ls 6 xc, yc:
Object center coordinates.  These coordinates are transformed to image
coordinates as follows.

.nf
	xc in image = xoffset + xc / distance
	yc in image = yoffset + yc / distance
.fi

where \fIxoffset\fR and \fIyoffset\fR are the task offset parameters.
Objects whose image centers fall outside the image dimensions are ignored.
.le
.ls magnitude:
Object magnitude.  This is converted to instrumental fluxes as follows.

.nf
	flux = exptime/distance**2 * 10**(-0.4*(magnitude-magzero))
.fi

where \fIexptime\fR, \fIdistance\fR, and \fImagzero\fR are task parameters.
For the analytic star and galaxy models a correction
is made for lost light due to the finite extent of the image in the
sense that the flux added to the image will never quite be that
requested.
.le
.ls model:
The types of galaxy models are as follows:
.ls 4 sersic<n>
A Sersic model of index n.  The index may real but the value will be rounded
to the nearest multiple of 0.5 or, equivalently, two times the index value will
be rounded to an integer.  The index must be between 0.5 and 10.  The Sersic
model defined as

.nf
	I = exp (-b * (R/radius)**1/n)
.fi

where radius is the major axis scale length corresponding to half of the
total flux.  The value of b is computed using the formula of Ciotti and
Bertin (AA v352, p447, 1999);

.nf
	b = 2n - 1/3 + 4/(405n) + 46 / (25515n^2)
.fi
.le
.ls 4 expdisk
An exponential disk model defined as

.nf
	I = exp (-b * R/radius)
.fi

where radius is the major axis scale length corresponding to half of the total
flux and b is computed as with the Sersic model for n=1.  In fact, the
algorithm is identical with that for the Sersic model using n=1.  Note that
because of this there will be slight differences with the earlier versions.
.le
.ls devauc
A De Vaucouleurs profile defined as

.nf
	I = exp (-b * (R/radius)**1/4)
.fi

where radius is the major axis scale length corresponding to half of the total
flux and b is computed as with the Sersic model for n=4.  In fact, the
algorithm is identical with that for the Sersic model using n=4.  Note that
because of this there will be slight differences with the earlier versions.
.le
.ls <image>
If not one of the profiles above an image of the specified name is
sought.  If found the center of the template image is assumed to be the
center of the object and the image template is scaled so that the
radius of the template is given by the major axis scale radius parameter.
.le
.ls <profile file>
If not one of the above a text file giving a cumulative flux profile from
the center to the edge is sought.  If found the profile defines
a model galaxy of extent to the last profile point given by
the major axis scale radius parameter.
.le
.le
.ls 6 radius:
Major axis scale radius parameter in pixels as defined above for the different
galaxy models.  The actual image radius is modified as follows.

	radius in image = radius / distance
.le
.ls ar:
Minor to major axis axial ratio.
.le
.ls pa:
Major axis position angle in degrees measured counterclockwise from the X axis.
.le
.ls save:
If a large number of identically shaped galaxies (size, axial ratio,
and position angle) located at the same subpixel (the same x and y
fractional part) but with varying magnitudes is desired then by
putting the word "yes" as the eighth field the model will be saved
the first time and reused subsequent times.  This speeds up the execution.
There may certain algorithm testing situations where this might be useful.

EXAMPLES
1. Create a galaxy cluster with a power law distribution of field galaxies
and stars as background/foreground.

.nf
    ar> gallist galaxies.dat 100 spatial=hubble lum=schecter egal=.8
    ar> gallist galaxies.dat 500
    ar> starlist galaxies.dat 100
    ar> mkobjects galaxies obj=galaxies.dat gain=3 rdnoise=10 poisson+
.fi

Making the image takes about 5 minutes (2.5 min cpu) on a SPARCstation 1.

2. Create a uniform artificial starfield of 5000 stars for a 512 square image.

.nf
    ar> starlist starfield.dat 5000
    ar> mkobjects starfield obj=starfield.dat gain=2 rdnoise=10 poisson+
.fi

This example takes about a minute on a SPARCstation 1.

3. Create a globular cluster field of 5000 stars for a 512 square image.

.nf
    ar> starlist gc.dat 5000 spat=hubble lum=bands
    ar> mkobjects gc obj=gc.dat gain=2 rdnoise=10 poisson+
.fi

This example takes about a minute on a SPARCstation 1.

4. Add stars to an existing image for test purposes.

.nf
    ar> mkobjects starfield obj=STDIN gain=2 pois+ magzero=30
    100 100 20
    100 200 21
    200 100 22
    200 200 23
    [EOF]
.fi

5. Look at the center of the globular cluster with no noise and very
good seeing.

.nf
	cl> mkobjects gc1 obj=gc.dat nc=400 nl=400 distance=.5 \
	>>> xo=-313 yo=-313 radius=.1
.fi

The offset parameters are used to recenter the cluster from
(256,256) in the data file to (200,200) in the expanded field.
This example takes 30 sec (5 sec CPU) on a SPARCstation 1.  To expand
and contract about a fixed point define the object list to have an
origin at zero.

.nf
    ar> starlist gc.dat 5000 spat=hubble lum=bands xmin=-256 xmax=256 \
    >>> ymin=-256 ymax=256
    ar> mkobjects gc obj=gc.dat xo=257 yo=257 gain=2 rdnoise=10 poisson+
    ar> mkobjects gc1 obj=gc.dat xo=257 yo=257 gain=2 \
    >>> distance=.5 rdnoise=10 poisson+
.fi

6. Make an image of dev$pix at various distances and orientation.  First we
must subtract the background.

.nf
	cl> imarith dev$pix - 38 pix
	cl> mkobjects pix1 obj=STDIN nc=200 nl=200 back=1000 \
	>>> magzero=30 rd=10 poi+
	50 50 15.0 pix 40 1 0
	150 50 15.6 pix 30 .8 45
	50 150 16.5 pix 20 .6 90
	150 150 17.1 pix 15 .4 135
	[EOF]
.fi

It would be somewhat more efficient to first block average the
template since the oversampling in this case is very large.

The random number seed can be set from the clock time by using the value
"INDEF" to yield different random numbers for each execution.
