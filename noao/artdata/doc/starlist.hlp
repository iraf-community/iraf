DESCRIPTION
\fBStarlist\fR generates a list of x and y coordinates and magnitudes
for a sample of \fInstars\fR stars based on a user selected spatial
density function \fIspatial\fR  and luminosity function
\fIluminosity\fR and writes (appends) the results to the text file
\fIstarlist\fR. If the \fIinteractive\fR parameter is "yes" the user
can interactively examine plots of the spatial density function,
the radial density function, and the luminosity function, and alter the
parameters of the task until a satisfactory artificial field is
generated.

The spatial density function generates x and y values around a center
of symmetry defined by \fIxcenter\fR and \fIycenter\fR within the x and
y limits \fIxmin\fR, \fIxmax\fR, \fIymin\fR and \fIymax\fR according to
the spatial density function specified by \fIspatial\fR.  The three
supported spatial density functions are listed below where R is the
radial distance in pixels, P is the relative spatial density, C is a
constant and f is the best fitting cubic spline function to the spatial
density function R(user), P(user) supplied by the user in the text file
\fIsfile\fR.

.nf
    uniform:  P = C
    hubble:   P = 1.0 / (1 + R / core_radius) ** 2 + base
    file:     P = f (R(user), P(user))
.fi

The Hubble and user file spatial density function are sampled at
\fInssample\fR equally spaced points, and integrated to give the
spatial density probability function at each sampled point. The
integrated probability function is normalized and approximated by a
cubic spline of order \fIsorder\fR.  The x and y coordinates are
computed by randomly sampling the integrated probability function until
\fInstars\fR stars which satisfy the x and y coordinate limits
\fIxmin\fR, \fIxmax\fR, \fIymin\fR and \fIymax\fR are generated.

The luminosity function generates relative magnitude values between
\fIminmag\fR and \fImaxmag\fR according to the luminosity function
specified by \fIluminosity\fR.  The four supported luminosity functions
are defined below where M is the magnitude, P is the relative luminosity
function, C is a constant and f is the best fitting cubic spline
function to the luminosity function M(user), P(user) supplied by the
in the text file \fIlfile\fR.

.nf
  uniform:  P = C

  powlaw:   P = C * 10. ** (power * M)

  salpeter: P = C * 10. ** (-3.158 + 1.551e-1*dM - 5.194e-3*dM**2)

            dM = M - mzero

                             C * 10. ** (beta * dM)
  bands:   P =  --------------------------------------------------
               (1. + 10. ** ((beta-alpha)*delta*dM))) ** 1. /delta

           dM = M - mstar - mzero

  file:    P = f (M(user), P(user))
.fi

The Salpeter and "bands" functions are defined in terms of absolute
magnitudes so the parameter \fImzero\fR is used to convert from
relative magnitudes.  Equivalently, one could use absolute magnitudes
for the magnitude limits while setting the zero point to 0.

The luminosity function is sampled at \fInlsample\fR equally spaced
points, and integrated to give the luminosity probability function at
each sampled point. The probablity function is normalized and
approximated by a cubic spline of order \fIlorder\fR. The magnitudes
are computed by randomly sampling the integrated probability function
until \fInstars\fR objects which satisfy the magnitude limits
\fIminmag\fR and \fImaxmag\fR are generated.  The Salpeter luminosity
is a best fit function to the data of McCuskey (McCuskey, 1966, Vistas
Astr. 7, 141). The Bahcall and Soneira function and the default values
of the parameters are discussed by Bahcall and Soneira (Ap.J.  Supp. 44, 73).

REVISIONS

The random number seeds can be set from the clock time by using the value
"INDEF" to yield different random numbers for each execution.

BUGS
The spline approximation to the spatial density and luminosity
probability functions can  cause wiggles in the output spatial density
and luminosity functions. Users can examine the results interactively
and experiment with the spline order and number of sample points if
they are not satisfied with the results of STARLIST. The default setup
of 10 sample points per spline piece is generally satisfactory for the
spatial density and luminosity functions supplied here.
