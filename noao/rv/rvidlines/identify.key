STATUS LINE

The status line gives the pixel position, fitted wavelength, user wavelength,
wavelength residual, and optional line identification:

   pixel  fitted  user  residual [identification]

COLON COMMANDS

The parameters are listed or set with the following commands which may be
abbreviated.  To list the value of a parameter type the command alone.

:show file		Show the values of all the parameters
:features file		Write feature list to file (default is STDOUT)
:vlog file		Write velocity information to file (default is STDOUT)

:coordlist file		Coordinate list file
:cradius value		Centering radius in pixels
:threshold value	Detection threshold for feature centering
:database name		Database for recording feature records
:ftype value		Feature type (emission or absorption)
:fwidth value		Feature width in pixels
:image imagename 	Set a new image or show the current image
:labels value		Feature label type (none|index|pixel|coords|user|both)
:match value		Coordinate list matching distance
:maxfeatures value	Maximum number of features automatically found
:minsep value		Minimum separation allowed between features
:read name ap		Read a record from the database
			(name and ap default to the current spectrum)
:write name ap		Write a record to the database
			(name and ap default to the current spectrum)
:add name ap		Add features from the database
			(name and ap default to the current spectrum)
:zwidth value		Zoom width in user units

Labels:
      none - No labels
     index - Sequential numbers in order of increasing pixel position
     pixel - Pixel coordinates
    coords - User coordinates such as wavelength
      user - User labels
      both - Combination of coords and user
