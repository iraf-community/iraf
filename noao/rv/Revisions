wrtccf.x
	Fixed scaling issue with CCF output image (3/26/15)

rvrvcor.x
	Modified so UTMIDDLE now properly accepts a DATE-OBS-like
	timestamp.  Also modified so the date is properly incremented
	in the case the midpoint observation crosses midnight (7/20/10)

rvrvcor.x
	An earlier change used stridx() but was passing in a singly-quoted
	character, this caused a runtime error when checking string values
	on Sun systems.  (9/26/08)

========
V2.14.1
========

rvrvcor.x
	Changed the rv_parse_timed() procedure to permit DATE-OBS strings.
	This is used to parse the time from UT/UTMIDDLE keywords, the change
	allows these to be in DATE-OBS format rather than restrict them
	to being sexigesimal strings.  (7/25/08)

========
V2.14
========

filtpars.x
	Fixed an error in the filtpars code where missing braces meant
	that a command such as ":cutoff" would not work when filtering
	is enabled (4/6/07)

rvfgauss.x
rvfuncs.x
	Merged in old changes to include an update to do the Gaussian
	fitting using double precision.  (3/15/07)

rvwrite.x
	Increased the HJD output to 5 decimals (8/15/06)

========
V2.12.2a
========

doc/fxcor.hlp
	Added an example for setting a zero heliocentric correction for
	the template image.  (7/1/04)

=======
V2.12.2
=======

doc/fxcor.hlp
	Added an example about saving the CCF which explains how to
	save a linearized CCF for large spectra.  Also removed the
	obsolete 'time requirements' section.  (9/15/03)

wrtccf.x
	Fixed a bug in the text CCF output so it writes the velocity
	computed specifically for each point rather than the approximation
	as done before.  (9/15/03)

wrtccf.x
	Added CTYPE1='velocity' and CUNIT1='km/s' keywords to the CCF
	output image so it will display in velocity units (8/19/03)

rvrebin.x
	In very rare cases the code could overrun a stack array and 
	cause a segvio.  This array wasn't actually being used in the
	routine and so the code was removed (8/15/03)

rvidlines/idvhelio.x
	The previous change would trash the year, month, and day when
	parsing the UT.  This is fixed.  (2/6/03, Valdes)

=======
V2.12.1
=======
=====
V2.12
=====

doc/rvidlines.hlp
	Expanded on what keywords from KEYWPARS are used and how.
	(2/12/02, Valdes)

rvidlines/idvhelio.x
	The specified UT keyword is now used rather than the time given in
	the date keyword.  To use the time in the date keyword, the UT
	keyword can be set to be the same as the date keyword and the
	UT will be parsed out of the string.  So the UT keyword can be
	either a time value or a date/time string value.  This is consistent
	with changes in ASTUTIL.
	(2/12/02, Valdes)

splitplot.x
	Fixed a bug in moving the correlation X data to the plotting array
	which would sometimes cause the ccf plot to not be drawn correctly.
	(10/18/00)

rvsumplot.x
	Move the 'fit did not converge' message to a more readable location
	on the plot.  (10/18/00)

fftutil.x
        Fixed a typo that was causing the fftmode plots to be computed
        using the entire spectrum instead of taking into account the
        sample regions specified. (08/22/00)

fftmode.x
prepspec.x
splitplot.x
rvfftcorr.x
        Additional fixes to the filter overlay plotting code.  Also revealed
        a problem in the display of the FFT plots. (08/22/00)

fftmode.x
        Fixed a bug in the filter overlay plotting (8/17/00)

rvwrite.x
	Changed the output of the HJD to use modulo 10000 rather than
	constants such as 2450000.  (3/30/00)

coloncmds.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Changed the behavior of the :apnum command so that it won't reset
	the sample regions.  This was originally done to protect against
	bogus sample regions in echelle data where moving through orders
	would invalidate the regions, but harms multispec users who must
	reset the regions manually.  Updated help page (3/23/00)

=======
V2.11.3
=======

rvrvcor.x
        Fixed a bug where the DATE-OBS in the for CCYY-MM-DD wasn't checking
        for an INDEFD UT causing an overflow (12/23/99)

rvidlines/idmap.x
	The SFREE added earlier was in the wrong place causing 1D images
	to abort with a salloc underflow.  (10/12/99, Valdes)

=======
V2.11.2
=======

mkpkg
rvidlines/mkpkg
	Fixed missing/extra file dependencies  (9/20/99)

        The RVCORRECT task was a duplicate of the ASTUTIL package.  To
        avoid code confusion sources were removed from the RV package and
        the task is now defined to be the ASTUTIL version.

Revisions
rvpackage.spc
keywpars.par
rvflags.h
keywpars.x
        Files were reviewed for Y2K compliance, no changes necessary.
	(5/27/99)

keywpars.hlp
        Documentation updated about use of dtm_decode.
	(5/27/99)

rvwparam.x
        The timestamp string written for the output log header was changed
        to use a 4-digit year.  Does not affect formatting of output tables.
	(5/27/99)

rvrvcor.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
        Changed to use dtm_decode to parse date-obs field.  If a time is
	included in the date string it has precedence over UT when computing
	observation midpoint and not using UTMIDDLE keyword. (5/27/99)

Time from
        date-obs is used (if available) as the beginning time of the obs-
        ervation if there is no UT keyword present and we're not using the
        UTMIDDLE keyword to get the midpoint time.  Documentation updated.
	(5/27/99)

rvidlines/idvhelio.x
rvidlines/rvidlines.hlp
	Modified to use dtm_decode to decode both the old and new
	FITS date string.  If a time is included in the date string
	it has precedence over UT.  (5/19/99, Valdes)

rvwrite.x
	Fixed a bug in the output of the HJD to screen and txt (5/4/99)

fftutil.x
	Increased max allowable exponent from 15 to 31 (5/3/99)

rvvfit.x
        Fixed a bug in the output of deblended velocities (4/22/99)

deblend.x
	Fixed a prompt error for the 't' keystroke.  (4/8/99)

t_rvcorrect.x
    	Added code the catch a bad DATE-OBS keyword and print an informative
    	error (2/21/99)

fftmode.x
	Fixed a bug in the one-plot options. (2/21/99)

rv.hd
	Modified to remove the 'rv' definition which was interfering
	with selecting the package help (1/27/99)

rvcorrect.par
	Removed the KEYPARS pset from the parameter file.  The pset is
 	still available to the task, but it's presence interferes with
	the task when used in CL mode since the 'ut' parameter is no
	longer queried and the pset value is used, resulting in an 
	illegal number error when getting the value (4/22/98)

rvgetim.x
        When pixcorr was set the data were still being rebinned in the
        SMW code, fixed this.  (4/2/98)

splitplot.x
	Fixed a bug in the plotting of object spectrum in the summary
	plot (4/2/98)

rvcursor.x
	calls to rv_do_save() had an unused 'type' arg which conflicted
	with usage in coloncmds.x.  Since this was unused it was removed
	(3/27/98)

rvrebin.x
	rv_getim() was being used as a subroutine, should be an int
	function.   (3/27/98)

deblend.x
	Fixed a type conversion problems causing an overflow when the
	computed velocities are INDEF  (2/17/98)

rvidlines/ididentify.x
	There was a parenthesis placement error in an id_zshift call.
	(2/5/98, Valdes)

rvwrite.x
	Fixed HJD output as an offset from 2450000 for more recent dates.
	(1/5/98)

rvdrawfit.x
	Fixed a typo causing an incorrect array allocation (8/25/97)

rvplot.x
fftmode.x
rvsample.x
        Removed the checks to see if the obj/temp image names are the
        same to decide if we're making a single or split plot.  With only
        a single plot it's not possible to set different sample regions
        when autocorrelating.  (7/24/97)

fftmode.x
        Deleted unused pointers from fft_plot() routine (7/24/97)

splitplot.x
rvplot.x
rvsample.x
specmode.x
	Minor fix to plotting of sample regions (7/24/97)

fftmode.x 
splitplot.x
        Fixed a fwe minor plotting bugs for power spectra (7/7/97)

rvfgauss.x
	Changed check_converge() to rv_check_converge() to avoid name
	conflict with FITS kernel. (5/20/97)

rvidlines/idrms.x
	Modified to work in input spectrum units.  (3/13/97, Valdes)

rvgetim.x
	Input spectra which are dispersion corrected are converted to
	Angstrom units on input.  Thus the spectra can be in other
	recognized units.  (3/13/97, Valdes)

rvstrings.x
rvwrite.x
	The nam_tempcode procedure had an unnecessary pointer arg. (3/6/97)

rvwrite.x
	Added an extra space for the HJD output.  Since the JD rolled over
	245000 the number of decimal places decreased by 1, this is now
	restored (10/21/96)

contin.x
	The normalized reference spectrum was being copied from the object
	spectrum when the image names were the same as a form of optimization.
	This could fail in cases where the 'n' key was used to move through
	a list to get the next object an the object spectrum was previously
	rebinned at a different dispersion causing artificial shifts in 
	the data.  The code was modified to always compute a normalization
	to avoid this (9/12/96)

rvcorrect.par
doc/rvcorrect.hlp
	Forgot to add the keypars pset for this task  (8/26/96)

rvlinefit.x
        Removed an extraneous sfree call causing a salloc underflow if
        a certain error condition happens.  (8/13/96)

specmode.x
	Fixed a bug where the spectrum mode could get confused on future
	plots on specmode.  (8/8/96)

rvfgauss.x
        A couple of *_old varables were declared but never used.  (7/17/96)
 
rvrvcor.x
        Fixed a bug in the rv correction code where the default kpno
        observatory was always being used in cases where the image
        did not have an OBSERVAT keyword, instead of using the obs
        supplied by the task parameter  (6/26/96)

rvgetim.x
	Commented out the check for a max number of points since this
	no longer appears to be needed. (5/14/96)

rvfgauss.x
	Fixed a rare bug that can cause a floating overflow when a fit
	converges to a nonsensical large gaussian.  Added a trap for
	a very large sigma in a computed fit. (7/26/95)

rvplot.x
        Fixed an old bug in which the code to draw a single plot in
        spectrum mode was actually recursive.  This would result in an
        infinite loop if the obj/temp were the same image and the 'i'
        key was used.  Wrote code for a single plot for both the input
        and normalized single plots  (3/10/95)

=======
V2.10.4
=======

rvidlines/idvhelio.x
	Changed error action to a single warning to allow for the case
	of missing header keywords.  (10/20/94, Valdes)

rvbatch.x
        Fixed a bug where the RV_TEMPNUM wasn't being set before the 
        rv_data_check() procedure was called.  If the data were rebinned
        this corrupted the RV_TEMPVEL() pointer. (10/13/94)

=======
V2.10.3
=======

rvbatch.x
	Fixed a bug where the image wasn't being update in batch mode (7/18/94)

rvsample.x
        Fixed a bug erasing the sample regions with 'u' (5/19/94)

splitplot.x
	Fixed a bug affecting filter overlay of FFT plots. (4/24/94)

rvidlines/mkpkg
	The mkpkg was not complete in it's dependencies.  Did a mkmlist
	to insure all dependencies are checked.  (4/23/94, Valdes)

t_fxcor.x
        The imtclose() calls when shutting down would fail if the file
        lists had changed during the task.  Changed this to close the
        structure pointers instead. (2/22/94)

rvgetim.x
	Added a check on the dispersion units.
	(2/18/94, Valdes)

rvfftcorr.x
	The "prepared spectrum" plot wasn't showing the spectrum with the
	effects of the filtering.  Filtering is normally done after the 
	FFT but it made sense that the user should see the centered, apodized
	and filtered spectrum being correlated.  (2/15/94)

	Added the new tasks RVIDLINES and RVREIDLINES for determining
	velocities from spectral lines.  This task is similar to the
	IDENTIFY task for determining dispersion solutions.
	(8/24/93, Valdes)

rvinit.x
zzdebug.x
rvfgauss.x
rvdebug.par
	The type of the rvdebug.other parameter was changed but I forgot to
	update the files that were still treating this as a boolean.  Also
	removed and option for using an old version of the lorentzian fitting.
	(8/12/93)

rvcorrel.x
	Changed the computation of the antisymmetric noise function.  The
	full discussion is in the RV mail logs but basically the previous
	algorithm was computing the differences incorrectly about the peak,
	which is obvious for the case of a shift of zero.  The new algorithm
	is correct (even though the endpoints look funny).  For consistancy
	the old agorithm is still available by setting rvdebug.other to a
	positive value.  Setting rvdebug.other to -1 gets you the old alg-
	orithm with a bug fix to it.  (8/7/93)

rvanplot.x
	Added 'sigma' to the text output. (8/7/93)

rvvfit.x
	Fixed a typo in the definition of c[3] as the Sigma of the Gaussian
	fit when it's really the Sigma^2 of the fit.  It correctly used in
	the computation of width elsewhere in the code (7/9/93)

mkpkg

dispcor.x		-
dispcor.com		-
	Changed the way the data rebinning to get a common dispersion is
	handled.  Previously the V2.9 DISPCOR code was used but this ran
	into problems when trying to rebin a log spectrum to a different
	dispersion with many more points.  What happens now is that the
	original image is read but then interpolated to the requested disp-
	ersion rather than the log equivalent of what's in the header.  This
	This has the advantage that no spectrum is interpolated more than
	once prior to correlation.  (6/29/93)

mkpkg
specmode.x
rvlinefit.x		+
	Implemented a new specmode keystroke command, 'v', which is basically
	an rip-off of the SPLOT 'k' keystroke that fits a gaussian to a 
	line, asks for a standard wavelength and then computes a velocity
	for that single line.  For the moment this will be an undocumented
	command since it will be part of other enhancements to specmode
	in the next release. (5/12/93)

rvgetim.x
	The X coordinate array wasn't being initialized with the proper
	coords (5/11/93)

rvrebin.x
	The rebinned spectrum was being normalized using the entire spec-
	trum as the sample.  Any changes made interactively or samples
	selected were ignored.  This didn't make sense so I commented this
	out so the fit is done using the same samples it would in any other
	case.  (5/10/93)

rvwrite.x
	Changed the FWHM output to .txt files so it prints velocity if
	present, otherwise it's the pixel width.  The "km/s" units label
	was removed from the column heading.  (5/7/93)

rvrebin.x
	Fixed a type declaration problem causing compilation errors under
	AUX. (5/6/93)

rvwrite.x
	The "Rebined WPC" field was being printed as some bogus value
	for pixel correlation.  Changed to print INDEF.  (5/5/93)

rvcont.h
contin.x
continpars.x
	Set it up so that a :markrej command stays in effect until reset
	by another command.  Requested by Daryl.  (5/5/93)

specmode.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
lib/scr/specmode.key
	Added a new 'b' keystroke command to set the sample region for
	both spectra simultaneously.  (5/5/93)

rvwrite.x
	In the case where redshifts are being printed an INDEF value was
	being converted to a redshift before printing.  Added a bunch of
	if (IS_INDEF())s so that an INDEF redshift would be printed.
	(5/5/93)

rvrvcor.x
	Reset the RV_PRINTZ flag in the case where missing header info 
	prevented a full velocity computation.  VREL was still being con-
	verted but it was always printed as a velocity, never a redshift.
	(5/5/93)

rvsample.x
        Fixed a small problem w/ erasing sample regions. (4/30/93)

rvbatch.x
	Fixed a bug in which the .txt file header was being written before
	the final WPC was computed.  This meant that the WPC and vel-per-pixel
	values were wrong for batch runs if either spectrum had to be re-
	binned prior to the correlation.  (4/29/93)

rvrvcor.x
	The MJD was being computed incorrectly.  As defined in the Astronomical
	Almanac it's the JD - 240 0000.5.  (4/16/93)

rvvfit.x
	Fixed a bug in the output of MJD to .log files.  (4/14/93)

rvfilter.x
	Fixed a bug in the square filter code. (4/7/93)

doc/fxcor.hlp
	Added notes for the new package params.  (3/31/93)

keywpars.x
rvcomdef.h
rvkeywords.h
keywpars.par
doc/fxcor.hlp

	Made a duplicate of the RVCORRECT task for the RV package.  This
	task is identical to the one in ASTUTIL but it makes use of the
	KEYWPARS header keyword translation pset. (3/23/93)

wrtccf.x
rvpackage.h
	Fixed a bug in writing out the correlation function to an image
	or text file.  Also removed an unused RV_AXIS macro (3/15/93)

deblend.x
splitplot.x
	Fixed some INDEF type conversions that were causing problems on
	the A/UX port.  Conversion of INDEF is illegal but has only just
	now been caught because INDEFR == INDEFD on other systems (3/15/93)

rvrebin.x
rvdatacheck.x
rvfftcorr.x
    An integer zero point coordinate offset was computed and applied in
    rv_fftcorr but the fractional part was ignored.  This would produce
    a final velocity error of up to a pixel in those cases where the
    wavelength origins were not the same between the object and
    template spectra.  This error shows up in tests with DOPCOR which
    introduces just such a zero point shift.

    o	Moved the setting of w0 and npts from force_rebin to force_which.
	Force_which is now the main point for checking and resetting
	compatibility between the object and template spectral WCS.
	The key part of the fix was to adjust w0 so that it is an
	integer number of pixels shift from the w0 of the target
	spectrum.  The integer part of the shift is then handled by
	rvfftcorr.x
    
    o	The checking of the WCS in rv_data_check was moved to force_rebin
	(which then calls force_which).  Rv_data_check now simply calls
	force_rebin every time.

   o	Added a nint in rv_fftcorr to make sure that no funny roundoff
	occurs in setting integer pixel shift zero point offset.

	    ishift = nint ((RV_OW0(rv) - RV_GLOB_W1(rv)) / RV_OWPC(rv))

rv0$rv0.par
        Added an "observatory" package parameter to allow the parameter
        indirection used by the RVCORRECT task.  Until now that task
        couldn't be run.  (10/13/92)

	array was being passed.  Also fixed a typo when initializing the
	array, too many points were being moved.  (8/25/92)

rvgetim.x
	The values of RV_X1 and RV_X2 were confused w/ log and linear values
	for data w/ lambda dispersion.  (8/24/92)

splitplot.x
	Removed the sample regions markers from the prepared spectrum
	plot (8/24/92)

rvfilter.x
        There was a small "glitch" in the computed Welch or Hanning filters
        caused by an extra filter value being computed.  (8/24/92)
 
fftutil.x
	Changed some procedure arguments named 'data' to 'v' since this causes
	a compiler error on the RS/6000.  Original complaint was for
	fft_fixwrap() but as also present in fft_cosbell().  (8/13/92)

rvcursor.x
rvfgauss.x
	Cleaned up some missing sfree() calls before error returns. (8/9/92)

t_fxcor.x
rvsample.x
	Fixed a bug in the code that parses the sample parameters.  The loop
	could possibly skip past the EOS in the string, and if there is garbage
	in the buffer (as could happen when the task in the process cache) it
	could lead to incorrectly counting the number of ranges and cause a
	memory fault.  I fixed the parser bug and cleared the array before
	it was filled.  Reported by Oegerle.  (8/7/92)

rvsample.x
	Fixed a typo in which RV_ERANGE was not being freed (typo was RV_SRANGE
	in mfree).  Found w/ SPPTOOLS.  (8/5/92)

rvcursor.x
coloncmds.x
	The procedure cmd_write() was declared as an int procedure but not
	returning anything.  Caused a compiler error on DSUX Dec fortran.
	Also changed rv_query_save() in rvcursor.x since it was returning
	something but it's return value was never used.  (8/5/92)

rvrvcor.x
help/keywpars.hlp
	Fixed a typo in the explanation of the date field for DATE-OBS and
	made the error comment when it's parsed incorrectly more clear (7/31/92)

rvmwcs.x
	Updated with yet another "old-format" special case fix (7/29/92)

rvrvcor.x
	Fixed a memory leak caused by not unmapping images when there was
	an error return from rv_correct().  The task would grow in memory
	continuously until it finally ran out and died.  (7/28/92)

----------------
V2.10.1 Released

rvmwcs.x
	Updated with latest changes to onedspec$smw.x.  (5/29/92)

aplists.x
	Fixed a bug in the ordering of if-clauses that prevented a check
	against an aperture list trying to be applied to onedspec images.
	(5/29/92)

rvinit.x
t_fxcor.x
	Removed all of the stubs for reading observatory parameters from
	the image header keyword OBSERVAT.  The observatory database tools
	now used will check the image header automatically to accomplish
	the same thing.  This code was also prone to bugs since it would
	be possible to pass the wrong pointer the the obsopen procedure.
	(5/29/92)

rvinit.x
	Fixed a segvio when the obervatory parameter set to "image" (5/26/92)

rvmwcs.x
	Fixed a bug caused by the MWCS changes in which an image with no
	dispersion info a all could not be read. (5/7/92)

aplists.x
	Fixed a bug wherein the apertures would not be found since the
	verify loop looked at all the rows in an image even though that
	may be greater than the number of apertures requested.  (5/4/92)

-------------------------------
Package frozen for 2.10 release (5/2/92)

rvdatacheck.x
	Added a check to see if, when the dispersion for the two spectra
	are the same, the difference between starting wavelengths is the
	same.  If not, then we must rebin so that the difference is an
	integral of the WPC, otherwise we could end up with up to a +/- one
	pixel error.  (4/27/92)

rvsinc.x
	Fixed a bug where the sinc fit would get into an infinite loop
	if the points in the fit lay above the half power point of the
	peak.  The fix was to return fwhm=INDEF in this case. (4/22/92)

rvfitfunc.x
	The sinc fit wasn't being redrawn if no fwhm was found.  (4/22/92)

splitplot.x
	Fixed a bug with contin=none and the 't' keystroke in fft mode not
	labelling the original template correctly.  (4/20/92)

fftmode.x
splitplot.x
	Fixed a bug where the filter overlay wasn't being done correctly
	(4/20/92)

rvgetim.x
	Fixed a bug with the template being a onedspec and having a different
	aperture number than a onedspec object.  The template wasn't being
	rebinned.  (4/16/92)

fftmode.x
	Fixed a bug with the 'i' key not working on single plots (3/24/92)

rvmwcs.x
	Made change to recognize data with APFORMAT='onedspec'.
	(2/21/92, FV)

rvrvcor.x
	Modified the routine rv_correct() so it no longer uses the obsimcheck()
	procedure which was removed from xtools$obsdb.x.  Now uses obsimopen()
	(2/8/92)

rvbatch.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Changed the wincenter parameter so that it takes into account a template
	velocity if  present so the window will be centered on the expected
	velocity of the peak and not the relative velocity.  If no template
	vel is present, the peak is centered on the relative velocity as before.
	Requested by oegerle@stsci.edu  (1/16/92)

rvwrite.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Changed the format of the template code string since template names
	greater than 40 chars would trip a bug in sprintf and cause the
	write to fail with a "No write permission of file (StringFile)".
	For image names greater than 30 chars only the rightmost part of
	the string is printed.  (1/14/92)

rv.par
rvinit.x
rvflags.h
dispcor.x
rvrebin.x
rvpackage.h
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Made the rebinning interpolator a package parameter after it was
	found that the sinc interpolator had disadvantages for certain types
	of data. The default is once again poly5.  (1/10/92)

rvcorrel.x
	Added debug output to error calculations. (1/10/92)

rvsinc.x
	1) The value of the background wasn't being picked up when changed
	2) MAXITER exceeded message wasn't going through error printing
	code.  (1/10/92)

coloncmds.x
	Redo the correlation after setting a new template velocity so we
	pick it up in the results.  (1/10/92)

rvfgauss.x
	1) Silenced the convergence checking messages.
	2) Cleared arrays before input to NLFIT.  Was part of tracking a bug
	found in nlacpts() but should be done anyway.  (1/9/92)

rvfitfunc.x
	Fixed a real/double arg type error found w/ spplint.  (1/6/92)

rvpackage.h
	Removed any constraint from MAXTEMPS and set it to algorithm max of 
	702.  Need to change this is template caching if re-implemented.
	(1/6/92)

coloncmds.x
	Fixed the :tnum command to work with the new template naming scheme.
	Also fixed a small bug already there.  (1/6/92)

contin.x
getdisp.x
rvgetim.x
rvcomdef.h
continpars.x
continpars.par
doc/continpars.hlp
	Implemented a new 'replace' parameter for CONTINPARS to allow the
	rejected points to be replaced by the fit points.  Useful for re-
	moving emmission lines or cosmic ray events.  Requested by Oegerle.
	(1/3/92)

rvwrite.x
rvpackage.h
rvstrings.x
readtlist.x
	Increased the number of MAXTEMPS to 200. The algorithm codes the
	templates as A,...Z,AA,AB... so the max can be increased to almost 
	700 by changing the declaration in rvpackage.h.  Requested by Oegerle
	& Hill (1/2/92)

mkpkg
rvinit.x
rvmwcs.x 	+
rvmwcs.h	+
getdisp.x
aplists.x
rvpackage.h
	Added support for new ONEDSPEC MWCS dispersion headers.  Nonlinear
	cannot be rebinned and an error will be returned.  Other log and
	linear formats can be read.  This change should be backward compatible
	(12/31/91)

rvfgauss.x
rvfparab.x
	Changed calling sequence to nlerrors() to agree with the math$nlfit
	library calling sequence.  Was causing an error on f68881 machines.
	(10/11/91)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Package was installed in V2.10 noao package.  093091
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

rvpackage.h
	Updated package date. 091091

dispcor.x
	V210: Changed default interpolant to be II_SINC.  091091

rvwrite.x
rvwriteln.x 	-
	V210: Consolidated procedures into one logical file.  091091

rvfgauss.x
rvfparab.x
	V210: Changed NLFIT calls to be library version of single precision.
	091091

t_fxcor.x
rv0$rv0.cl
rv0$rv0.hd
rv0$rv0.par
observatory.x 	-
observatory.par -
	V210: Moved the obs_get_pars() procedure into inline code in
	rv_clpars().  Removed Observatory pset from package and use the
	NOAO observatory task instead.  091091

rvsinc.x
numrep.x
	Moved the brent() procedure to rvsinc.x since it explicitly
	calls the sinc interpolator and ther routines in numrep.x
	may be provided by an xtools file in V2.10.  090491

deblend.x
	Removed Marquardt fitting code duplicated in xtools.  090491

rvparam.x
	Reset default maxwidth to 21 as in the par file. 090391

rvfitfunc.x
	Fixed a bug that was not getting the correct points for a 'y'
	fit.  Also fixed a bug that was changing the width parameter
	and so in a list of stars it was possible to change the params
	being used without the user knowing it.  The symptom was run-
	ning a list of stars, and then randomly picking out individual
	correlations without being able to reproduce the results.  090391

complex.x
rvfilter.x
	Fixed a bug causing filter plots to be scaled incorrectly.  090291

rvbatch.x
	Made an error message printable only from interactive mode. 082991

rvfgauss.x
rvfitfunc.x
	Added some checks for a proper convergence to avoid a FOE if 
	the fit ended because of max iterations or with bogus answers.
	Fixes a bug reported by DSprayberry at UA.  082991

rvfgauss.x
	Fixed a type mismatch with the width of the fit region causing
	a FDZ in the weight fitting calc.  Only part of another problem.
	082991

coloncmds.x
	Fixed a typo in the output of dispersion info.  082091

fftutil.c
	Power spectra were computed with log(), not log10() as is used
	throughout the rest of the package.  Fixed.  082091

fftmode.x
	- Fixed another segvio as below, but for the 'g' key.
	- Fixed a bug in fft_inverse which was reporting the wrong
	  frequency with the 'i' keystroke.  071291

rvsinc.x
	Fixed a bug causing the ccf height to be computed wrongly.  071291

fftmode.x
	Fixed a segvio caused when pixcorr+ and continuum="none".  071091

coloncmds.x
	Fixed a bug caused by pixcorr+ trying to convert INDEF to an
	int when doing a ":wincenter" or ":window" call. 071091

rvwriteln.x
	Fixed a bug causing the fwhm to be output in pixels for a short
	.txt file.  070291

doc/fxcor.hlp
	Added a note that the "original" spectra are splotted on a linear
	wavelength scale and a slope may be noticed because of rebinning
	effects.  070291

rvcomdef.h
rvcolon.x
coloncmds.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
../lib/scr/fxcor.key
	Implemented a ":comment" command to add a comment to the output
	logs.  Requested by Daryl.  070191

rvfuncs.x
rvfgauss.x
rvfitfunc.x
	Changed the functional form of the Lorentzian to make it a bit
	more stable.  Previously it was the form of the normalized function
	but that didn't apply.  062891

prepspec.x
	Fixed bug with specifying decimal samples on a pixel corr.  063091

asttools/asthjd.x
asttools/asttimes.x
	Changed a constant in the JD calculation that fixes a 0.5 day
	bug on AOS systems.  Also fixed some confused parameters to the
	procedure ast_hjd().  062591

rvrvcor.x
	Added a check for the pixcorr parameter to abort a Vh calculation
	if it's not needed. 062591

fftutil.x
	Changed explicit argument dimensions to ARB.  This was causing
	a "variable dimension error" on VMS systems.  061991

rvsample.x
rvutil.x
	Fixed a problem with sample region for pixel-only correlations.
	061891

coloncmds.x
	Fixed some confusion with the ":filter" commands.  061791

rvfitfunc.x
	Changed height calculation so it's the estimate of the correlation
	value and not the height of the function.  061791

rvdrawfit.x
	Made the function erasing a bit smarter so that the FWHM indicator
	is erased the same way it was drawn.  On xterms, a line was being
	drawn across the whole screen because it didn't support graphics
	erase.  061491

fftmode.x
	Fixed two typos: One causing the 'f' keystroke to act like the
	'p' keystroke, and another causing the fft plots to be incorrectly
	calculated.  061491

rvsample.x
specmode.x
	Added some more functionality to the sample regions code, including
	a new 'u' keystroke that will automatically de-select a sample
	region.  Also, sample may now be merged or expanded by using the
	's' keystroke.  061491

prepspec.x
	Fixed a bug causing the sample regions to accidently be apodized
	for the filter plots.  061391

t_fxcor.x
rvcursor.x
coloncmds.x
	Added some checks so that the filter parameter cannot be changed
	(specifically, turned on) before filter values have been set.
	Previously the task would get in a confused state because the
	data check prior to the correlation would fail and there was no
	recovery.  061191

t_fxcor.x
splitplot.x 
rvsample.[xh]
	Added code so that samples specified as pixels will still be plotted
	if dispersion info is present and the user hasn't requested a
	pixel-only correlation.  061191

splitplot.x
	Fixed a samples ranges plotting bug on summary plots.  061191

------------------------------
Package updated on local systems for testing.  060591

wxcor.h
rvwriteln.x
	Added the rebin parameter to the output codes. 060591

readtlist.x
rvimutil..x
	Optimized a bit to remove extra rv_getim() calls that were only
	used to get template velocities.  060491

rvfitfunc.x
rvfftcorr.x
	Fixed a memory bug being tripped up when images with differing
	sizes are passed in the list.  Also made sure correlation array
	is big enough after the rebinning, previously is could have been
	off by a few elements.  060491

rvflags.h
fxcor.par
t_fxcor.x
rvcolon.x
rvparam.x
rvcomdef.h
rvpackage.h
rvstrings.x
coloncmds.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
rv0$lib/scr/fxcor.key
	Implemented a new "rebin" parameter to give user control over 
	which spectrum is rebinned.  060391

rvwriteln.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Added output of rebinned dispersion to logs when it differs from
	previous so user can be aware of rebinning changes.  Since data
	are always rebinned to the lowest dispersion, log entries should
	be minimized although interpolation errors may increase.  The help
	page was also modified to alert useras to this fact.  060291

contin.x
rvplot.x
fftmode.x
rvrebin.x
specmode.x
readtlist.x
	Fixed usages of RV_(R)NPTS macros so the are consistent with the
	spectra used.  Since relaxing the constraint that the rebinned npts
	match we need to make sure both object and templates are allowed to
	be arbitrary lengths, and that code know what the lengths should
	be.  060291

rvsinc.x
numrep.x
rvflags.h
rvfgauss.x
rvfparab.x
rv0$rv0.par
rvpackage.h
	Made fitting tolerances and max iterations a package param.  053091

rv0$rv0.par
rvpackage.h
rvrvcor.x
	Made the z_threshold a package parameter so that users have control
	over the threshold at which output is printed as redshift z values
	rather than velocities.  052391

rvinit.x
rvplot.x
rvutil.x

rvsample.x    +
specmode.x
rvpackage.h
coloncmds.x
rvfftcorr.x
rvsumplot.x
splitplot.x
rvdatacheck.x
	Implemented multiple and independent sample regions.  This involved
	the addition of a new structure containing the ranges information.
	This structure can be accessed directly by referencing the struct
	pointer, or the structure for either object or template can be
	accessed with the main rv struct pointer by using macros.  Work
	routines are passed only the sample struct pointer and calling
	routines figure out which spectra the sample applies to and pass in
	the appropriate pointer.  052191-052391

rvutil.x
rvcursor.x
specmode.x
	Fixed a GIO wcs bug causing endpoint marking keystrokes to get 
	confused.  052091

fxcor.par
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Changed default maxwidth to 21.  051891

rvsinc.x   +
rvvfit.x
rvplot.x
rvflags.h
fxcor.par
rvdrawfit.x
rvstrings.x 
rvfitfunc.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
	Began implementation of a sinc interpolator and Brent peak finding 
	algorithm.  051791

rvbatch.x
	Fixed bug that was turning off object continuum subtraction. 051791

rvutil.x
	Fixed a small bug with using the 's' to specify a sample.  Range
	was being checked against the log of the wavelength causing the
	range to be e.g. 3.09-5400.   051691

rvgetim.x
rvrebin.x
splitplot.x
	Fixed rebinning bug causing spectra to somtimes be truncated if
	the difference in dispersion was great enough.  That is, the
	number of data points was being fixed rather than being allowed
	to vary so that the same wavelength region was covered.  In the
	process I also fixed a small plotting bug for spectrum plots.  051691

rvsumplot.x
rvfitfunc.x
	Fixed drawing of FWHM indicator for parabolic fits.  This was
	reported as a bug but in fact the indicator was never drawn.
	Since we want the FWHM to be computed from the coefficients and
	not an empirical calculation, this is the way it is drawn although
	it looks like it is underestimated.  051491

rvcolon.x
specmode.x
rvcomdef.h
coloncmds.x
rv0$lib/scr/fxcor.key
rv0$src/doc/fxcor.hlp
	Changed the ":wpc" command to be ":disp" so it prints out all
	dispersion information.  051491

rvcolon.x
rvcomdef.h
coloncmds.x
rv0$lib/scr/fxcor.key
rv0$src/doc/fxcor.hlp
	Implemented a ":printz" command to toggle redshift output.  051491

rvbatch.x
	Added more bounds checking to window computation.  If a window was
	set too large or the center was outside the ccf bounds, a segvio
	would occur.  051491

aplists.x
	Fixed bug with onedspec images returning an ERR apnum.  051491

wxcor.h
rvflags.h
rvpackage.h
rvwriteln.x
	Implemented output of redshift z values when relative velocity
	exceeds a threshold (set at 0.2).  (User request)  051491

rvvfit.x
rvbatch.x
rvparam.x
rvwrite.x
t_fxcor.x
rverrmsg.x
coloncmds.x
rvwriteln.x
rvstrings.x
	Implemented the "verbose" parameter as an enumerated string to
	suppress metacode or log files (User request).  051391

deblend.x 
dispcor.x 
getdisp.x 
rvparam.x 
rvrebin.x
continpars.x 
	Cleanup up some more type inconsistencies found by SPPLINT.  051391

rvgetim.x
	Fixed typo causing template aperture to be incorrectly printed
	in logs if only 1-D.  051291

rvimutil.x
	Fixed bug so that aperture lists are updated for each new image.
	If aperture="*" and the apertures in the image varies, the original
	last was always being used causing an "Aperture out of range"
	message.  051291

rvdrawfit.x
	Changed line type of fitted function to be dashed so it's dis-
	tinquished from the ccf (user request).  051091 

rvcorrel.x
	Removed an extra factor of 2 from the computation of the anti-
	symmetric noise component in rv_antisym().  This was causing
	an incorrect value of the T&D R to be computed.  050191

rvkeywords.h
	Changed size of the 'struct' to be 16.  This clears up a memory bug
	that has been present in the system since dirt but has only recently
	made my life miserable.  051091

fxcor.par
	Changed boolean parameters declared as quoted "yes"/"no" to be
	true boolean values yes/no.  050991

wrtccf.x
rvplot.x
aplists.x
rvparam.x
fftmode.x
rvparam.x
zzdebug.x
rvimutil.x
specmode.x
filtpars.x
coloncmds.x
rvdrawfit.x
continpars.x
	Fixed some argument type mismatches and number of arguments.  This
	may have been the cause of the long-time "Salloc Undeflow" error.
	All of these were caught using the public domain "f2c" program
	in combination with UNIX "lint" on the resulting C code.  050291

rvinit.x
	Fixed typo indentation which was making the logic look different
	than it actually was.  042991

rvgetim.x
	Returned from rv_ap2line() after determining format was ONEDSPEC
	rather than continue to parse APNUM keywords which may be different
	values.  042991

rvbatch.x
	Fixed bug causing template velocities to be confused in batch
	mode with a template list.  042691

wxcor.h
	Straightened out alignment of HGHT and VFWHM columns.  042591

rvdrawfit.x
	Fixed bug causing fitting function and ccf to not be drawn in
	batch mode.  042591

rvpackage.h
rvdrawfit.x
rvcursor.x
	Added code to avoid the 'erasing' of a possible residual plot when
	refitting a peak.  On xterm windows this shows up as a draw and
	further messes up the plot.  042191

rvrvcor.x
	Removed calculation and reset of "verror" from the procedure.  The
	actual error from the T&D computations is done in the fitting
	routines always called prior to the rv_rvcorrect() procedure and this
	was just trashing a correct error.  By deleting the reset of 
	verror = INDEF, we retain a velocity error estimate for the relative 
	vel when a full heliocentric correction can't be computed.  042291

fftmode.x
specmode.x
rvxcomdef.h
coloncmds.x
	Added output for ":wpc" command to print rebinned wpc.  042191

splitplot.x
	Fixed typo preventing points in summary plot ccf being plotted. 042191

/arc/ftp/iraf.old/rv0.tar.Z
	Fixed RV_VREL bug in archive since support for high redshift work is
	lacking and it seemed like an important fix (a 'no-no'). 4/17 22:23

doc/continpars.hlp
	Added a note on where to look for syntax of "c_sample".  040491

doc/fxcor.hlp
	Changed wording of rebinning order to reflect implementation. 040491

rvrvcor.x
	Changed argument to rv_shift2vel() so shift is real and not double.
	This was causing incorrect VREL values to be printed.  040491

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Package frozen and archived for Beta Release.  040191
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

fftmode.x
rvcolon.x
rvfilter.x
specmode.x

contin.x
rvbatch.x
rvgetim.x
rvrebin.x
rvcursor.x
coloncmds.x
readtlist.x
	Changed calls to do_continuum() so they pass int flags rather than
	a character in order to avoid confusion and problems with chars/int
	getting confused.  031991

rvbatch.x
	Fixed bug in window params when center is specified.  031991

rvbatch.x
	Fixed duplicate continuum subtraction being done in batch mode.  031591

rvplot.x
	Fixed min/max compiler bug under VMS.  031491

fftmode.x
specmode.x
	Fixed bug with the stridx() function having an int argument when a
	char is requested.  Since the integer*4 keystroke gets passed into
	a integer*2 argument, the info in the high two bytes is lost.  031491

rv0$lib/scr/fftmode.key
	Added to 'o' and 't' commands to menu.  031491

rvbatch.x
coloncmds.x
contin.x
	Removed 'b' option to do_continuum(), and removed salloc declarations
	in continuum() since there was no sfree and they weren't being used
	anyway.  031391

rvdatacheck.x
splitplot.x
	Fixed mixed-type arguments to min/max causing problems on the
	VMS 5.4 compilers.  031291

rvutil.x
rvflags.h
	Removed disp() function.  Also fixed a bug in the rv_shiftspec()
	procedure causing bad approximations for large redshifts in the
	'd' keystroke in specmode.  031291

rvvfit.x
	Expanded output on .log file to 24 chars for image names.  Added
	note to docs saying image names may be truncated.  031191

getdisp.x
	Saved data format for later use in output log.  031191

specmode.x
	Added 'd' keystroke to not be remembered from SPECMODE.  Fixed
	bug with 'q' key being remembered.  031191

rvplot.x
rvutil.x
rvvfit.x
wrtccf.x
rvbatch.x
rvrvcor.x
rvsumplot.x
coloncmds.x
rvdrawfit.x
rvwriteln.x
splitplot.x
	Made the calculation of the relative velocity uniform throughout
	the code.  The relativistic (1+z) form is now used since things
	like plot scales and so on were slightly off at high redshift.
	Talked w/ Silva baout this and he agrees.  030891

splitplot.x
	Changed calculation of plot velocity scaling so it agrees w/ cursor
	readout at high redshifts.  This was previously done as shift*deltav
	which is only an approximation.  030791

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Updated noao systems with latest version prior to final release.  030791
------------------------------------------------------------------------

rv0$rv0.cl
	Expanded min_lenuserarea to 40000 to avoid problems encountered
	by John Hill with large 2-D images.  Code taken from nessie$nessie.cl
	script.  030491

wxcor.h
rvwrite.x
rvwparam.x
rvwriteln.x
	Added height to output and reorganized fields.  030291

rvwrite.x
specmode.x
coloncmds.x
rvwriteln.x
	Changed output of sample regions so it's only written to logs
	when the results are written.  030191

coloncmds.x
	Fixed bug with ":output" not working.  030191

rvcursor.x
splitplot.x
coloncmds.x
doc/fxcor.hlp
rv0$lib/scr/fxcor.key
	Implemented ymin/ymax commands to set ccf plot scaling. 030191

rvinit.x
	Fixed typo initializing RV_WINR.  Added y1,y2 inits.  030191

rvfitfunc.x
	Added checks to the center1d fit to see if it returns an INDEF
	shift.  A user reported floating overflows, which was tracked to
	the threshold level being set too high for his data.  022891

rvplot.x
	Fixed bug with 'z' not working on pixel-correlation plots.  022291

rv0$lib/scr/fxcor.key
doc/fxcor.hlp
rvcursor.x, splitplot.x
	Changed 'c' keystroke to be a cursor readout to help solve the problem
	of users trying to use 'C' to get cursor position.  Also added note in
	the help page that 'C' is not recommended because of confused GIO w/
	multiple WCSs. Renamed 'c' to 'm'.  022291

titles.x
	Removed fplot_title() and pplot_title() - not used.  022291

specmode.x
	Fixed bug causing 's' to be recognized as a 'sample' command when
	specmode was entered the 1st time and the last key was a sample sel-
	ection.  Leaving specmode and re-entering with 's' from ccf mode
	caused odd behavior.  Only occured with continuum=none.  021591

rv0$src/doc/fxcor.hlp, rv0$lib/scr/fxcor.key
rvpackage.h, rvcomdef.h t_fxcor.x, getdisp.x, aplists.x, coloncmds.x
	Added a new parameter "pixcorr" which controls whether or not the
	dispersion info in the header is used to rebin the data.  If set to
	'y', then data are not rebinned and no velocities may be computed.
	021591

coloncmds.x
	Fixed typo causing ":contin" to no take new value.  021591

splitplot.x
	Fixed bug causing the top FFT plot to be incorrectly scaled. 021391

rvvfit.x
	Fixed output of vel error when no dispersion info present.  020891

rvdatacheck.x
	Added check for dispersion info when calculating deltav.  020891

getdisp.x
	Added code to get CD_1 if CDELT1 not present, and made sure that
	w0/wpc are not uninitialized.  020891

rvranges.x
	Fixed bug that prevented range strings from being properly decoded.
	The parsing loop wasn't being executed and the rangecount flag was
	never reset from ALL_SPECTRUM.  020891

rvranges.x
rvdatacheck.x
	Added more checks for rangecount and dc-flag values so regions would
	be interpreted inthe right units.  020891

specmode.x
	Fixed duplicate greactivate() call for ":show".  020891
