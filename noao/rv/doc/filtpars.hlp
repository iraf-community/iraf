USAGE 
filtpars

PARAMETERS
.ls f_type = "ramp"
Type of filter to be used.  Possible choices are
.ls ramp
A ramp function which begins to rise at the \fIcuton\fR wavenumber and
reaches full value (i.e. passes the full value of the component) at the
\fIfullon\fR wavenumber.  It begin to decline at the \fIcutoff\fR wavenumber
and returns to zero at the \fIfulloff\fR wavenumber.
.le
.ls Hanning
A Hanning function is used to attenuate the fourier components over the
range specified by the \fIcuton\fR and \fIcutoff\fR parameters.
.le
.ls Welch
A Welch function is used to attenuate the fourier components over the range
specified by the \fIcuton\fR and \fIcutoff\fR parameters.
.le
.ls Square
A standard step function which is zero outside the \fIcuton\fR and
\fIcutoff\fR component numbers and one within those numbers.
.le
.le
.ls cuton = 0
The fourier wavenumber at which the filter begins to pass the filtered fft
component.
.le
.ls cutoff = 0
The fourier wavenumber at which the filter ceases to pass fft components.
.le
.ls fullon = 0
Used only for a 'ramp' filter.  The fourier wavenumber at which the filter
reaches full value and passes all of the data.
.le
.ls fulloff = 0
Used only for a 'ramp' filter.  The fourier wavenumber at which the filter
reaches zero value and passes none of the data.
.le

DESCRIPTION 
The filtering parameters control the type of filter to be used
on the Fourier transformed data as well as the range in wavenumbers over
which it will operate.  Filtering of the data may be necessary to remove
high frequency noise or low-frequency tends not removed by continuum
subtraction.  If the filtering is enabled, then once the data have been 
transformed, a bandpass filter of the type chosen by the
\fIf_type\fR parameter is applied to the Fourier components of the
spectra.  Wavenumbers lower than that specified by the \fIcuton\fR parameter
are set to zero and wavenumbers up to that specified by the \fIcutoff\fR
parameter (or the \fIfulloff\fR parameter in the case of a 'ramp' filter)
are attenuated or passed in full according to the filter chosen.   
Since the data are assumed to be linearized in log-wavelength space, applying 
a filter to the data in Fourier space introduces no phase shift and has 
the same effect as smoothing the data in real space.  The data are centered 
and zero padded in an array of length 2**N such that the number of elements 
is greater than or equal to the number of actual data points.  This array in
then Fourier transformed, and the resulting fft is then filtered prior
to correlation.

Filtering is enabled by turning on the \fIfxcor.filter\fR parameter and setting
it to something other than "none".  Filtering may be done on only one of the
two spectra or both prior to correlation.

The filter choices behave as follows:
.ls Square Filter
The fourier components at wavenumbers between the \fIcuton\fR and \fIcutoff\fR
wavenumbers are passed without change.  Those wavenumbers outside this region
are set to zero.
.le
.ls Ramp Filter
Fourier components below the \fIcuton\fR and above the \fIfulloff\fR 
wavenumbers are set to zero. 
At the \fIcuton\fR wavenumber the filter function
begins to rise until the \fIfullon\fR wavenumber is reached.  Data in this 
region is weighted by the slope of the filter until at the \fIfullon\fR
wavenumber data are passed through without change.  Similarly, the filter
begins to fall at the \fIcutoff\fR wavenumber until it completely blocks
(i.e. zeros) the fourier components at the \fIfulloff\fR wavenumber.
.le
.ls Welch Filter
Fourier components below the \fIcuton\fR and above the \fIcutoff\fR 
wavenumbers are set to zero.  Components between these regions are weighted
according to the equation for a Welch window.  Namely,

.nf 
						     2      
	w(j)  = 1. - [ (j - 1/2(N-1)) / (1/2(N+1)) ] 
		        
		where j =  (wavenumber - cuton_wavenumber) 
	      	      N =  (cutoff - cuton) + 1
.fi
.le
.ls Hanning Filter
Fourier components below the \fIcuton\fR and above the \fIcutoff\fR 
wavenumbers are set to zero. Components between these regions are weighted
according to the equation for a Hanning window.  Namely,

.nf
	w(j)  =  1/2 [ 1. - cos( (TWOPI*j) / (N-1) ) ]

		where j =  (wavenumber - cuton_wavenumber) 
	              N =  (cutoff - cuton) + 1

TASK COLON COMMANDS
The values of the \fIfiltpars\fR pset may be changed, displayed, or updated
from within the Fourier mode of the \fIfxcor\fR task.  Simply 
typing the parameter name will have the default action of printing the current
value of that parameter. An optional value may be added to change the named
parameter.
.ls :update  filtpars
Update the pset with the current values of the filter parameters.
The argument "filtpars" must be present or else the command will default
to the task parameters.
.le
.ls :unlearn  filtpars
Reset the parameter values to their defaults.
The argument "filtpars" must be present or else the command will default
to the task parameters.
.le
.ls :show  filtpars
Clear the screen and display all values in the filtpars pset.
The argument "filtpars" must be present or else the command will default
to the task default.
.le
.ls :filttype	[ramp|welch|hanning|square|none]
Set or show the current value of the filter type to use
.le
.ls :cuton	[int_value]
Set or show the current value of the cuton fourier component
.le
.ls :cutoff	[int_value]
Set or show the current value of the cutoff fourier component
.le
.ls :fullon	[int_value]
Set or show the current value of the fullon fourier component
.le
.ls :fulloff	[int_value]
Set or show the current value of the fulloff fourier component
