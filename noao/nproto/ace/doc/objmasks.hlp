NAME
objmasks -- detect objects in images and create masks and sky maps
.ih
SYNOPSIS
.ih
USAGE	
objmasks images objmasks skys
.ih
PARAMETERS
.ls images
List of images or multiextension files for which object masks are desired.
.le
.ls objmasks
List of object masks to be created.  This list must match the input list.
Multiextension input files will produce multiextension mask files.  If the
input image is writable, the name of the created mask will recorded in the
image header.  Note that it is possible to specify a null image to
not produce an output mask.  This might be done if the background sky
or sky sigma maps are desired or to just see the log information.
.le

.ls omtype = "numbers" (boolean|numbers|colors|all)
The type of encoding for the object mask values.  In all cases non-object pixels
(that is background) have mask values of zero.  The choices for the mask
values are "boolean", "numbers", "colors", and "all".  These are described
in the \fIOutput Data\fR section.
.le
.ls skys = "", sigmas = ""
Optional lists of input or output sky and sigma maps.  Maps are either
constant values or images which are interpolated to the size of the input
images.  If a list is given it must match the input \fIimages\fR list.
If constant values or existing maps are specified then those are used
without change.  If a new filename is given then an output file is created
with the values computed by the task.  Multiextension input images create
or apply the same extension names to the specified sky or sigma files.
Constant input values apply to all extensions.  The sigma values are
per single input image pixel.
.le
.ls masks = "!BPM"
List of bad pixel masks for the input images.  Non-zero masks values are
ignored in the object detection and are passed on to the output object
masks based on the \fIomtype\fR parameter.  An empty list applies no bad
pixel mask, a single mask applies to all input images, and a matching
list matches the masks with the input image.  A mask is specified by a
filename or by reference to a filename given by the value of a header
keyword in the input image.  A header keyword reference is made with the
syntax "!<keyword>" where <keyword> is the desired keyword with case
ignored.  For multiextension files the input masks may be either a
multiextension file with matching extension names or a directory of
pixel list files with the extension names as filenames.
.le
.ls extnames = ""
Extensions to select from multiextension files.  A null string matches all
extension names.  Otherwise the parameter is a comma separated list of
patterns that match the entire extension name.  Thus, an explicit list of
extension names may be specified or the pattern matching characters '?' for
any character or '[]' for a set of characters may be used.  The set may
include ranges in ascii order by using hyphens; i.e. 1-3 matches the
characters 1, 2, and 3.
.le
.ls logfiles = "STDOUT"
List of output log files.  If no list is given then no output log information
will be produced.  If only one file is specified it applies to all input
images otherwise the list of files must match the images list.  Note that
the special name "STDOUT" corresponds to terminal output.
.le

.ls blkstep = 1
The mean and sigma of the background or sky pixels are determined in a
first pass through the image.  If \fIblkstep\fR is one all lines are used.
To skip lines in order to speed up this computation, the parameter may be
set to a larger value to define the increment between lines.  However, the
task will enforce a preset minimum number to insure a sufficient sample.
.le
.ls blksize = -10
The background mean sky and sky sigma are determined in a set of square
blocks from which the values are linearly interpolated to each point in the
input image.  The size of the blocks may be specified as a number of blocks
spanning the smaller image dimension by using a negative integer value.
Or the size may be specified as the number of pixels across a block.
The task will enforce a preset minimum number of pixels per block which may
require using bigger blocks than specified.  The background determination
algorithm is described further in the "Background Determination" section.
.le

.ls convolve = "block 3 3"
Convolution filter to be applied prior to threshold detection.  The
convolution filter is defined by a set of weights in a 2D array.  These
may be specified in files or with certain forms given by special strings.
The options are described in the "Convolution Filter" section.
.le
.ls hsigma = 3., lsigma = 10.
Object pixels are identified by sigma thresholds about the mean background
based on the estimated background sigma at each point in the image.
The sigma factors are specified in terms of the "per pixel" sigma before
convolution.  The \fIhsigma\fR value is the "high" or above background
limit and the \fIlsigma\fR value is the "low" or below background limit.
Typically detections are one-sided, such as detecting objects above
the background, and so the thresholds need not be equal.
.le
.ls hdetect = yes, ldetect = no
Identify objects as pixels which are above the background (\fIhdetect\fR)
and below the background (\fIldetect\fR)?  If objects are detected but the
corresponding parameter is no then the output mask will not include those
objects.
.le
.ls neighbors = "8" (8|4)
The threshold selected pixels are associated with other neighboring pixels to
form an object.  The criterion for a neighbor being part of the
same object is defined by this parameter.  The choices are "8" for
pixels touching in any of the 8 directions or "4" to identify neighbors
as only horizontal or vertically adjacent.
.le
.ls minpix = 6
The minimum number of neighboring pixels which define an acceptable object.
.le
.ls ngrow = 2, agrow = 2.
After an object is identified as a set of threshold detected pixels,
additional neighboring pixels may be added to the object.  This allows
expanding the object into the faint wings of the light distribution.  The
additional pixels are those which touch the boundary pixels.  Pixels are
added in multiple passes, each time extending the previous boundary.  The
parameter \fIngrow\fR (an integer value) defines the maximum number of
boundary extensions.  The parameter \fIagrow\fR (a real value) specifies
the maximum increase in area (number of pixels) from the original
detection.
.le

DESCRIPTION
\fBOBJMASKS\fR is a task for creating masks covering objects in images.
An optional secondary product of this task is to produce background
and sigma maps.  Objects are identified by threshold sigma detection.
These object masks may be used by other applications to exclude the object
data or focus on the objects.  The detection consists of determining a
smooth, spatially variable mean background and background sigma (if no
input maps are provided), convolving the data by an optional filter to
optimize detection of faint sources, collecting pixels satisfying the
detection thresholds, assigning neighboring pixels to a common object,
applying a minimum number of pixels test to the objects, and growing
objects to extend into the wings of the object light distribution.
The last step is writing out the identified object pixels as a mask.

1. Input Data

The input data consists of one or more 2D images.  The images are assumed
to  contain a moderately smooth background and multiple sources or
objects.  This task is most useful for images with large numbers of small
sources rather than one large object such as a nearby galaxy.  The input
images, specified by the \fIimages\fR parameter, may be individual images
(which includes images selected from multiextension files as explicit
image extensions) or multiextension files specified by a root filename.  In
the latter case the image extension names selected by the \fIextnames\fR
parameter are used.

Background means and sigmas (specified per image pixels) may be specified
by "maps".  These may be constant numerical values or images.  The map
images will be linearly interpolated to the size of the input images.
For multi-extension input data, constant map values apply to all extensions
and maps are also multiextension files with map images having the same
extension names.

Bad pixel masks may be associated with the input images to
exclude pixels from the background and object determinations.  These
bad pixels are also included in the output object masks.  The bad pixel
masks are specified by the \fImasks\fR parameter.  This parameter may
identify a mask by a filename or a keyword.  A single mask may be
specified to apply to all images or a matching list of masks may be
given.

The masks are in one of the supported mask formats.  As of IRAF V2.12 this
includes pixel list (.pl) files and FITS "type=mask" extensions.  When the
input files are multiextension files, the selected extension names are
appended to the specified mask filename to select masks with the same
extension name.  If a mask file of the form "name[ext]" is not found
the task will treat the filename as a directory of pixel list files and
select the pixel list file with the extension name; i.e. "name/ext.pl".

2. Output Data

The output of this task are object masks, sky maps, sigma maps, and log
information.  The output object masks default to mask type extensions.  If an
extension name is not specified explicitly the default extension name
"pl" is created.  To select a pixel list output format an explicit ".pl"
extension must be used.

When the input data are multiextension files, the output masks, mean sky
maps, and sky sigma maps will be multiextension files with the specified
rootnames and the same extension name as the input.

The output mask values identify non-object pixels with zero.  The non-zero
values are encoded as selected by the \fIomtype\fR parameter.  The choices
are:

.ls "boolean"
All object and bad pixels have a mask value of one; i.e. the output masks
consists only of the values 0 and 1.
.le
.ls "numbers"
Input bad pixels values between 1 and 10 preserve their value and all
other input mask values are mapped to 10.  The object mask pixels have
object numbers starting with 11.  The object numbers are assigned by
the task (roughly in order from the first line to the last line) and
all pixels from a single object have the same unique object number.
.le
.ls "colors"
Input bad pixels are mapped to output values of one.  The object numbers
are modulo 8 plus 2; i.e. values between 2 and 9.  The purpose of this
numbering is to allow mapping to the nine standard display colors for an
interesting overlay with the \fBdisplay\fR task and "ocolors='+203'".
.le
.ls "all"
This is the same as "numbers" except that bits 24 to 27 in the mask values
are used for various purposes.  In particular bit 24 is set for the boundary
pixels.  This numbering will be used in the future by special tasks.
.le

Output mean sky and sky sigma maps consist of the mean and sigma values
in blocks as described in the "Background Determination" section.
Therefore, the size of the map images are smaller than the input data images.
These maps need to be interpolated to the size of the input image
to obtain the values used for particular pixels in the data images.
This interpolation expansion is done automatically by some tasks such
as \fBmscred.rmfringe\fR.

The log output provides information about the files, the phase of the
processing, some of the parameters, and the convolution filter weights.
The output begins with the task identifier ACE.  This is because this
prototype task is a first release piece of a major package called ACE
(Astronomical Cataloging Environment), which is under development.

3. Background Determination

Detection of sources in an image begins with determining the background.
By this we mean estimating the probability distribution of the background
pixel values at every pixel in the image.  In practice we only estimate
the central value and width and assume a normal distribution for evaluating
the significance of deviations from the central value.  Since we normally
won't have a sample of values at each pixel the distribution is
determined from a sample of nearby pixels.

In this discussion the central value of a distribution is denoted by <I>.
It is estimated by the mean or mode of the sample.  The width of the
distribution about <I> is denoted by <S> and is estimated by the absolute
mean residual converted to the standard deviation of a normal distribution
with the same absolute mean residual.  The normal deviation of a value I
from the distribution is defined as R = (I - <I>) / <S>.

The background may be specified by input maps for one or both of the
background quantities.  The maps may be constant values which apply
to all pixels or a grid of values given in an image which are linearly
interpolated to the full size of the input data.  For those quantities
which are not input the following algorithm is used for computing
a map.  The maps may be output and used as a product of this task.

The background and/or sigma are estimated in two initial passes through the
data.  The first pass algorithm fits linear functions to a subsample of
lines using sigma clipping iteration to eliminate objects.  The subsample
is used to speed up the algorithm and is reasonable since only linear
functions are used.  Each sample line is block averaged in blocks of 10
pixels and a linear function is fit by least squares to obtain an estimate
for <I> along the line.  The fitting weights are the number of good pixels
in each block average after elimination of bad pixels specified by the
user in a bad pixel mask.  The absolute values of the residuals are also
fit to produce a constant function for <S>.

To exclude objects from affecting these estimates the fitting is iterated
using sigma clipping rejection on the normal deviations R.  In the
first iteration the fitting function for <S> is a constant and in
subsequent steps a linear fit is used.  When the sigma clipping iteration
rejects no more data, the remaining block averages, absolute residuals, and
weights are used to fit a 2D plane for both <I> and <S>.  The <S> surface
is a constant in order to avoid potential negative sigma values.

This first pass algorithm is fast and produces good estimates for the
planar approximation to the background.  The second pass divides the image
into large, equal sized blocks, as specified by the \fIblksize\fR
parameter, and estimates <I> and <S> in each block.  The size of the blocks
needs to be large enough to give good estimates of the statistics though
small enough to handle the scale of variations in the sky.  Each block is
divided into four subblocks for independent estimates which are then
combined into a final value for the block.  As with the first pass, the
second pass can be speeded up by using a subsample of lines (parameter
\fBblkstep\fR) provided some minimum number of lines per subblock is
maintained.

The background estimates in each subblock are made using histograms of the
normal deviations R computed relative to the first pass estimates of <I>
and <S>.  When pixels are added into the histogram the <I> and <S> used to
compute R are accumulated into means of these quantities in order
to convert estimates from the normalized deviation histogram back into data
values.  The histograms are truncated at +/-2.5 and have bin widths
determined by requiring a specified average bin population based on the
number of pixels in the block.  Typically the bin population is of order
500.  The histogram truncation is essentially an object-background
discrimination.

When all the pixels in a subblock have been accumulated, new estimates of
<I> and <S> are computed.  If the number of pixels in the histogram is
less than two-thirds of the subblock pixels the estimates are set to be
indefinite.  This flags the subblock as too contaminated by objects to be
used.  All subblock neighbors, which may cross the full block boundaries,
are also rejected to minimize contamination by the wings of big galaxies
and very bright stars.

If the histogram has enough pixels, the bin populations are squared to
emphasize the peak of the distribution and reduce the effects of the
truncated edges of the histogram.  Because of noise and the fine binning of
the histogram, a simple mode cannot be used and squaring the bin numbers
helps to approach the mode with a centroid.  Squaring the bin values and
then computing the centroid can also be thought of as a weighted centroid.

Generally a mode is considered the best estimate to use for the central
value <I> of the sky distribution.  But it is unclear how to best estimate
the mode without an infinite number of pixels.  One could do something like
fit a parabola to the histogram peak.  But instead we use the empirical
relation for a skewed distribution between the mean, mode, and median;
<I>=mean-3*(mean-median).  The mean is the weighted centroid and the median
is obtained numerically from the histogram using linear interpolation to
get a subbin value.

The <S> values are obtained from the absolute mean residual of the
unweighted histogram about the previously derived central value <I> of the
histogram.  The conversion to a standard deviation is made by computing the
ratio between the standard deviation and mean absolute deviation of a
Gaussian distribution.  The standard value over the entire distribution
cannot be used because the histogram is truncated.  However, it is easy to
numerically compute the ratio with the same truncation.

Once <I> and <S> are obtained in bin numbers it is converted to data
values by using the mean and sigma of the input pixel values used
to create the histogram.

The averages of the subblock <I> and <S> values which are not indeterminate
in each block are computed.  If any of the full blocks are indeterminate
when all the subblocks have been eliminated as contaminated, values are
obtained for them by interpolation from nearby blocks.  The block values
are then linearly interpolated to get background values for every
pixel in the input image.

Note that the background pixels used in the block algorithm before
detection are derived by simple sigma clipping of the histogram values
around the planar background.  If an output map for either the mean
values or the sigmas is specified then during the object detection stage
the background and sigmas are updated using the detected sky pixels about
the initial block sampled background.  This is a more sensitive selection
of sky pixels since convolution filtering can exclude pixels from faint
objects and the wings of all objects.  The new set of sky pixels are
accumulated and used in the same way as described earlier.

4. Convolution Filters

In order to improve the detection of faint sources dominated by the
background noise, the input data may be convolved to produce filtered
values in which the noise has been suppressed.  The threshold detection
is then performed on the filtered data values.

The convolution detection filter is specified with the \fIconvolve\fR
parameter.  There is only one convolution that can be specified and it
applies to all input images in a list.  If a null string ("") is specified
then no convolution is performed.  The task has been optimizations for this
case to avoid treating this as a 1x1 convolution and to avoid extra memory
allocations required when a convolution is done.

The convolved value at pixel (i,j), denoted I'(i,j), is defined by

.nf
    I'(i,j) = sum_kl{I(m,n)*W(k,l)} / sum_kl{W(k,l)}
.fi

where I(m,n) is the unconvolved value at pixel (m,n), W(k,l) are the NX x
NY (both must be odd) convolution weights, sum_kl is the double sum over k
and l, and

.nf
    m' = i + k - (NX+1)/2	for k = 1 to NX
    n' = j + l - (NY+1)/2	for l = 1 to NY

    m = m' (1<=m'<=C)	m = 1-m' (m'<1)	  m = 2C-m' (m'>C)
    n = n' (1<=n'<=L)	n = 1-n' (n'<1)	  n = 2L-n' (m'>L)
.fi

The size of the image is C x L.  The last two lines represent boundary
reflection at the edges of the image.

The sky sigma of a convolved pixel is approximated by

.nf
    sigma'(i,j) = sigma(i,j) / sum_kl{W(k,l)}
.fi

In the presence of bad pixels specified in the bad pixel mask the
convolution weight applied to a bad pixel is set to zero.  If the central
pixel is bad then the convolved value is also considered to be bad.  The
sum of the weights used to normalize the convolution is then modified from
the situation with no bad pixels.  This will correct the convolved pixel
value for the missing data and the estimated sky sigma is appropriately
larger.  Since there is an overhead in checking for bad pixels the
convolution has an optimization to avoid such checks in the case where no
bad pixel mask is specified.

A convolution can be computational slow, especially for larger convolution
kernel sizes.  The implementation of the convolution has been optimized to
recognize bilinear symmetries or lines which are scaled versions of other
lines.  So if possible users should chose convolutions with such symmetries
to be most efficient.  The "block", "bilinear", and "gauss" special
convolutions described below all have such symmetries.

The \fIconvolve\fR parameter is a string with one of the following forms.

.ls ""    
There is no convolution or, equivalently, NX=1, NY=1.
.le
.ls @[filename]
The weights are given in the specified file.  The format consists of lines
of whitespace separated values.  The number of values on each line must be
the same and defines NX and the number of lines defines NY.
.le
.ls block [NX] [NY]
The weights are all the same and the convolution size is given by the
two numbers following the word "block".  This is a moving block average
filter.
.le
.ls bilinear [NX] [NY]
The weights are the bilinear matrix product of triangular one dimensional
matrices of sizes given by the two numbers following the word "bilinear".
The weights are described by the matrix product relation 

.nf
    [1 ... (NX+1)/2 ... 1] * Transpose{[1 ... (NY+2)/2 ... 1]}
.fi

For example for NX=5, and NY=3 the weights would be

.nf
    1 2 3 2 1
    2 4 6 4 2
    1 2 3 2 1
.fi
.le
.ls gauss [NX] [NY] [SX] [SY]
The weights are bidimensional gaussian values on a grid of size NX by NY
with sigma values SX and SY (real numbers) in units of pixel spacing.
.le
.ls [W(1,1)] ... [W(NX,1)], ..., [W(1,NY)] ... [W(NX,NY)]
The weights are specified as a string of real values.  The values are
whitespace separated within each line and the lines are delimited by
comma.  For example

.nf
                               1 2 1
    1 2 1, 2 3 2, 1 2 1  ==>   2 3 2
                               1 2 1
.fi
.le

When a logfile is defined the convolution weights are included in the
output.

5. Object Detection

The detection of objects in an image is conceptually quite simple once the
background is known.  If an input pixel, before any convolution, is
identified in the bad pixel mask the output object mask pixel is also
identified as bad.  Otherwise the input data is convolved as described
previously.

Each convolved pixel is compared against the expected background at that
point and, if it is more that a specified number of convolution adjusted
background sigma above (\fIhsigma\fR) or below (\fIlsigma\fR) the
background, it is identified as a candidate object pixel.  Candidate object
pixels, with the same sense of deviation, are grouped into objects on
the basis of being connected along the four or eight neighboring directions
as specified by the \fIneighbor\fR parameter.  The candidate object is then
accepted if it satisfies the minimum number of pixels (\fIminpix\fR) in
an object and the \fIhdetect\fR or \fIldetect\fR parameter selects that
type of object.  The accepted objects are assigned sequential numbers
beginning with 11.  The object numbers are used, as described in the
section on the output data, to set the output object mask values.

If an output mean sky or sigma map is requested, the output is that
updated by the sky pixels identified during the detection.

6. Object Growing

Astronomical objects do not have sharp edges but have light distributions
that merge into the background.  This is due not only to the nature of
extended sources but to the atmospheric and instrument point spread function
effects on unresolved sources.  In order to include pixels which extend
away from the threshold detection and contain some amount of light
apart from the background, the task provides options to extend or grow
the object boundaries.  This is done by making multiple passes where
pixels which have not been identified as object pixels but which neighbor
object pixels are assigned to the object which they neighbor in any of
the eight directions.  Each pass can be thought of as adding a ring
of new pixels following the boundary of the object from the previous
pass.

When a non-object pixel neighbors two or more object pixels it is
assigned to the object with the greater "flux".  The flux is the sum
of the pixel value deviations from the background.

The parameter \fIngrow\fR selects the maximum number of growing iterations.
The parameter \fIagrow\fR selects the maximum fractional increase in
the number  of original detected object pixels.  The number of pixels
is called the "area"  of the object.  The growing of an object stops
when either maximum is exceedd at the end of a growing iteration.

EXAMPLES
1.  The following is a test example with default parameters that can be run
by anyone.  An artificial galaxy field image is generated with the task
\fBmkexample\fR (the \fBartdata\fR package is assumed to already be loaded)
and a mask is created with \fBobjmasks\fR.  The image is displayed with
the object mask overlayed in colors.

2.  In the first example there was no input mask.  The next example
creates a new object mask using the first object mask as an input
"bad pixel mask".  While this is not the usual usage of the bad pixel
mask it does illustrate an interesting option.  Note that the mask
values in the input mask are mapped to an output value of 1 in the
"colors" output.  In this example the output is forced to be a pl
file by using the explicit extension.

5.  This examples shows specifying the sky information as constant values.
In this case we already know that the artificial image has a
constant background of 400 and a sigma of 10.

.nf
    np> objmasks galfield gfmask3 sky=400 sigma=10
    ACE:
      Image: galfield - Example artificial galaxy field
      Set sky and sigma:
	Use constant input sky: 400.
	Use constant input sigma: 10.
      Detect objects:
	Convolution:
	       1.      1.      1.
	       1.      1.      1.
	       1.      1.      1.
	432 objects detected
      Grow objects: ngrow = 2, agrow = 2.
      Write object mask: gfmask3[pl,append,type=mask]
