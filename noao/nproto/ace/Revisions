convolve.x
    An amovki() call was mistakenly used as amovi() (6/3/13, MJF)

convolve.x
    The 'bpbuf' pointer was declared as TY_REAL instead of TY_INT (5/4/13)

objs.h
    Added P2R for 64-bit systems.

skyfit.x
    If a complete line is exceptionally deviant from the true sky it
    will bias the sky surface.  As a quick fix for the possibly common
    case that the first or last lines are high due to charge transfer
    effects, the lines to use was changed to start and end a half step
    from the ends.  This is only a quick fix and a more sophisticated
    solutions is needed.  (10/17/02, Valdes)

skyblock.x
    There was another bug in interp2.  (10/17/02, Valdes)

skyblock.x
    There was a bug in interp2.  (9/30/02, Valdes)

convolve.x
    Fixed error when reference image does not overlap target image on
    the right.  (9/23/02, Valdes)

detect.x
    The flux comparison in difference detection used sigma normalized
    fluxes.  This was changed to unnormalized fluxes which is done
    by using the same sigmas for the target and reference images.
    (9/23/02, Valdes)

t_acedetect.x
pars.x
diffdetect.pars
    Made changes for diffdetect.  (9/23/02, Valdes)

t_acedetect.x
    Switched over to the xtools version of xt_pmmap.
    (9/10/02, Valdes)

t_acedetect.x
skyblock.x
omwrite.x
    If DATASEC is present then it is automatically applied to the
    image.  It is also deleted from the output sky and mask since
    they will be the size of the data section.  (9/10/02, Valdes)

skyfit.x
    The sigma fit is now always a constant.  (8/6/02, Valdes)

skyblock.x
    Fixed a type mismatch in a min() function.  (6/13/02, Valdes)

=====
V2.12
=====

skyblock.x
    Changed algorithm for updating sky to do in place updates so that
    extensions might be used.  (12/21/01, Valdes)

detect.x
    The number of sky block lines was being wrong in using nc instead of nl.
    (12/21/01, Valdes)

t_acedetect.x
    The check on the number of catalog definitions files did not allow
    just one file when there was input list.  (12/20/01, Valdes)

t_acedetect.x
    The default catalog output is now STSDAS.  (5/7/01, Valdes)

mim.x
    When deleting the image name returned from imstats any image section
    needed to be stripped.  (5/7/01, Valdes)

mim.x
convolve.x
skyfit.x
skyimages.x
    Added error checking for calls to mim_glr.  (5/7/01, Valdes)

catdefine.x
    The reference to acesrc$ was replaced with ace$src/ in order to run
    standalone without additional environment definitions.  (5/7/01, Valdes)
