nproto.cl
nproto.hd
nproto.men
    Added a prototype script task to create a multispec format image from
    1D spectra including the associated arrays.  (1/7/03, Valdes)

ace/skyfit.x
    If a complete line is exceptionally deviant from the true sky it
    will bias the sky surface.  As a quick fix for the possibly common
    case that the first or last lines are high due to charge transfer
    effects, the lines to use was changed to start and end a half step
    from the ends.  This is only a quick fix and a more sophisticated
    solutions is needed.  (10/17/02, Valdes)

ace/skyblock.x
    There was another bug in interp2.  (10/17/02, Valdes)

ace/skyblock.x
    There was a bug in interp2.  (9/30/02, Valdes)

ace/convolve.x
    Fixed error when reference image does not overlap target image on
    the right.  (9/23/02, Valdes)

ace/detect.x
    The flux comparison in difference detection used sigma normalized
    fluxes.  This was changed to unnormalized fluxes which is done
    by using the same sigmas for the target and reference images.
    (9/23/02, Valdes)

ace/t_acedetect.x
ace/pars.x
ace/diffdetect.pars
    Made changes for diffdetect.  (9/23/02, Valdes)

ace/t_acedetect.x
    Switched over to the xtools version of xt_pmmap.
    (9/10/02, Valdes)

ace/t_acedetect.x
ace/skyblock.x
ace/omwrite.x
    If DATASEC is present then it is automatically applied to the
    image.  It is also deleted from the output sky and mask since
    they will be the size of the data section.  (9/10/02, Valdes)

ace/skyfit.x
    The sigma is fit by a constant to avoid potential negative sigmas.

noao$nproto/ace/xtmaskname.x
    Added check for optional environment variable "masktype" to force
    pl files if the value is "pl".  (3/1/02, Valdes)

noao$nproto/ace/xtpmmap.x

noao$nproto/nproto.cl
noao$nproto/nproto.men
noao$nproto/nproto.hd
    Removed FINDGAIN since a new version is in OBSUTIL.  The source and
    help are still in the directory for now.  (11/14/01, Valdes)

noao$nproto/t_irmosaic.x
    Modified the irmosaic task to avoid a potential divide by zero error
    in the range decoding software. This error was actually due to
    an interface change to the xtools$ranges.x code, which has since been
    changed back, but the potential for error was there. (8/22/97, Davis)

noao$nproto/linpol
    Added the PROTO package task LINPOL to NPROTO. (1/31/92, Davis)

noao$nproto/findgain, findthresh
    1. The findgain and findthresh tasks in the kpno local package were
    added to the nproto package.  (1/31/92, Davis)

noao$nproto/
    1.  The proto directory was renamed to nproto and all reference to proto
    were replaced by nproto.

    2. The IMEDIT, IMEXAMINE, and TVMARK tasks from NOAO.PROTO have been moved
    to the IMAGES.TV package.

    3. The IMTITLE, MKHISTOGRAM, and RADPLT tasks in NOAO.PROTO have been moved
    to the OBSOLETE package. They are superseded by the HEDIT, PHISTOGRAM, and
    PRADPROF tasks respectively.

    4. The BINFIL, BSCALE, EPIX, FIELDS, FIXPIX, IMALIGN, IMCENTROID, IMCNTR,
    IMFUNCTION, IMREPLACE, IMSCALE, INTERP, IRAFIL, and JOIN tasks were
    moved to the new core package PROTO.

    (1/23/92, Davis Valdes)

======================
Package reorganization
======================

proto$imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Corrected an error in the column limits computation in the routine
    ie_get_vector that caused occasional glitches in vectors plotted
    using the 'v' key. This bug may also explain occasional unrepeatable
    bus errors which occurred after using the 'v' key. (12/11/91, Davis)

proto$imedit/epcolon.x
    Two calls to pargr changed to pargi.  (11/13/91, Valdes)

proto$tvmark/t_tvmark.x
proto$tvmark/mkcolon.x
    Removed extra argument to mk_sets() calls. (11/13/91, Davis)

    Changed two clputi calls to clputb calls. (11/13/91, Davis)


proto$t_fixpix.x
proto$doc/t_fixpix.x
    Made the order of lower/upper columns/lines unimportant by internally
    transposing the endpoints if not in increasing order.  (10/31/91, Valdes)

proto$imfuncs.gx
proto$imfuncs.x
    The reference to the E macro in math.h was replaced with a reference to
    the new macro BASE_E.

    (8/29/91 LED)

proto$bscale.par
proto$t_bscale.x
proto$mkpkg
proto$doc/bscale.hlp
    Installed a new version of the bscale task. The new task takes a list
    of input images and produces a list of output images like most other
    images tasks. The input images are overwritten if the output list equals
    the input list, and the noact parameter was removed since it is no longer
    required.  Two new parameters upper and lower can be used to remove
    outliers from the statistics computation. The logfile parameter was
    removed and replaced with the verbose parameter. Finally the code was
    modified to only use the step parameter for sampling along a particular
    axis, if no reference is made to that axis in the section parameter.
    (8/26/91 LED)

    (10/25/90, Davis)

proto$imexamine/iesimexam.x
    Add code for checking and warning if data is all constant, all above the
    specified ceiling, or all below the specified floor when making surface
    plots.  (10/3/90, Valdes)

proto$imedit/epmask.x
    Added some protective changes so that if a radius of zero with a circular
    aperture is used then round off will be less likely to cause missing
    the pixel.  (9/23/90, Valdes)

proto$tvmark/tvmark.key
proto$tvmark/mkmark.x
proto$tvmark/doc/tvmark.hlp
    At user request changed the 'd' keystroke command  which marks an object
    with a dot to the '.' and the 'u' keystroke command which deletes a
    point to 'd'. (9/14/90 Davis)

V2.9
====

noao$proto
    Davis, June 20, 1990
    The prototype tasks IMSLICE and IMSTACK were removed from the PROTO
    package. Their functionality is duplicated by tasks of the same
    name in the IMAGES package. 

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, June 6, 1990
    The fixpix format input was selecting interpolation across the longer
    dimension instead of the shorter.  This meant that complete columns
    or lines did not work at all.

noao$proto/t_fixpix.x
    Davis, May 29, 1990
    Modified fixpix so that it would work on unsigned short images.

====
V2.8
====

noao$proto/
    Davis, April 6, 1990
    Two new tasks IMALIGN and IMCENTROID written by Rob Seaman were added
    to the proto package. IMCENTROID computes a set of relative shifts
    required to register a set of images. IMALIGN both computes the
    shifts and aligns the images.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 29, 1990
    Even when use_display=no the task was trying to check the image display
    for the name.  This was fixed by adding a check for this flag in the
    relevant if statement.

noao$proto/imexamine/ievimexam.x
    Valdes, Mar 22, 1990
    The pset was being closed without indicating this in the data structure.
    The clcpset statement was removed.

noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 15, 1990
    The EOF condition was being screwed up for two keystroke commands leading
    to a possible infinite loop when using a cursor file input.  The fix
    is to change the "nitems=nitems+clgcur" incrementing to simply
    "nitems=clgcur".

noao$proto/imedit/epbackground.x
noao$proto/imedit/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Mar 9, 1990
    1. The surfit pointer was incorrectly declared as real in ep_bg causing the
    'b' key to do nothing.  This appears to be SPARC dependent.
    2. Fixed some more problems with cursor strings having missing coordinates
    causing floating overflow errors.

noao$proto/iralign.par,ir/t_iralign.x
    Davis, Feb 27, 1990
    Changed the iralign parameter align to alignment for consistency with
    the other tasks.

noao$proto/imexamine/iecolon.x
    Valdes, Feb 16, 1990
    Fixed a mistake in the the datatype of a parg call.

noao$proto/ir/
    Davis, Feb 16, 1990
    Added a feature to the iralign code that permits the user to rerun
    the iralign, irmatch1d, and irmatch2d  using the first runs output
    as input. This permits the user to fine tune the intensity adjustments
    and shifts.

    Added compiled version of the join task and updated the documentation.
    Note that the parameters are now different.

noao$proto/imedit.par
noao$proto/imedit/epcolon.x
noao$proto/imedit/epmask.x
    Valdes, Jan 17, 1990
    1. Fixed typo in prompt string for y background order.
    2. Wrong datatype in clput for order parameters resulting in setting
       the user parameter file value to 0.
    3. Bug fix in epmask.  The following is the correct line:
       line 130:    call amovi (Memi[line], Memi[ptr2+i*EP_NX(ep)], EP_NX(ep))

noao$proto/imedit/epdisplay.x
    Valdes, Jan 7, 1990
    Added initialization to the zoom state.  Without the intialization
    starting IMEDIT without display and then turning display on followed by
    a 'r' would cause an error (very obscure but found in a demo).

noao$proto/tvmark/t_tvmark.x
noao$proto/tvmark/mkmark.x
noao$proto/tvmark/tvmark.key
noao$proto/doc/tvmark.hlp
    Valdes, Jan 4, 1990

noao$proto/tvmark/mkremove.x
    Davis, Dec 12, 1989
    1. Tvmark has been modified to permit deletion as well as addition of
    objects to the coordinate file. Objects to be deleted are marked
    with the cursor and must be within a given tolerance of an
    object in the coordinate list to be deleted.
    2. The help screen no longer comes up in the text window when the task
    is invoked for the sake of uniformity with all other IRAF tasks.
    3. The coordinate file is opened read_only in batch mode. In interactive
    mode a warning message is issued if the user tries to append or delete
    objects from a file which does not have write permission and no action
    is taken.

noao$proto/imexamine/t_imexam.x
noao$proto/imexamine/iegimage.x
    Valdes, Nov 30, 1989
    The default display frame when not using an input list was changed from
    0 to 1.

noao$proto/ir/
    Davis, Nov 28, 1989
    New versions of the proto tasks IRMOSAIC, IRALIGN, IRMATCH1D and
    IRMATCH2D have been installed in the PROTO package. The routine
    have been modularised and now share code in preparation for a
    future database approach to the registration problem. The image i/o
    has been optimized so that all the tasks, but IRMOSAIC in particular,
    will run much faster. A bug in the alignment code in which errors of
    alignment of up to 0.5 pixels can occur has been fixed.
    There is now an option to trim each section before insertion into
    the output image. Finally the actions taken by the task can optionally
    be printed on the terminal.

noao$proto/imeidt/epgcur.x
    Valdes, Oct 30, 1989
    1. There was no check against INDEF cursor coordinates.  Such coordinates
    will occur when reading a previous logfile output and cursor input
    where the shorthand ":command" is used.  The actual error occured when
    attempting to add 0.5 to INDEF.

noao$proto/imedit/epnoise.x
noao$proto/imedit/epbackground.x
noao$proto/imedit/t_imedit.x
    Valdes, Aug 17, 1989
    1. Added errchk to main cursor loop to try and prevent loss of the
       user's changes if an error occurs.
    2. If no background points are found an error message is now printed
       instead of aborting.

noao$proto/tvmark/mkbmark.x
    Davis, Aug 4, 1989
    Modified tvmark so that drawing to the frame buffer is more efficient
    in batch mode. This involved removing a number of imflush calls
    which were unnecessarily flushing the output buffer to disk and
    recoding the basic routines which draw concentric circles and rectangles.

noao$proto/imreplace.par
    Valdes, July 20, 1989
    Changed mode of imaginary component value to hidden.

    New task IMEXAMINE added to the proto package.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June 6, 1989
    Fixed a bug in tvmark wherein circles were not being drawn if they
    were partially off the image in the x dimension.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis, June1, 1989
    A labeling capability has been added to tvmark. If the label parameter
    is turned on tvmark will label objects with the string in the third
    column of the coordinate file.

noao$proto/tvmark/
    Davis,  May 25, 1989
    The problem reported by phil wherein TVMARK would go into an infinite
    loop if it encountered a blank line has been fixed.

    of the complex values and the replacement value specified as real
    and imaginary.

noao$proto/tvmark
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task TVMARK was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/imedit/
    Davis,  May 22, 1989
    The new task IMEDIT was added to the proto package.

noao$proto/t_binfil.x
    Rooke, Apr 28, 1989
    After allocating temporary storage for header bytes in IRAFIL, the code
    was then reading those bytes instead into pixel storage, resulting in
    a segmentation violation if header > row of pixels (found by Jim
    Klavetter).

noao$proto/epix/epgdata.x
    Valdes, Mar 20, 1989
    Limit checking on the requested data region was wrong.  User would get
    out of bounds message if the line desired was greater than the number
    of columns.
 
noao$proto/t_bscale.x
    Davis, Feb 7, 1989
    Fixed a memory corruption error in bscale. If a user specified a section
    using the section parameter, the task was overflowing the data array
    by trying to read beyond the boundary of the section. 

    Fixed a floating divide by zero problem in the computation of
    step sizes when a specified section was only one pixel
    wide in a given dimension.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Jan 26, 1989
    A "pixel out of bounds" error was fixed in the task IRMATCH2D. This
    would occur if nxsub != nysub and for certain combination of corner
    and order. This bug has been fixed.

noao$proto/
    Davis, Nov 8, 1988
    The two prototype image intensity matching tasks IRMATCH1D and IRMATCH2D
    have been added to the proto package. See the help pages for further
    details.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Jul 23, 1988
    The number of columns and rows between adjacent subrasters in the output
    image produced by IRMOSAIC was incorrect if nxoverlap or nyoverlap were
    less than -1.

noao$proto/t_imslice.x
    Davis, Jul 8, 1988
    A new task imslice has been added to the proto package. IMSLICE reduces
    an n-dimensional image to a list of (n-1)-dimensional images.

    into one procedure.

noao$proto/t_mkhistogram.x
    Davis, Feb 5, 1988
    A new task mkhistogram has been added to the proto package. Mkhistogram
    will task a stream of data and list or plot the histogram of the data.

noao$proto/t_irmosaic.x
    Davis, Feb 3, 1988
    1. A new parameter "subtract" has been added to the IRMOSAIC task. If
    the "median" parameter is yes then IRMOSAIC will subtract the median
    from each subraster before adding it to the output image mosaic.

noao$proto
    Davis, Dec 8, 1987
    1. Two new tasks IRMOSAIC and IRALIGN have been added to the PROTO
    package. IRMOSAIC takes an ordered list of input images and places them
    on a grid in an output image. Options exist to order the input list
    by row, column or in a raster pattern starting at any of the four
    corners of the output image. Adjacent subrasters may be overlapped or
    separated by a specified number of columns and rows. Positions of objects
    which occur in adjacent subrasters can be marked using for example
    the sun imtool facility and centered using the APPHOT center routine.
    IRALIGN takes the mosaiced image and the coordinate list and produces an
    output image where all the individual subrasters have been aligned with
    respect to some reference subraster.  These two tasks are most useful for
    images which already lie approximately on a grid.

noao$proto/t_bscale.x +

noao$proto/doc/bscale.hlp +
    Valdes, October 7, 1988
    A new task to compute to scale images by a zero point and scale factor
    has been added.  The zero point and scale factor can be chosen as the
    mean, median, or mode of the images.

noao$proto/doc/replicate.hlp -
    Valdes, June 4, 1987
    1.  Deleted this obsolete file.

noao$proto/toonedspec.x
noao$proto/doc/toonedspec.hlp
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The output spectra are now of type real regardless of the input
	pixel type.  This change was made to avoid fix point exceptions
	on AOS/VS IRAF when summing enough lines to overflow the input
	pixel type.  On the other IRAF systems integer overflows only cause
	erroneous output but no error.

noao$proto/fixline.gx
    Valdes, April 27, 1987
    1.  The interpolation weights when interpolating across lines were
	being truncated and producing approximately correct values
	but not correct interpolation.  The weights are now not truncated.

noao$proto/join.cl
    Hammond, March 10, 1987
    1. Added script task JOIN, which joins two lists line by line.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
    Valdes, March 3, 1987
    1.  The input images being stacked were not being closed after they
	were added to the output image.

noao$proto/imrep.gx
    Valdes, February 5, 1987
    1.  There was a problem in AOS iraf because of an attempt to convert
	a real INDEF to a short value.  The routine was modified to attempt
	the conversion only if the value is not INDEF.

noao$proto/t_imstack.x
noao$proto/doc/imstack.hlp
    Valdes, October 8, 1986
